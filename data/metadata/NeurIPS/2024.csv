This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill composition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we consider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a  x + b  y \text{ mod } p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use some of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution testing. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition from in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of pre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of out-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for deeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is *transient*, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an interpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing highly structured representations in both attention heads and MLPs; and discuss the learned algorithms. Notably, we find an algorithmic shift in deeper models, as we go from few to many in-context examples.",Oral Session 1A: Neuroscience and Intepretability,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=aVh9KRZdRk,https://openreview.net/forum?id=aVh9KRZdRk,aVh9KRZdRk,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""This paper studies the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in Transformers.

This differs from commonly discussed cases of linear regression, where the set of tasks is infinite (and, in fact, _continuous_). Consequently, the number of pre-training tasks (as a fraction of the total tasks $p^2$) is a natural measure of task diversity. There is a subtlety in that tasks may not be completely independent from each other, and a true definition of task diversity should include a reference to independence. However, it is not clear to what extent the model leverages this possible redundancy -- and similar point is also omitted in the works on linear regression. We decided to not go down that rabbit hole and defined task diversity in a naive way.\n\nThat being said, we acknowledge that different ways of sampling the task sequences could also influence o.o.d. generalization. To address this, one might construct a phase diagram with an additional axis representing task sampling. However, this would require an order of magnitude more computations and a detailed multi-page discussion, making it impractical for our current study.\n\n\n**Early Stopping and Larger Models**:\nWe appreciate the reviewer raising this point. \nFirst, we would like to clarify that the ""larger model"" mentioned in line 52 refers to the comparison between the $d=6$ model and the $d=2,4$ models used throughout the paper. \nNotably, these settings are sufficient to demonstrate our point, as the model\'s scale should be measured relative to the dataset size. The SoTA LLMs are pretrained on corpora much larger and diverse than the arithmetic tasks that we study in this work. We agree that larger-scale experiments would be necessary to transfer the insights gained from our study to modern LLMs. However, such experiments are far beyond our current capabilities due to limited GPU resources. \nFinally, the purpose of including details such as early stopping is to aid reproducibility of our results -- we do hope that the community will explore and generalize our setting.\n\n**Relation to meta-learning and continual learning**:\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out this interesting connection. It is indeed possible that some of the insights from our work finds connections to these areas. In the current version, we have cited one work [1] related to meta-learning. In the camera-ready version, we will include a more elaborate discussion with more references.\nWe welcome suggestions for specific resources about continue learning that the reviewer has in mind relevant to our study.\n\n## Question\n\nThe reviewer raises an interesting point about the hierarchy of skills, and is correct in pointing out that multiplication can indeed be constructed from repeated additions. \nHowever, it is important to think from the model\'s perspective. We believe that *efficient* implementation of finite field operations by the model requires separate components to perform addition and multiplication. One intuitive way to think about this is that the models do not have sufficient depth to perform arbitrary repeated additions to construct multiplication. Instead, the models build correct representations to implement multiplication.\nConsequently, it is better to think of the numbers on a finite field $\\mathrm{GF}(p)$, with distinct operations of addition and multiplication.\n\n[1] Louis Kirsch, James Harrison, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, and Luke Metz; ""General-purpose in-context learning by meta-learning transformers""; https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04458 (2022)'}}, 'id': 'CzZnc2zA6V', 'forum': 'aVh9KRZdRk', 'replyto': 'RPlLeNuaca', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722914468420, 'cdate': 1722914468420, 'tmdate': 1730884438688, 'mdate': 1730884438688, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the encouraging feedback and valuable comments.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n1. **Delicate training set-up**: \nThe structured selection of tasks (rectangular rule) and balanced batches largely serve the purpose of making the pre-training more stable. Our intuition for using the specific setup was to reduce batch noise, as the training itself is challenging for this task. We strongly believe that scaling up the batch-size and model sizes will alleviate these constraints. We did not explore this avenue due to compute restrictions.\n\nWe will add this clarification to the final version of the paper.\n\n2. **The mechanistic analysis is only partial**: We have included additional results in the Global Rebuttal and the attached PDF, further strengthening our analysis. Notably, this includes highly structured neuronal activation patterns (Figure G.1). However, the end-to-end algorithm still remains an open question.\n\n3. **Relationship to prior work**:\nWe will incorporate the reviewer\'s suggestion into the camera-ready version of our paper.\n\n4. **Minor Text Errors**:\nWe have addressed all the minor errors pointed out by the reviewer, except one, which is not an error. Specifically, equation (2) and line 203 are not typographical errors. \nThe algorithm we propose differs from the conventional method humans use to solve linear systems of equations, which involves explicitly computing the coefficients $(a,b)$ from the in-context examples. Instead of finding the unknowns $(a,b)$, the model finds the right way to ""linearly combine"" $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ to equal $(x,y)$. The re-scaling factors $c_1, c_2$ in this linear combination can then be used to get the correct answer: $z = c_1 z_1^t + c_2 z_2^t$. To emphasize this point, we have modified Equation (2), which now reads:\n$$c_1 (x_1, \\\\; y_1 ) + c_2 (x_2, \\\\; y_2 ) = (x, \\\\; y) \\\\; \\mathrm{mod} \\\\; p\n\\qquad \\xrightarrow{\\text{find} \\\\; c_1, c_2} \\qquad \nz = c_1 z_1^t + c_2 z_2^t \\\\;\\mathrm{mod} \\\\; p \\\\; \\qquad\\qquad (2)$$\n\n    Here is an intuitive way to think about the algorithm: Instead of directly solving for the unknowns $(a, b)$, the model treats the in-context examples $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ as vectors. The task then becomes to fill in the last component of a new vector $(x, y, ?)$. By aligning the first two components using coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$: $c_1 (x_1, y_1) + c_2 (x_2, y_2) = (x, y)$ mod $p$, the model naturally finds out the correct way of aligning $z_1$ and $z_2$ with $?$, given the fact that they are constructed with a same underlying linear relation $a x + b y$ mod $p$.\n\n    We will add a version of this explanation to the final version of the paper to enhance clarity.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. On the origin of the title: The authors have always been of the opinion that the central theme in grokking is the formation of highly structured representations at the end of training. In fact, these representations can be viewed as a 1st order phase transition (in the proper statistical mechanics sense as explained in https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03789). \nIf we take this perspective then in the present work grokking happens in _two_ qualitatively different ways: (i) _as optimization time passes_ the model learns to solve the task in-distribution (and sometimes o.o.d.), which requires highly structured representations, and (ii) _as the number of in-context examples increases during inference_ the model performance steadily improves; completely solving the arithmetic problem with enough in-context examples. It is crucial that the predictions are conditioned on the sequence of in-context examples and this conditioning is _emergent_. A more accurate name could be ""grokking grokking"", but we decided to opt for a milder version.\n\n2. We thank the reviewer for pointing out the cumbersome phrasing. We have edited the part of the caption in Figure 1 that distinguishes various phases to make it clearer. The part of the caption now reads: \n\n    > **(b)** Phase diagram for a six-layer model. We find four different phases. (1) in-distribution memorization: The model *only* performs well on tasks $(a,b)$ *and* examples $(x,y)$ from the training set -- it does not generalize on unseen examples or tasks. (2) in-distribution generalization: model generalizes on unseen examples $(x,y)$ but not on unseen tasks $(a,b)$. (3) out-of-distribution memorization: model generalizes on unseen tasks $(a,b)$ but only for examples $(x,y)$ it has seen during training. (4) out-of-distribution generalization: model generalizes on unseen tasks $(a,b)$ for seen as well as unseen examples $(x,y)$. We focus on investigating phase (4) in more detail.\n\n    Additionally, we will add a table clarifying the performance on the sets $S_{train}^{i.d.}, S_{test}^{i.d.}, S_{train}^{o.o.d.}, S_{test}^{o.o.d.}$ in the four different phases, on page 4 of the main text. We hope that this will help avoiding any possible confusion in the definition of the phases.'}}, 'id': '1a5PDORc6z', 'forum': 'aVh9KRZdRk', 'replyto': 'ZLQwBMiHgE', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722827898384, 'cdate': 1722827898384, 'tmdate': 1730884438547, 'mdate': 1730884438547, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': '# Global Rebuttal\n\nWe included three new figures in the attached one-page PDF. These new results address questions raised by one or more of the reviewers. Especially, the results about MLP layers are relevant to multiple reviews.\n\n## Figure G.1\nWe examined how individual neurons (post-ReLU) are activated for different inputs $(x,y)$. We discovered that each neuron only gets activated for highly specific inputs. This can be interpreted as a further skill composition at the neuron level, although the exact role of each neuron remains to be discovered.\n\nNotably, in Layer 3 of the $d=4$ model we find that neuronal activations follow the re-scaling relation $x = k y$. The layer contains all such re-scalings, forming a complete basis. Layer 2 of the $d=4$ model show a periodic pattern wrt $(x,y)$, while Layer 1 neurons only get activated only for specific $x$ values.\n\nNeurons in the $d=2$ model appear to be superposed/compressed versions of those found in the $d=4$ model. This is likely due to $d=2$ model not having enough layers. We observe that the neurons from Layer 1 of the $d=2$ model contains patters similar to Layer 1 and 2 of the $d=4$ model. Neurons from Layer 2 of the $d=2$ model appear to be superpositions of various re-scaling patterns from Layer 3 of $d=4$ model.\n\n## Figure G.2\nWe expanded upon the PCA plots of the $d=2$ model presented in Figure 6 of the original manuscript. In this extension, we included a different task vector $(a, b)$ and plotted the results using a different shot (16-shot).\n\nWe see that The top-3,4 components of PCA of layer 1, head 3 also forms circle of circles, albeit with a different pattern from that of top-1,2 components. In this case, we find pairs of coinciding circles, where the $x$ corresponding to the coinciding circles differ by $(p-1)/2 = 14$.\n\nIn layer 2, head 2 we can see that the PCA pattern changes for different tasks. This is in contrast to the layer 1 PCA patterns, which remain unchanged. (as claimed in the main text)\n\n## Figure G.3\nWe performed PCA on both (i) Attention output (as opposed to individual heads) and (ii) MLP output of the $d=2$ model. In the Attention output of Layer 1, we observe a circle-of-circle structure. The other components also exhibit some structure -- notably, the top-3,4 components in layer 1 form 4 clusters corresponding to even/odd $X$ and $y$ values.\n\n## Additional Experiments\n\nIn addition to these results, we also ran a few more experiments. Due to space constraints, we could not include them in the one-page PDF. We describe these experiments and results in words here -- we will include them in the camera-ready version of the paper.\n\n1. Linear probing of $c_1$ and $c_2$: We extracted the feature from the residual stream after each transformer block; attached a new linear layer and fine-tuned it to predict the correct re-scaling coefficients. \n\n    We simplified the experiment to the $1$-shot case, where the sequences are simply $(x_1, y_1, z_1, x, y, ?)$. The fine-tuned linear layer was used to predict the correct coefficients $c_1$ such that $x_1 \\cdot c_1 = x$ mod $p$ (alternatively $y_1 \\cdot c_1 = y$ can be used). We observed $15 \\\\% - 20 \\\\%$ accuracy across all the layers for both $d=2$ and $d=4$ models. Despite the accuracy being above random guessing ($3\\%$), we believe this result to be inconclusive.\n\n2. Linear probing of (a,b): We also ran similar experiments with full sequences ($1$-shot to $31$-shots) and tried to predict the task vector $(a, b)$ along the sequence. We found random performance on the o.o.d. generalization set, suggesting that the model does not explicitly compute the task vector. Note that this is in agreement with our proposed algorithm.\n\n3. Pruning / Activation Patching [1]: In this experiment, we replaced the output of each attention head with its averaged output over pre-training sequences. The average was taken over all the pre-training tasks, and $512$ sequences from each task. We found that:\n    \n    - For both $d=2$ and $ d=4$ models, pruning the circle-of-circle head immediately brings the model to random guessing. This can be understood as an average over sequences collapsing the circle down to a point, which destroys the feature completely.\n\n    - For the $d=2$ model, pruning any other head causes some performance drop. This is to be expected since the model does not have enough capacity even before patching.\n\n    - The $d=4$ model is significantly more robust to pruning. We can patch all heads except for (i) the three shown in Figure 11 of the manuscript and (ii) the heads in the last layer, with almost no impact on the performance (less than a $5\\\\%$ performance drop).\n\n[1] Fred Zhang, Neel Nanda; ""Towards Best Practices of Activation Patching in Language Models: Metrics and Methods""; https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16042'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/dd22b9962d4d90f2262b68359c6dd7a071c6859c.pdf'}}, 'id': 'ZAj6s2ai4u', 'forum': 'aVh9KRZdRk', 'replyto': 'aVh9KRZdRk', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/-/Author_Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722826779893, 'cdate': 1722826779893, 'tmdate': 1730888366347, 'mdate': 1730888366347, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the encouraging feedback and incisive questions.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n**Emergent abilities / Grokking**:\nThe loss and accuracy curves are already presented in Figure 3 of the current version of the paper. We agree that the gradual emergence of useful representations as a function of training time are useful results to showcase. In the final version of the paper, we will also include the feature analysis (similar to Figures 5,6) for intermediate checkpoints during training -- as suggested by the reviewer. (Note that we have not included these plots in the PDF of the Global Rebuttal due to space constraints.)\n\nWe also note that we exercise a broader take on emergent ability than only learning dynamics. Emergent behaviours [1] are characterized by qualitative changes in model capabilities upon scaling-up (i) model size, (ii) dataset size, (ii) training duration, (iii) task-diversity etc. While the transition with training duration is an interesting aspect of the literature on Grokking, it is only one part of the emergent phenomena in deep learning. Moreover, careful initialization and optimization have been known to mitigate such effects [2]. However, the transition in capabilities with respect to dataset and model sizes are known to be more robust. \n\n**Pre-training task and batch selection**: \nThe structured selection of tasks (rectangular rule) and balanced batches largely serve the purpose of making the pre-training more stable. Our intuition for using the specific setup was to reduce batch noise, as the training itself is challenging for this task. We strongly believe that scaling up the batch-size and model sizes will alleviate these constraints. We did not explore this avenue due to compute restrictions. \n\n## Questions\n\n**o.o.d. vs pre-training performance**:\nThe performance trade-off between o.o.d. and pre-training is more clear in the $d=2$ and $d=4$ models, shown in Figure 4. We will update line 147 and add a reference to the phase diagrams in Figure 4.\n\n**Equation 2**:\nFollowing the reviewer\'s suggestion, we will modify Equation (2) to read as follows: \n$$c_1 (x_1, \\\\; y_1 ) + c_2 (x_2, \\\\; y_2 ) = (x, \\\\; y) \\\\; \\mathrm{mod} \\\\; p\n\\qquad \\xrightarrow{\\text{find} \\\\; c_1, c_2} \\qquad \nz = c_1 z_1^t + c_2 z_2^t \\\\; \\mathrm{mod} \\\\; p \\\\; \\qquad\\qquad (2)$$\n\nFor completion, we provide an explanation of the algorithm here: The model finds the right way to ""linearly combine"" $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ to equal $(x,y)$. The re-scaling factors $c_1, c_2$ in this linear combination can then be used to get the correct answer: $z = c_1 z_1^t + c_2 z_2^t$. Here is an intuitive way to think about the algorithm: Instead of directly solving for the unknowns $(a, b)$, the model treats the in-context examples $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ as vectors. The task then becomes to fill in the last component of a new vector $(x, y, ?)$. By aligning the first two components using coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$: $c_1 (x_1, y_1) + c_2 (x_2, y_2) = (x, y)$ mod $p$, the model naturally finds out the correct way of aligning $z_1$ and $z_2$ with $?$, given the fact that they are constructed with a same underlying linear relation $a x + b y$ mod $p$.\n\nWe will add a version of this explanation to the final version of the paper to enhance clarity.\n\n**Galois Field**:\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing definition of Galois Field. We will include that in the final version.\n\n**Figure 6 and attention heads**:\nThe results in Figure 6 are for $d=2$. We will specify that in the caption as well as the main text in the final version.\n\nIn the Appendix of the final version of the paper, we will extend Figure 11 to include all the attention heads from the $d=4$ model. Unfortunately we cannot show them in the Global Rebuttal PDF due to space constraints.\n\n**Task dependence of Figure 6(b)**:\nIn Figure G.2 of the attached PDF (Global Rebuttal) we present the PCA of attention heads for multiple tasks. Taking a close look at the first column in the layer 2, head 2 case, we see that the attention pattern is different for the two different tasks. \n% (Note that the layer 2, head 2 plots may seem denser than Figure 6(b).

We will add the citations and utilize the additional page allowance in the final version to discuss their relation to our work.\n\n## Questions\n\n**PCA Analysis**: We conducted PCA without any preprocessing. As per the reviewer's suggestion, we expanded upon Figure 6 from the original manuscript by plotting higher order PCA components. The results are presented in Figure G.2 of the attached PDF and discussed in the Global Rebuttal. We analysed the top-4 components, and found highly structured features. The top-4 PCA components account for a significant portion of the PCA variance. (Note that we present 2d slices instead of 3d plots of PCA because sparse 3d plots shown in 2d are difficult to comprehend.)\n\nFurthermore, following the suggestion of the reviewer rwBm, we plot similar features with a different task vector $(a,b)$ and a different number of shots. These results serve as evidence for the claims made in Figure 6 caption. Specifically, the PCA constructed from the first layer's head remains unchanged across different task vectors (up to a negative sign along certain directions). In contrast, the PCA derived from the second layer's head changes with the choice of task vector.\n\n**PCA of Attention outputs**: As per the suggestion of the reviewer, we present the PCA analysis of Attention outputs (as opposed to individual heads) in the top row of Figure G.3 of the attached PDF. We find highly structured top-4 PCA patterns in Layer 1, which also account for a significant fraction of PCA variance. Layer 2 exhibits less structured organization and the contribution of the top-4 PCA components is diminished.\n\n**Analysis of MLP features**: In the attached PDF, we have added two main results concering MLPs. \n\n1.  We extended our analysis to include PCA Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) features, as shown in the bottom row of Figure G.3 of the attached PDF. The results demonstrate:\n\n- Layer 1: Highly structured patterns are evident in MLP features. The top-4 components contribute substantially to the overall PCA variance.\n\n- Layer 2: Features exhibit less structured organization, and the significance of the top-4 components is diminished compared to Layer 1.\n\n2. Additionally, in Figure G.1 of the attached PDF, we have shown the post-ReLU neuronal activations from various layers as functions of $x,y$. We find highly structured activation patterns across layers, especially in Layer 3 of $d=4$ model. For a detailed account of the MLP results, please refer to the Global Rebuttal.\n\nWe will discuss these new results in the additional page allowance of the final version. We believe that in a future work, our analysis of the attention heads as well as MLP activations can be tied together to infer an end-to-end algorithm for our setting.""}}, 'id': 'hcOegsgI0b', 'forum': 'aVh9KRZdRk', 'replyto': 'm1s5JPqAc9', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21497/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722820940673, 'cdate': 1722820940673, 'tmdate': 1730884438835, 'mdate': 1730884438835, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'This paper develops novel insights into in-context learning and how it works in Transformers.

For example, the results by Kirsch et al. (which is cited) are very similar to what authors show, especially results on scaling effects. The main different is width scaling in that paper and no geometric analysis, but nonetheless the relationship warranted more emphasis and discussion. Similarly, several recent works have explored OOD generalization of toy ICL tasks defined in prior works (e.g., see Ahuja and Lopez-Paz [1] for work on linear regression tasks and Ramesh et al. [2] for group arithmetic tasks). Regarding grokking, there are several works exploring the phase transition-y nature of this task. For example, see Kumar et al. [3].

If there are other components that are not shown but have a large variance, what do those components encode---can you try 3D plots?\n\n- **What does the MLP do?** Given the mechinterp focused on attention solely, it is unclear what role MLPs played. Two experiments to try here are: (i) train attention only models to see if MLPs are even necessary, and (ii) perform the PCA analysis to uncover representations\' geometry at the level of attentions and MLPs at each block in the model. Experiment (i) may require retraining models, so I understand if the authors are unable to conduct it, but my expectation will be that you will see that model ""internalizes"" task vectors and records them in MLPs. Attention only models can solve the task, but I expect the representations\' geometry will be quite different. For experiment (ii) however, I expect that\'s easy to run and is merely repeating the plotting script on intermediate representations as a forward pass occurs through the model.

We will try our best to address your concerns with planned revisions based on your valuable feedback.\n\n**Response to Weakness 1:**\n\nThank you for your detailed feedback. Our analysis of tree-structured models indeed draws inspiration from previous work, particularly in the context of hierarchical multi-class classification[1]. Our contribution, in addition to the main difference of extending the analysis to the Beam Search algorithm, also provides a more refined estimate specifically tailored to the tree model. Specifically, we use the mapping $c(f, \\boldsymbol{x}, y)=\\left(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\prime}\\right)$, which establishes a correspondence between a sample point $(x,y)$ and both the target node and the Top-K scoring nodes along the search path within the tree. This mapping allows us to partition the $m$ sample points into several disjoint sets $ \\lbrace (x_i,y_i): c\\left(f, \\boldsymbol{x}_i, y_i\\right)=\\left(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\prime}\\right) \\rbrace $, each corresponding to different node pairs in the tree. Unlike prior work[1],  the proof of Theorem 1 in [1], where a trivial upper bound of $m$ is used for the size of these sets, we provide individual estimates for each set’s size. By combining these estimates, we derive a tighter overall result, leading to a key conclusion that increasing the number of branches helps to reduce the generalization error—an insight not directly captured in [1].\n\nRegarding Rademacher complexity, our model introduces an additional tree structure, distinguishing it from traditional linear models and MLPs. Our analytical approach involves separating the traditional scoring model from the tree structure component, corresponding to the term $\\mathcal{T}$ in the upper bound of the Rademacher complexity in our analysis. This reduction maps the problem to the scoring function space of traditional models, making existing analysis techniques applicable. We appreciate your comments regarding our references, and we will ensure that these works are properly cited in future revisions.\n\n[1] Rohit Babbar et al.

We will include experimental results in the revised manuscript to demonstrate the ranker model's performance at different recall rates.\n\nIn our experiments, we varied the number of items retrieved by the model to adjust the recall rate. With $ K=40 $ fixed during inference, from Tables 1 and 2, it can be observed that the ranker model's performance significantly declined when the recall rate was as low as 7.5\\% due to insufficient training data. However, when the recall rate exceeded 10.7\\%, the model consistently showed improvement.\n\nThe improvement in the ranker model's performance depends on sufficient training data and alignment with the target distribution.  It can be observed that once the recall rate reaches a sufficient threshold, further increases in the recall rate actually cause the performance of the trained ranker model in the two-stage classification process to gradually decline, approaching the performance of the ranker model trained on the original distribution, i.e., the complete dataset. This decline occurs because the training data distribution starts to deviate from the target distribution. The most optimal setting may be to keep the number of retrieved items consistent between training and inference, provided the recall rate is relatively high in this scenario.\nExperimental results show that limited data initially hinders performance, but as data and alignment improve, performance increases. However, excessive data leads to misalignment and a subsequent performance decline, consistent with theoretical predictions. For a quantitative result in theory, if we use a sampling method to estimate the error between distributions, defined as \n$err_{\\mathcal{D}} := \\mathbb{E} _{ (\\boldsymbol{x}, y) \\sim \\mathcal{D}}|1-\\frac{P'(\\boldsymbol{x}, y)}{P(\\boldsymbol{x}, y)} | $, we have\n\n$$\nerr_{\\mathcal{D}} \\approx \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\mathbb{I}[y_i \\notin \\mathcal{B}(x_i)] + \\left(\\frac{1}{m^\\prime} - \\frac{1}{m}\\right) \\sum_{i=1}^m \\mathbb{I}[y_i \\in \\mathcal{B}(x_i)] ,\n$$\nand if we aim to achieve an $ \\epsilon $ error between the generalization error and the empirical error with probability $1-\\delta $, the estimated number of training samples required can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nm \\geq \\left(\\frac{4 c_{\\Phi} N(K+1) B_{\\text{model}} + B_{\\Phi} \\sqrt{2 \\log (2 / \\delta)}}{\\epsilon - {err}_{\\mathcal{D}}}\\right)^2.\n$$\nBy further comparing this estimate with the total number of samples, we can estimate the required recall rate. It is worth noting such an estimate is typically conservative, and we still recommend using the results from the experiments.\n\n**Table 1: Model Performance on the Mind Dataset**\n\n| Recall | Accuracy | Improvement (Above 0.6500) |\n| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |\n| 16.1%       | 0.6717   | Yes                                 |\n| 25.0%       | 0.6844   | Yes                                 |\n| 36.2%       | 0.6685   | Yes                                 |\n| 49.1%       | 0.6550   | Yes                                 |\n\n**Table 2: Model Performance on the Movie Dataset**\n\n| Recall | Accuracy | Improvement (Above 0.3516) |\n| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |\n| 7.5%        | 0.2581   | No                                  |\n| 10.7%       | 0.3548   | Yes                                 |\n| 17.4%       | 0.3562   | Yes                                 |\n| 24.6%       | 0.3547   | Yes                                 |\n\n\n**Response to Weakness 3:**\n\nThank you for identifying the typos.

We fully agree that exploring retriever architectures beyond tree-based models could provide a more comprehensive understanding of two-stage recommender systems. This is a promising and broad area of research.

We also share the same view that efficiency and scalability are key considerations in practical recommender systems.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, specifically computational complexity and inference latency, which are critical concerns in practical recommender systems, our work points to the impact of the number of branches on the performance of tree-based models. While the generalization-related conclusions may not directly correlate with efficiency, we highlight that increasing the number of branches in the tree can improve model performance, but also increases the computational complexity and inference latency of the retriever. In an extreme case, when the number of branches equals the number of items, the tree structure becomes ineffective because it requires traversing all items during inference. At this point, the retriever model essentially degenerates into a ranker model, which is more precise yet more time-consuming. The number of branches can thus be viewed as a tradeoff between performance and efficiency.\n\nIn terms of scalability, the two improvement strategies derived from our theoretical analysis, increasing the number of tree branches and adjusting the training distribution of the ranker, are feasible in practice across different models. Although the conclusions may vary depending on the specific network architecture, these strategies can still provide valuable guidance for model design.'}}, 'id': 'S3leGMixmF', 'forum': 'm1a4CrRJR7', 'replyto': 'WMPIK1PPAB', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16714/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16714/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16714/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722848510699, 'cdate': 1722848510699, 'tmdate': 1730883675796, 'mdate': 1730883675796, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'This paper analyzes the generalization error of two-stage recommender systems with a tree structure, which consist of an efficient tree-based retriever and a more precise but time-consuming ranker.

The points that Reviewer Q984 make are relevant, and so we will address them in detail:\n\n## Novelty of weight averaging\n*The connections between learning rate schedules and weight averaging are well known*\n\nWe discuss this at the beginning of our introduction, quoting from our work: "".. Zamani and Glineur (2023) and Defazio et al. (2023) showed that the exact worst-case optimal rates can be achieved via carefully chosen learning rate sequences (also known as schedules) alone, without the use of averaging. This result suggests that schedules have, in some sense, the same role to play as PR averaging in optimization"". We tried to be careful to not over-claim here, we are not saying we discovered this link between averaging and schedules. Our claim is that our work is the first to give a method that uses averaging that *does not require a schedule*, while still matching or outperforming schedule-based approaches.\n\nThe work of Sandler et al 2023 doesn\'t use averaging to yield a schedule free method. They show that for stochastic quadratic models, you can achieve the convergence rate by averaging $k$ weights as you can by reducing the learning rate by a factor $k$. A quote:\n\n“Thus averaging two solutions with a higher learning rate $\\lambda$ gives us practically identical solution as if following the trajectory from $\\theta_1$ to $\\theta_2$, but with the learning rate $\\lambda/2$.”\n\nThere work is relevant and we will add a citation to our related work section, but their result is orthogonal to ours. They use averaging to replace the LR decreases in a regular schedule, but that still requires you to choose when to introduce and increase the amount of averaging, it\'s not ""schedule-free"", and the idea of the existence of schedule-free methods is not discussed in their work.\n\n\n## Schedule-Free-ness\n*The extent to which the paper is actually schedule-free is unclear*\n\nWe are running more experiments to verify this, as this is an important concern. Our theoretical results are very clear here, they explain why it\'s possible to learn without a time-dependence on the hyper-parameters. The experiments we include in the global PDF show that it may be possible to achieve a slightly higher test accuracy at the early stages of training by using less momentum, but the difference is tiny. We also show in Figure 1 in our work that a single run of Schedule-Free is competitive with runs with cosine schedules of varying lengths, which strongly supports our claim.\n\n## Falsifiable Predictions\n\n*There is no actual evidence provided for a connection between the theorems and the practical performance of the method*\n\nThis question is a difficult one to tackle, as we present a lot of empirical results to support our theory, but it\'s unclear to what degree these can be considered *falsifiable predictions*. \n\nOur work was motivated by the earlier theoretical results which suggested that averaging should be able to match schedules in performance; this could be considered the core theoretical prediction behind our work. In the introduction we state the question:\n\n""Do there exist iterate averaging approaches that match the empirical performance of learning rate schedules, without sacrificing theoretical guarantees?""\n\nThis is not quite a falsifiable prediction in the classical sense of the *scientific method*, but we do demonstrate a method that matches the theoretical behavior predicted of averaging methods; this is strong empirical and scientific evidence.\n\nOur paper also introduces a new form of momentum, which has appealing theoretical properties not satisfied by regular momentum, such as being worst-case optimal for any choice of momentum parameter. We can generally expect that a method with better worst-case bound should perform the best, and that is what we show empirically: our method out-performs classical momentum. This is in a sense a prediction of the theory that is born out in practice.\n\nWe hope reviewers will judge that our theoretical and empirical results are strong and convincing, even though we don\'t strictly follow the framework described by Reviewer Q984.\n\n--------------\n\nWe are very glad to be able to present our work to responsive and thoughtful reviewers. We hope that our comments above will be considered on their merits.'}}, 'id': 'L4vnkjCxLC', 'forum': '0XeNkkENuI', 'replyto': 'SY8G7rlwTt', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14/Authors'], 'number': 18, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723300481106, 'cdate': 1723300481106, 'tmdate': 1730891330886, 'mdate': 1730891330886, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': ""Thanks for this, and I appreciate you clarifying that we're on the same page.

Since our results include sweeps of LR, decay and momentum, without evidence that these parameters are not heavily dependent on the training run length, than we could just be ""shifting"" the need to set a duration-dependent schedule into the need to set a duration dependent LR/decay/momentum. We will run more comprehensive experiments for the camera ready demonstrating that the optimal hyper-parameters are not heavily dependent on the run duration. We will devote a section to this, as this is an important question that our work currently does not answer. This will involve sweeping each parameter at different run durations, to determine if shorter or longer runs require different hyper-parameters for optimal performance, both for schedules and for Schedule-Free learning.\n\nThese results will be interesting as we are not aware of any existing comprehensive examination of hyper-parameter dependence on training duration currently in the literature even for schedules. Thank you for this suggestion!\n\nRegarding the analysis framework, we see our approach as complementary rather than in competition with such work. In particular, theory-work that more directly addresses the properties that neural networks possess that make training tractable for them is extremely important and we follow the literature closely there. It\'s clear that there is a lot going on that is not captured by the classical smooth-non-convex analysis framework that is often used in the optimization literature. We hope that bridging this divide via reductions that apply for certain restricted problem classes (as described in the Open Problem mentioned above) will help bring us closer to developing optimization methods that better exploit the properties of neural networks.

However this is not emphasized in the paper.** I say this both in the sense that I knew them, and they are written up formally in [Sandler et al 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02312) where the authors write:\n> One practical result that we demonstrate that various popular averaging techniques have equivalent\nlearning rate schedules.\n\nI recommend looking at Figure 1 of [Sandler et al 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02312), where the authors show that a rapid learning rate decay at any point in training can give a big boost in performance to match the weight-averaged model. This can be done ""any-time"", and in my experience, many practitioners know this. From this perspective, it seems to me that Schedule-Free is likely finding a way to get the main iterates of the method to match the performance of the weight-averaged model directly, which is indeed really cool. However, the authors do not contextualize their result as such, since I think they are unaware of [Sandler et al 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02312). This connection is also present in [Hägele et al 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18392) who report that constant + cooldown schedule (basically the technique in Figure 1 of [Sandler et al 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02312)) outperforms schedule free.\n\n**The extent to which the paper is actually schedule-free is unclear** For the method to really be schedule-free, the optimal hyper parameters need to be invariant to the stopping time. Otherwise, tuning hyperparameters may implicitly be tuning a schedule. However, the authors do not really explore this. And furthermore, the experiments in the rebuttal suggest that this invariance is likely not the case. Looking at the bottom left plot, you see that the curves for different momentum values cross during training.\n\n**There is no actual evidence provided for a connection between the theorems and the practical performance of the method** Remember that in science, for a theory to be falsifiable, it should make some kind of testable prediction. I\'d like to see the authors produce a falsifiable prediction from their theory and then actually test it. Otherwise this aspect of the paper feels more like mathematical storytelling to me. I am doubtful about the usefulness of online convex optimization for analyzing deep learning algorithms.\n\nAgain, I don\'t mean to be gloomy, just I believe there should be a high bar for an award quality paper, and I invite the authors and other reviewers to respond.'}}, 'id': 'SY8G7rlwTt', 'forum': '0XeNkkENuI', 'replyto': '0XeNkkENuI', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14/Reviewer_Q984'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14/Reviewer_Q984'], 'number': 15, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723252924866, 'cdate': 1723252924866, 'tmdate': 1730891331038, 'mdate': 1730891331038, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': 'Hi---thanks for the reply!\n\n**""These evaluations are time-consuming""** Agreed and I hope I made it clear in my initial review I wasn\'t asking you to do this during the rebuttal.

There is a significant difference in scale between the problems in AlgoPerf, ranging from solving in minutes to days, but it\'s not at the level of modern large-scale training runs, as the entire benchmark suite is designed to run beginning-to-end in under a week on 8 V100 GPUS (2 generations old!). \n\nWe are also very interested in evaluations at larger scale as this is crucial for wide adoption of our method. We plan to run these evaluations over the coming months. These evaluations are time-consuming as the optimal LR values, momentum and decay for Schedule-Free differ from schedule-based runs, and so we need to run large log-spaced parameter sweeps. \n\n*""The convex framework is usually considered ill-suited to describe deep learning problems, but it leads to results that seem to work well in practice""*\n\nMost researchers in this area take a very different approach than we do. We want to elaborate on this further as it\'s central to the development of this method.\n\nIt\'s clear that non-convex deep learning problems don\'t inherit many of the nice-properties of convex problems. For example, it\'s often the case that methods that rely on estimating smoothness fail when extended naively to the deep learning setting. However, there is a growing belief in the community that the *online* convex optimization framework, which only assumes bounded gradient rather than smoothness, can accurately model the behavior of non-convex learning. This was captured in a recent COLT Open Problem submission: https://www.ehazan.com/open_problem.pdf. Any progress on this open problem, developing a theoretical black-box reduction between the two settings, would justify our method. \n\nSo as you say, we don\'t directly answer the question of why our method works in the setting of our deep learning experiments. We don\'t know how to answer this question concretely yet. It\'s wild that it works - averaging of iterates makes little sense on non-convex problems, and so some level of local convexity must be present, and seemingly far more than we would have believed before we started this line of research!

Also varying number of tokens instead of number of ImageNet epochs avoids confounding factors from doing multiple passes over the same data.

The momentum value also depends on the length of training, so does not maintain the nice properties of Schedule-Free learning. This extreme hyper-parameter sensitivity would make it very difficult to use in practice.\n - The EMA sequence requires an additional memory buffer over Schedule-Free as the base optimizer must also use it's own momentum to prevent divergence.

We think that this approach has wide applicability and we are doing our best to spur adoption by doing an open source release in both PyTorch and Jax. An entry using our method was entered into the AlgoPerf competition earlier this year, and the final results were just released this week, showing that Schedule-Free AdamW ranked **first** in the self-tuning division, beating out all other entries including the AdamW+Cosine implementation tuned by the organizers. We hope this independent verification will help you assess the potential impact of our work.\n\n# Weaknesses\n\n## Paper may be over claiming slightly on its results\n\n*""one of the largest and most comprehensive machine learning optimization algorithm evaluations”. Can you quantify in what sense this is true?*\n\nWe will reword this phrase as we agree it is not precise enough. We wanted to convey that we run experiments on a larger set of test problems than any prior paper on deep learning optimization. As far as we are aware, there is no paper out there that runs as many full-training (not fine-tuning) experiments as we do on deep learning problems. The are larger comparisons on logistic regression and other convex problems in past literature, as well as model fine-tunings, so we need to be careful to adjust our wording to clarify.\n\nWe have ran additional hyper-parameter sensitivity experiments, please see the section below.\n\n*""has no notable memory, computation or performance limitations compared to scheduling approaches""* \n\n- We will cut this phrase from the conclusion as we agree it is overreaching at the moment.\n\n## Hyper-parameter sensitivity is not thoroughly investigated\nThis is a good point, we don\'t currently investigate hyper-parameter sensitivity thoroughly. We ran a series of additional experiments and have included these results in the PDF attached to the global rebuttal. We ran as many experiments as we were able to in the 1 week rebuttal period, so they are not completely conclusive. We will run additional experiments for the camera ready.\n\n### Learning Rate\nWe ran a series of learning rate sweeps for the smaller problems in our test bench (these sweeps are time consuming to run), CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN. We see that the sensitivity to the optimal learning rate is very similar to SGD with momentum, with some variability observed. For CIFAR10/100 the curves look essentially the same, and for SVHN the curve has a somewhat tighter peak.\n\n## Momentum\nFor our momentum sweep, we see a similar result. For both problems that we ran, neither Schedule-Free or the SGD+Momentum baseline show clearly more or less sensitivity to the hyper-parameter, and there isn\'t a clear pattern.\n\n### Beta v.s. Training Time\nSee the Questions section below.\n\n## Paper applies a potentially ill-suited theoretical framework to deep learning, and as such there are gaps\nThe analysis framework to use here is a question we constantly struggle with as researchers in this area. The convex framework is usually considered ill-suited to describe deep learning problems, but it leads to results that seem to work well in practice (this paper\'s method is a great example). Averaging of iterates for general non-convex problems can\'t be analyzed as far as we are aware, since you can end up averaging between winding valleys of the parameter space and the resulting points don\'t necessarily have low loss. \n\nIn terms of the optimal values of $\\beta$, we are investigating this as followup work. So far we have a result that for stochastic quadratic problems $\\beta=0.5$ is optimal. A similar result holds for strongly convex problems although it may not be strictly optimal in that case. In other convex settings, larger $\\beta$ values than 0.5 are potentially better, but there is a dependence on the local quadratic-ness of the problem, and the more quadratic, the closer to 0.5 the value should be.\n\n## Questions:\n\n1) *do you know if beta is sensitive to e.g. training time?*\n\n We have run an additional experiment to understand this dependence for the ImageNet test problem, it is included in the global rebuttal PDF. We ran training out to 200 epochs instead of 100, to see if larger $\\beta$ values given improvements at the very late-stages of training.\n\nWe find that at the early stages of training, the value of $0.9$ gives the highest test accuracy, but at approximately epoch 50, the larger value of $0.95$ starts to dominate (we didn\'t run $0.9$ in our sweep in our paper, so this result is an improvement over the previous results). This $0.95$ value dominates for the remainder of training, and the larger value of $0.98$ is far behind in terms of test accuracy. The beta=0.75 run doesn\'t do better at the beginning, so it\'s not the case generally that smaller beta is always better at the beginning.\n\nSo to summarize, smaller $\\beta$ values can perform better for shorter duration training runs, but this dependence on training time for the optimal beta seems very mild.\n\n2) *which sequence is used to do inference x, or y, or z?* \n\nThis a good suggestion, we don\'t currently clearly indicate which sequence is used. We will update the paper. The sequence used for inference should be the $x$ iterate.\n\n\nIf you have any further questions please don\'t hesitate to ask.'}}, 'id': 'Ed9K6G941T', 'forum': '0XeNkkENuI', 'replyto': 'x2glxioLED', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722885736273, 'cdate': 1722885736273, 'tmdate': 1730880356380, 'mdate': 1730880356380, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""# Weaknesses\n\n1.\n\nThis is a really good point. It is possible to get Polyak averaging to converge by using a smaller LR value. For the IWSLT14 illustrative plot we did not include a full LR sweep (as we did with all experiments in the experiments section) when we should have. We have ran this LR sweep and included the updated plot in the global rebuttal PDF. It shows that both Polyak and Primal averaging still greatly under-perform compared to both a cosine schedule and the Schedule-Free approach.\n\nWe currently do include Polyak and Primal averaging in all convex-case experiments but we can also run these for the deep learning experiments for completeness. We will run these additional experiments for the camera ready. After reflecting on your question, we realize that there hasn't been any published experiments extensively comparing Polyak or Primal averaging to schedules in the non-convex setting, and their sub-optimality is more a folk-law result. These additional experiments could be useful to the community.\n\n2) See experimental results below.\n\n# Questions\n*Could the authors add comparison to (tuned) EMA?*\nThis turned out to be an interesting question. We ran an experiment on CIFAR-10 using SGD with momentum 0.9, using the same experimental setup as in the paper, and with warmup-then-flat learning rate schedule. \nWe found that with a careful sweep of the exponential model averaging parameter, we are able to achieve essentially the same test accuracy as we get with Schedule-Free. See below a list of EMA values and the associated test accuracies (single seed), sorted from best to worst:\n\n0.9998: 96.02\n\n0.9996 95.92\n\n0.9999: 95.83\n\n0.99996: 95.743\n\n0.998: 95.66\n\n0.999: 95.60\n\n0.99998: 95.343\n\n0.996: 95.313\n\n0.99: 94.852\n\n0.99999: 92.768\n\nThis is an interesting result! It suggests that the averaging in Schedule-Free may have a similar effect to exponential weight averaging, but without the requirement to tune an additional parameter, and also without the additional memory cost of EWA. Thank you for the suggestion that we investigate this. This link definitely warrants further investigation and we will run additional experiments for the camera ready that directly compare to EMA.\n\nWe also tried running exponential model averaging using a warmup+cosine schedule for the SGD+M method. This was significantly worse across the board than the warmup+fixed schedule, which is surprising as existing papers usually stack EMA with a schedule. See the results below:\n\n0.998 95.48\n\n0.99996 95.45\n\n0.9996 95.38\n\n0.9998 95.38\n\n0.95 95.33\n\n0.98 95.30\n\n0.999 95.292\n\n0.996 95.24\n\n0.99 95.16\n\n0.9999 95.04\n\nWhen combining with a schedule there is less sensitivity to the choice of $\\beta$.\n\nWe hope these experiments help answer your questions.

This can be seen by rearranging the equation for $x$ in the more classical EMA form: $x_{t}=\\left(1-\\alpha\\right)x_{t-1}+\\alpha z_{t,k}$.

We are very glad you see the potential of our method. We would like to start by addressing each of your concerns separately:\n\nWeaknesses: \n 1) *additional forward passes* This is a good point! In our PyTorch and Jax implementations, we are able to avoid any additional forward or backward passes over regular AdamW, except when BatchNorm is used, where the extra forward passes are needed to warmup the BN running_mean/var buffers before a test loss evaluation. These extra forward passes have less than 2% runtime overhead. Given this low overhead, and the fact that batch-norm is quickly being replaced by layer-norm and other alternatives in modern architectures, we don\'t think this is a major issue. \n\n2) *heuristic adaptation for AdamW* As you say, our Schedule-Free AdamW version is heuristically adapted from standard AdamW. We will add a section to discuss this to the paper. AdamW doesn\'t have a concrete regret bound, but related methods that ""fix"" AdamW\'s theory, such as AMSgrad, can also be used. Since our main Theorem shows how any method with a proven regret bound can be used adapted to be Schedule-Free, it is then no longer heuristic. Our theorem handles arbitrary learning rates including warmup, and any weighting sequence, so this bound directly applies to the methods as practically implemented.\n\nQuestions:\n1) *LR Adaptation* We have done some initial investigation into integrating Schedule-Free with various recently described LR adaptation methods. This integration is surprising subtle as the theory doesn\'t apply directly for the technical reason that D-Adaptation and DoG methods show bounds on the stochastic loss, NOT the regret, whereas our method specifically requires a regret bound. This difference is crucial to those methods behavior from the theory point of view. We so far have not seen good results when using Schedule-Free in combination with D-Adaptation or Prodigy. We are planning to next investigate integrating with regret-bound methods such as Mechanic and Coin-Betting approaches in the future, and we hope to see good results there.\n2) *Line 158 - Momentum allows larger LR values* In the quadratic setting, for large beta values, our method becomes convergent for larger learning rates then you would normally be able to use. This is likely related to the similarity between our method and momentum which provides acceleration in the quadratic case. However, we don\'t believe this result is indicative of the actual behavior of the method on deep learning problems as it only holds in the quadratic setting. We have further theoretical results in this direction that didn\'t make it into the paper by the submission deadline, and we see in the stochastic strongly convex case, our method provides provably better convergence rate bounds with beta \\in (0,1) than is achieved with Polyak or Primal averaging.\n\n3) *decoupled weight decay* Integration of optimization methods with decoupled weight decay is a surprisingly subtle issue. Currently we have a switch in the open source code that supports weight decay calculated either at $y$ (the default used in our experiments) and $x$. We find empirically that calculating it at $y$ performs a tiny bit better on some problems but it largely doesn\'t matter.

I\'m not going to hold the paper hostage, but if I feel like you engage meaningfully with my critiques I\'m willing to upgrade my score. All of my critiques can be addressed either by making minor amendments to text or by adding a limitations section at the end of the paper *or* by running more experiments and addressing them, but I won\'t insist on which and leave this up to the authors.\n\n### **Paper may be over claiming slightly on its results**\n\nThe paper makes claims to be **""one of the largest and most comprehensive machine learning optimization algorithm evaluations”**. Can you quantify in what sense this is true? To me the evaluation doesn\'t feel that comprehensive---for instance, there is only one plot on hyperparameter sensitivity, while a broad swathe of the community has started to explore this question as standard in evaluations papers. The authors also state their method **""has no notable memory, computation or performance limitations compared to scheduling approaches""**. In my opinion, the truth value of this statement is essentially unknowable without more thorough evaluation. It would be fine to amend the statement by saying ""WE BELIEVE THAT our method has no notable memory, computation or performance limitations compared to scheduling approaches.""\n\n### **Hyperparameter sensitivity is not thoroughly investigated**\n\nIn my opinion, the main potential limitation of the work is that tuning hyperparameters (learning rate, weight decay, interpolation constant $\\beta$) may implicitly be tuning an LR schedule. This is especially the case for this technique since the role of these hyperparameters is quite subtle given the unusual form of the update sequences. Now the authors may argue that they address this with their MLCommons Algorithmic Efficiency experiments that reportedly use the same set of hyperparameter across all tasks, but in my opinion this could be a fluke relating to all the MLCommons tasks involving similar training times for instance. What I would want to see to convince me otherwise is to see experiments that sweep across beta for different training times, and check if the optimal beta is invariant to training time, say.\n\n### **Paper applies a potentially ill-suited theoretical framework to deep learning, and as such there are gaps**\n\nThe paper comes from a part of the community that uses convex optimization frameworks to do algorithm design, and then extends the methods to deep network training. Sometimes the extension can feel a bit forced: e.g. let\'s switch to Adam instead of SGD as our base optimiser because it works better, let\'s use learning rate warmup because it works better, etc. The paper uses theorems within this convex framework to support its significance, but as far as I can tell these theorems don\'t answer basic questions a practitioner would have about the technique: e.g. Theorems 1 and 2 provided no guidance on setting the interpolation parameter $\\beta$ since they hold uniformly for all $\\beta \\in [0,1]$.\n\nI want to point out that another part of the community is trying to build up understanding and frameworks for deep learning fundamentals that involve less of a ""jump"" from convex optimisation to deep learning. To point out two examples:\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00065 ""Gradient Descent on Neural Networks Typically Occurs at the Edge of Stability""\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14813 ""Scalable Optimization in the Modular Norm"" (concurrent work)\n\nI think it would be great to at least read these works and potentially engage with them---not in this paper, but in the future\n\n### **Final note**\n\nI sometimes worry about giving frank feedback as I think I can sometimes have a blunt style. I want to re-emphasise that I really like this paper. I think the idea is clever and creative, and I really encourage you to pursue these directions further. The feedback is intended constructively.

"['Rohan Alur', 'Manish Raghavan', 'Devavrat Shah']",NeurIPS,Human Expertise in Algorithmic Prediction,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97946,2024," We introduce a novel framework for incorporating human expertise into algorithmic predictions. Our approach leverages human judgment to distinguish inputs which are algorithmically indistinguishable , or ""look the same"" to predictive algorithms.  We argue that this framing clarifies the problem of human-AI collaboration in prediction tasks, as experts often form judgments by drawing on information which is not encoded in an algorithm's training data. Algorithmic indistinguishability yields a natural test for assessing whether experts incorporate this kind of ""side information"", and further provides a simple but principled method for selectively incorporating human feedback into algorithmic predictions. We show that this method provably improves the performance of any feasible algorithmic predictor and precisely quantify this improvement.  We find empirically that although algorithms often outperform their human counterparts on average , human judgment can improve algorithmic predictions on specific instances (which can be identified ex-ante). In an X-ray classification task, we find that this subset constitutes nearly 30% of the patient population. Our approach provides a natural way of uncovering this heterogeneity and thus enabling effective human-AI collaboration.",Oral Session 1B: Human-AI Interaction,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=wpGJ2AX6SZ,https://openreview.net/forum?id=wpGJ2AX6SZ,wpGJ2AX6SZ,"[{'content': {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your comment.

We agree that these definitions could use a bit more exposition; we will add more background and provide a concrete interpretation in the context of diagnosing atelectasis (which is described earlier in the introduction) to make them more accessible.\n\n**In response to:** *This reader is not succeeding in following the argument about robustness (section 6).*\n\nWe agree that this portion of the manuscript could be more accessible. We will add some additional exposition to section 6 and further clarify the intended application of these results. To motivate this section, it is helpful to consider the following stylized example:\n\nSuppose we are interested in designing an algorithmic risk score for a large hospital system. As discussed in section 6, one important consideration is that doctors at this hospital system may only selectively comply with the algorithm. Concretely, suppose there is one doctor, doctor A, who generally complies with the algorithm\'s recommendations except on patients who have high blood pressure; the doctor believes (correctly or not) that the algorithm underweights high blood pressure as a risk factor, and simply uses their judgment to make decisions for this subset of patients. A second doctor, doctor B, similarly complies with the algorithm on all patients under the age of 65, but ignores its recommendations for patients 65 and older.\n\nWhat does an optimal algorithm look like? For doctor A, we would like to select the algorithm which minimizes error on patients who do not have high blood pressure, as these are the patients for whom the doctor actually uses the algorithm\'s recommendations. Similarly, for doctor B, we would like to select the algorithm which minimizes error on patients who are under 65. The key thing to note is that there is no guarantee that these are the same algorithm: if we were to run empirical risk minimization over the first population of patients, we might get a different predictor than if we ran empirical risk minimization over the second population. This is of course not just a finite sample problem; it is also possible that, given any restricted model class (e.g., all linear predictors), the optimal predictor for one subpopulation may not be optimal for a different subpopulation.\n\nFor both practical and ethical reasons, we cannot provide individualized risk scores for every physician; we must provide a single risk predictor for the entire hospital system. Our first result (Lemma A.4) shows that, without further assumptions, this is an intractable problem. If there are arbitrarily many physicians who may choose to comply in arbitrary ways, then we need a predictor which is simultaneously optimal for every possible patient subpopulation. The only predictor which satisfies this criterion is the Bayes optimal predictor, which is infeasible to learn in a finite data regime.\n\nHowever, it is perhaps more likely that physicians decide whether or not to defer to the algorithm using relatively simple heuristics. If we believe we can model these heuristics as a ""simple"" function of observable patient characteristics --- e.g., that all compliance patterns can be expressed as a shallow decision tree, even if particular compliance behavior varies across physicians --- then perhaps we can leverage this structure to design a single optimal predictor. Theorem 6.1 shows that indeed this is possible: if a predictor is multicalibrated over the appropriate class of risk scores and compliance patterns, then, for every physician, on the subpopulation of patients that the physician defers to the algorithm, the performance of the multicalibrated predictor is competitive with that of any other predictor in the class ${\\cal F}$. Thus, by leveraging known or assumed structure in user compliance patterns, we can design predictors which are ""robust"" to those compliance patterns.\n\nWe hope that helps clarify the motivation and intended application of the results in section 6. As mentioned above, we will update our manuscript to make this section more accessible, and would be happy to answer any follow up questions during the upcoming discussion period.\n    \n**In response to:** *The case studies are retrospective so both machine and human outcomes are available to use in the analysis. How would the approach work in a live situation?*\n\nThis is an excellent question, and one which we will address in more detail (particularly in the discussion section). On a forward-looking basis, perhaps the most natural application of our framework is to proactively solicit expert feedback on *only* those inputs where it appears to provide additional information. For example, in section 4, we observe that a nonzero coefficient $\\beta_k^*$ indicates that an expert provides additional signal within subset $S_k$, whereas a coefficient of $0$ indicates the opposite. Thus, although we assume that we have retrospective expert predictions for every instance, we could prospectively focus expert attention on only the subset of instances where experts add value and simply defer the remainder to an algorithm.\n\nMore generally, choices for both *whether* to solicit expert feedback and *how* to incorporate that feedback into forward-looking decisions is a substantial topic in its own right. For example, translating predictions to decisions, and deciding whether to incorporate expert feedback to do so, may require a rich model of decision makers\' preferences or utility functions. We discuss these at length in our response to reviewers fseb and XFzN. Furthermore, although we focus on the standard ""batch"" supervised learning setting to highlight our main contributions, we view the extension to an online learning context as a promising avenue for future work, and will include it in our discussion of open problems in section 7.'}}, 'id': 'zZwbhgRAEW', 'forum': 'wpGJ2AX6SZ', 'replyto': 'YxNisJxtJ3', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18035/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18035/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18035/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722956841458, 'cdate': 1722956841458, 'tmdate': 1730883892420, 'mdate': 1730883892420, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': '**In response to:** *The paper would be even more satisfying if the method is presented as a framework rather than a specific instantiation...* And: *My main comment is that the authors should comment more about the future work and implications of this method.*\n\nThank you for your feedback, we agree that we could devote more space to discussing the generality of our approach and avenues for possible future work. We provide our thoughts on this point below, and will plan to update our manuscript to better communicate the scope of indistinguishability beyond minimizing mean squared error (this is closely related to reviewer fseb\'s question about modeling decision makers which richer preferences; for convenience, we copy our response under both reviewers comments).\n    \nOne way of interpreting algorithmic indistinguishability is that the algorithm provides the decision maker with a partial ordering over instances, where the ordering is defined with respect to a single outcome of interest $Y$. In particular, the algorithm can assert that instances in one indistinguishable subset $S_1$ have a larger average value of $Y$ than another indistinguishable subset $S_2$ --- so the algorithm implicitly ranks each $x \\in S_1$ higher than each $x \\in S_2$ --- but it has no way of ordering instances *within* each indistinguishable subset. Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.2 focus on settings where the objective of interest is to minimize mean squared error, and show how additional information provided by the expert can be used in service of this objective. However, this is far from the only possibility: for example, a decision maker might use predictions to inform a selection rule which seeks to balance both maximizing the mean value of $Y$ within the pool selected while also ensuring some measure of fairness or diversity (e.g., a university choosing which students to accept, where $Y$ is some measure of academic performance). In this setting, a very natural application of our framework would be to present the decision maker with a set of inputs which are algorithmically indistinguishable with respect to $Y$, and allow the decision maker to then choose from this pool to maximize their chosen fairness metric (e.g., by choosing a set of candidates with diverse interests from within a pool which cannot be distinguished on the basis of predicted academic performance). Similarly, a decision maker whose utility function includes some measure of risk aversion may select a pool of candidates from within an indistinguishable subset to minimize e.g., the *variance* of $Y$ among those selected. In both cases, indistinguishability provides a principled basis for imposing ""secondary"" preferences in decision making, as the decision maker can reasonably assert that they otherwise lack information to distinguish instances on the basis of (the expected value of) $Y$ alone.\n\nFinally, we note that in both of these examples, we did not assume that the decision maker\'s utility can be linearly decomposed across inputs. This is in contrast to mean squared error, which can be decomposed as a (normalized) *sum* of prediction errors accross inputs. For example, a measure of fairness might depend on the composition of the entire group selected; it may not always make sense to ask whether the selection of a single individual in isolation is ""fair"". Similarly, a measure of risk might also depend on the composition of the entire group which is selected; perhaps the decision maker wants to select a set of inputs whose outcomes are minimally correlated (e.g., choosing a portfolio of stocks), and thus their utility is again necessarily a set-valued function.  Thus, our framework is not restricted to minimizing mean squared error or simple variants thereof; instead, it provides a substantially more general basis for decision making under uncertainty. Modeling a decision maker with richer preferences is a fascinating direction, and would be happy to address any followup questions or comments during the upcoming discussion period. \n\n    \n**In response to:** *Furthermore, I would be interested to hear what the authors think about a related paper [1], and how these papers might be related. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00694*\n\nThank you for the pointer to this work. This is a fascinating and related topic, which characterizes the value of human expertise as an inductive bias for guiding model selection. In particular, the authors argue that expert decisions regarding treatment allocation can be highly predictive of the true treatment effects, and that this fact can be used to inform the model selection process for treatment effect estimation. Importantly however --- and as is typical in treatment effect estimation problems --- [1] assumes *no hidden confounding* (see Section 2), which rules out the possibility that experts leverage information which is correlated with potential outcomes but unavailable to the algorithm.\n    \nThis perspective is complementary to our work, which is instead focused on the possibility that experts *do* have information which is unavailable to the algorithm, and studies how to incorporate this information at ""inference"" or ""test"" time. Thus, even given infinite data to learn the best possible (e.g., Bayes optimal) model of $Y$ given $X$, our method might incorporate expert feedback at test time to improve predictions. In contrast, [1] uses expert decisions at training time to more efficiently learn a model under sample size constraints, but do not consider incorporating expertise at test time because it is assumed that experts do not provide signal which the algorithm could not (eventually, given sufficient training data, and under the overlap and unconfoundedness assumptions) learn on its own. \n\nWe thank you for pointing us to this work, and we will include a citation in our manuscript.

Although binary choices are simple and widely used, they provide limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which are inversely related to preference strength, as an additional signal. We propose a computationally efficient method that combines choices and response times to estimate human utility functions, grounded in the EZ diffusion model from psychology. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that for queries with strong preferences, response times complement choices by providing extra information about preference strength, leading to significantly improved utility estimation. We incorporate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification.

New Simulation on a Real-world dataset\nWe present new simulation results based on another real-world response time dataset. This dataset [1] contains human binary choices and response times. In each query, each arm consists of two food items, and the human has an equal chance of obtaining either item after choosing that arm. For each user, we construct a bandit instance where the feature vector for each arm is composed of the user's ratings of the food items, augmented via second-order polynomials. For each user, an EZ-DDM is identified via Bayesian MCMC and then used as a simulator to generate human feedback. We compare the best-arm-identification errors over $100$ repetitions for three algorithms:\n1. Transductive design with our choice-and-response-time estimator, denoted by $\\left(\\lambda\\_{trans},\\widehat{\\theta}\\_{CH,DT}\\right)$.\n2. Transductive design with a choice-only estimator, denoted by $\\left(\\lambda\\_{trans},\\widehat{\\theta}\\_{CH}\\right)$.\n3. Hard-query design with a choice-only estimator, denoted by $\\left(\\lambda\\_{hard},\\widehat{\\theta}\\_{CH}\\right)$.\n\nThe results are plotted in Fig. 1 of our rebuttal PDF document. As shown, under various budgets and participant indices, incorporating response times (method (1), plotted in red) outperformed the other two methods.\n\n\n## 2. New Non-asymptotic Analysis\nWe added lemmas stating non-asymptotic error probabilities on estimating the utility difference $x^{\\top}\\theta^*/a$ using both methods, i.e. combining response times with choices and using choices only. The results convey the same intuition as in the Thm. 3.1 and 3.2 in our draft:\n\n*Response times make easy queries more useful. In other words, combining response times and choices, information from easy queries can be extracted more efficiently. This is not possible using choices only.*\n\nWe analyzed the non-asymptotic concentration for the utility difference estimated as the ratio between the empirical mean of choices and the empirical mean of response times, which appears on the right-hand side of Eq. 4 in our paper draft.\nThe error probability for such choice-and-response-time estimator is as follows:\n\n**Lemma 1.** Consider any query $x\\in\\mathcal{X}$. For any scalar $\\epsilon_r$ satisfying\n\\begin{equation}\\begin{split}\n    \\epsilon_r \\leq \\min\\left\\\\{\\frac{x^{\\top}\\theta^*}{\\sqrt{2}a}, \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})ax^{\\top}\\theta^*}{\\mathbb{E}[t_x]}\\right\\\\}\n\\end{split}\\end{equation}\nwe have that\n\\begin{equation}\\begin{split}\n    \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\left|\\frac{\\sum_{i\\in[n_x]} c_{x,i}}{\\sum_{i\\in[n_x]} t_{x,i}} - \\frac{x^{\\top}\\theta^*}{a}\\right| > \\epsilon_r\\right)\\leq 4\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\left(\\mathbb{E}[t_x]/(\\sqrt{2}+2)\\right)^2}{2} n_x\\epsilon_r^2\\right).\n\\end{split}\\end{equation}\n\n\nAlternatively, utility difference (or DDM drift) can be estimated using choices only (Eq. 5 in [1]). Converting $\\mathbb{E}[c_x]\\in[-1,1]$ to $\\mathbb{E}[(c_x+1)/2]\\in[0,1]$ and applying the logit function $h^{-1}(p)\\colon=\\text{logit}(p)=\\log\\left(p/(1-p)\\right)$ estimates $2ax^{\\top}\\theta^*$.\nThe error probability for such choice-only estimator is as follows:\n\n**Lemma 2.** Consider any query $x\\in\\mathcal{X}$. We have that\n\\begin{equation}\\begin{split}\n    \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{h^{-1}\\left(\\mathbb{E}[(c_x+1)/2]\\right)}{2a^2}-\\frac{x^{\\top}\\theta^*}{a} > \\epsilon_r\\right) \\leq \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\left(4a^2h'(2ax^{\\top}\\theta^*)\\right)^2}{2}n_x\\epsilon_r^2\\right).\n\\end{split}\\end{equation}\nHere $h(x) = 1/\\left(1+\\exp(-x)\\right)$.\n\nFor easy queries with $x^{\\top}\\theta^* \\gg 1$, the factor $4a^2h'(2ax^\\top\\theta^*)$ in Lemma 2 is significantly smaller than factor $\\mathbb{E}[t_x]/(\\sqrt{2}+2)$ in Lemma 1. As a result, with $x^{\\top}\\theta^*\\gg 1$, error probability of our estimation with both response times and choices is much smaller than that of the choice-only estimation.\n\nThe aforementioned two factors are plotted as functions of the utility difference $x^{\\top}\\theta^*$ in Fig. 2 of our rebuttal PDF document. Recall that this plot of non-asymptotic results looks similar to Fig. 2 (asymptotic results) in our paper draft. Indeed, they convey similar insights. In particular, When the human conservative parameter $a$ is small, for hard queries, the gray curve is slightly higher than the orange one, indicating that only using choices is slightly better. When $a$ is large, the gray curve is higher only for hard queries, while lower for easy queries. This conveys a similar insight as our Thm. 3.1 and 3.2, that using choice is better for hard queries, while using response time makes easy queries more useful.\n\n\n- [[1] Wagenmakers et al. 2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/bf03194023)""}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/97bb677949576d16f91b0d6f4d3a1b133dd86e04.pdf'}}, 'id': 'MTKBloovwv', 'forum': 'aIPwlkdOut', 'replyto': 'aIPwlkdOut', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/-/Author_Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723016663106, 'cdate': 1723016663106, 'tmdate': 1730888367366, 'mdate': 1730888367366, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""Thank you for your detailed and thoughtful review, and for recognizing the novelty and clarity of our work.\n\n## Weakness: algorithm analysis\nIn our paper draft, we provide asymptotic theoretical results to show the following intuition on why response time can improve the learning performance:\n\n*Combining response times  and choices, information from easy queries can be extracted more efficiently.

Based on our empirical results, it seems that incorporating response times, if not improving the performance, rarely degrades performance.\n2. Our theoretical and empirical results indicate that when queries are very difficult for humans to answer, incorporating response times may be less beneficial and could slightly decrease performance. However, in these scenarios, humans typically don’t have strong preferences, so they might be more tolerant of the minor performance impact caused by using response times.\n\nAlternatively, one can first incorporate response times to filter out many suboptimal options, and then use choice-only estimation for further learning. In the first stage, both good and bad arms exist. In this case, many queries, composed of one good arm and one bad arm, are easy and response times help extract more information from those easy queries. In the second stage, most arms will be similarly good. In this case, the queries are harder and choice-only estimation is sufficient to identify the best arm. Determining the optimal point to switch from using response times to relying solely on choices is an area for future research.""}}, 'id': 'MeAR2MhuVk', 'forum': 'aIPwlkdOut', 'replyto': '6GmAOb6zws', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723012091731, 'cdate': 1723012091731, 'tmdate': 1730882903520, 'mdate': 1730882903520, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""Thank you for your positive and constructive review; we appreciate your feedback and recognition of our work's novelty and usefulness.\n\n## Weakness: real-world empirical result\nWe acknowledge the importance of using real-world data for evaluation. Below is the rationale behind our simulator-based study and additional results using a different human dataset, as detailed in the `Author Rebuttal` section.\n\nFirstly, our bandit algorithm is an online algorithm, requiring us to sample response times of different queries online adaptively. Existing offline datasets are not collected adaptively, and is hard to be used for evaluating our algorithm. Although, there exist offline policy evaluation methods[2] that evaluate online algorithms with offline data, they require extensive data from a single user. Unfortunately, we have not been able to find such large-scaled datasets for response times.\n\nSecondly, online collecting response time data can suffer from outliers due to human inattention or anticipation [1]. Successful studies may require integrating data cleansing techniques [1] into online algorithms, which we consider as a separate contribution in future work.\n\nTherefore, in our work, we adopt a third approach: training a simulator from real-world data and then using the simulator to evaluate algorithms. This approach assumes that the EZ-DDM is the ground truth model, which is a reasonable assumption given the empirical support for this model [3]. We believe this approach justifies our insights—using response times makes easy queries more useful—while leaving a full user study for future work.\n\nWe have included a new simulation-based study using another dataset of human choices and response times in the `Author Rebuttal` section. This study confirms that incorporating response times improves best-arm identification performance.\n\n- [[1] Myers et al. 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1039172/full)\n- [[2] Li et al. 2010](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1772690.1772758?casa_token=RuMgk8seZScAAAAA:YyJgdyVIfKDBquZ8uuDO-RAg3kK3vVmu-3Drco_J8CCUxYJXGgg2TCUepSwV6UvWqU4hYbpNwDTbVg)\n- [[3] Wagenmakers et al. 2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/bf03194023)\n\n## Question: about lapses and data processing\nIn general, there are two types of lapses: 1) lapses at the very beginning of the decision process; 2) lapses, or distractions, in the middle of the decision process. The first type of lapse can be interpreted as the non-decision time in the EZ-DDM model. The appendix includes our discussions about the issue of unknown non-decision times. Future work could involve estimating non-decision times from data.\n\nThe second type of lapse occurs when humans lose attention or get distracted during the decision process, resulting in very long response times. Alternatively, humans might anticipate the current trial based on previous trials, leading to very short response times [2]. To handle such outliers in real-world datasets, a common procedure is to define cut-off thresholds to eliminate very short and very long response times [2]. Additionally, human attention can be monitored using eye-tracking devices. There is a line of psychological literature [1] that tracks human eye gazes during decision-making and incorporates human visual attention within the DDM framework.\n\nAnother important procedure for handling real-world response time data is to test whether DDM is an appropriate model for a given dataset. There is literature on statistically testing whether observed response time data is generated by DDM [3][4].\n\n- [[1] Krajbich 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352250X18301866)\n- [[2] Myers et al. 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1039172/full)\n- [[3] Alós-Ferrer et al. 2021](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/713732)\n- [[4] Fudenberg et al. 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2011446117)""}}, 'id': 'mQEX2SVTrz', 'forum': 'aIPwlkdOut', 'replyto': 'hAOysYOfOi', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723011689032, 'cdate': 1723011689032, 'tmdate': 1730882903759, 'mdate': 1730882903759, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thank you for your detailed and positive review. We appreciate your constructive feedback and are glad you enjoyed the paper. We will reorganize the theoretical sections and figure presentation as suggested.\n\n## Weakness: about EZ-DDM vs DDM and EZ-DDM\'s assumptions\nThank you for pointing out the distinction between DDM and EZ-DDM [1]. We will ensure that our language in the paper accurately reflects this difference. Our work indeed adopts the assumptions of EZ-DDM, including deterministic starting points (zero-valued), drift, and non-decision time. Lifting these assumptions within the bandit framework could be a fruitful direction for future research.\n\nAs mentioned, our work assumes known non-decision time for simplicity. We appreciate your reference to EZ-DDM\'s procedure for estimating non-decision time (Eq.9 of [1]), and we agree that integrating this method with our approach is a promising avenue for future work. One reason we have not yet incorporated this method is that the estimation procedures in [1] and [2] treat each query’s non-decision time separately. In contrast, our work, following [3], assumes a common non-decision time across all queries. A potential future direction is to aggregate data across queries via the common non-decision time, similar to how we aggregate data in our current draft via the linear utility structure.\n\nTo compare our estimator with those in [1], consider the estimation of the drift $u_x$ for a query $x$. Our choice-and-response-time estimator (Eq. 4 in our draft) becomes the ratio of the expected choice and the expected response time. In contrast, [1]\'s estimator (Eq. 5 in [1]) is based solely on the choices\' log-odds, $\\log\\left(\\mathbb{P}(c_x=1)/(1-\\mathbb{P}(c_x=1))\\right)$. As our non-asymptotic analysis in `Author Rebuttal` indicates, our estimator can perform better for easy queries, while the choice-based estimator may be more effective for hard queries. When the utilities are parameterized linearly, our choice-and-response-time estimator is Eq. 4 in our paper draft, whereas [1]\'s estimator becomes Eq. 5 in our paper draft. Our asymptotic analysis in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 again highlights that using response times can be beneficial for easy queries.\n\n- [1] [Wagenmakers et al. 2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03194023)\n- [2] [Berlinghieri et al. 2023](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf1665)\n- [3] [Clithero (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268118300398})\n\n## Question: why choice-only could perform better asymptotically?\nGiven some arm $y\\in\\mathcal{Z}$, we use asymptotic variance to measure how much the estimated utility $y^T\\widehat{\\theta}$ varies around the true utility value $y^T\\theta^*$ when the sample size is very large. Our goal is to compare the asymptotic variance of the choice-response-time estimator to that of the choice-only estimator.\n\nBoth estimators\' asymptotic variances depend on how much information the estimator retain from the data, i.e. human responses to queries $x\\in \\mathcal{X}\\_{sample}$.\nThe choice-response-time estimator and the choice-only estimator retain different aspects of information from $x$. Intuitively, choices retain the ""sign"" of the utility difference $x^T\\theta^*$, while response times retain the preference strength. The ""amount"" of information they retained is formally presented as the weights $\\mathcal{M}\\_{CH,DT}$ and $m_{CH}$ in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. Higher values of these terms indicate more retained information, leading to lower variance and better estimation.\n\nWe compare the weights $\\mathcal{M}\\_{CH,DT}$ and $m_{CH}$ in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2. The choice-only estimator assigns each query $x$ a weight $m_{CH}(x^T\\theta^*)$, represented by the gray curve in Figure 2. In contrast, the choice-response-time estimator assigns all queries the same weight $\\mathcal{M}\\_{CH,DT}\\coloneqq\\min_{x}m_{CH,DT}(x^T\\theta^*)$, with $m_{CH,DT}(x^T\\theta^*)$ plotted as the orange curve in Figure 2.\n\nWhile the orange curve is consistently higher than the gray curve, indicating that $m_{CH,DT}(x^T\\theta^*)>m_{CH}(x^T\\theta^*)$ for each query $x$, the choice-response-time estimator\'s weight is $\\mathcal{M}\\_{CH,DT}$, not $m_{CH,DT}(x^T\\theta^*)$. Consequently, $\\mathcal{M}\\_{CH,DT}$ may be larger or smaller than $m_{CH}(x^T\\theta^*)$ depending on the queries in the data.\nFor instance, if the data contains both hard queries where $x^T\\theta^*\\in[-1,1]$ and one easy query where $x^T\\theta^*=4$, the choice-response-time estimator will have small weights for all queries due to the ""min"" in the definition of $\\mathcal{M}\\_{CH,DT}$, while the choice-only estimator will have large weights for hard queries even if the easy query exists. In this scenario, the choice-only estimator may perform better. Conversely, if the data only contain easy queries, the choice-response-time estimator will have a larger weight, making it superior.\n\nFinally, we would like to note that the ""min"" in the definition of $\\mathcal{M}\\_{CH,DT}$ is a result of our proof techniques. It is possible to obtain tighter theoretical analysis, and we leave it for future work.'}}, 'id': 'Q8ZWiKmmJX', 'forum': 'aIPwlkdOut', 'replyto': 'nsIj9bym77', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723010804595, 'cdate': 1723010804595, 'tmdate': 1730882904043, 'mdate': 1730882904043, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thank you for your detailed and thoughtful review. We appreciate your recognition of the novelty of our work and positive feedback on the writing. Here are our responses to your concerns and questions:\n\n## Weakness: non-asymptotic result\nIn our paper draft, we provide asymptotic theoretical results to show the following intuition on why response time can improve the learning performance:\n\n*Combining response times  and choices, information from easy queries can be extracted more efficiently. This is not possible using choices only.*\n\nWe added non-asymptotic error probability on estimating reward $x^{\\top}\\theta^*/a$ for every query $x$ using both methods, i.e. combining response times with choices and using choices only. Similar intuition can be confirmed as is shown in the `Author Rebuttal\' section.\n\nWe leave for future work to provide non-asymptotic error probability for the entire algorithm (Algoithm 1 in the paper).\n\n## Weakness: real-world empirical result\nWe included a new simulation study based on another dataset of human choices and response times in the `Author Rebuttal` section. This study shows that incorporating response times improves best-arm identification performance.\n\n## Weakness+question: background of DDM models\nWe plan to include the following summary of DDM literature in the appendix:\n\n#### 1. Literature on modeling choices and response times\nBounded accumulation models (BAMs) capture the human decision-making process with an accumulator and a stopping rule. For binary choices, DDM [1] models the human\'s speed-accuracy trade-off with one accumulator, fixed barriers, random starting points, drift, and non-decision times. Our paper adopts EZ-DDM [3], a simplified version with deterministic parameters.\nDDM with time-decaying barriers theoretically connects to human Bayesian RL models [5].\nDDMs also characterize human attention during decision-making, by modeling choices, response times, and eye gazes on options or attributes [7].\nRace models [4] extends to queries with more than two options by assuming an accumulator for each option and stopping when any accumulator reaches its threshold.\nNeurophysiological evidence supports BAMs. EEG recordings show neurons exhibit accumulation processes and decision thresholds [2][6].\n\n\n#### 2. Literature on using response times (survey [10])\nResponse times improve choice prediction. [8] showed the full DDM predicts choice probabilities better than the logit model. [9] proved that response times could enhance the identifiability of human preferences, compared to choices alone.\n\nAnother application of response times is enhancing AI agents\' decision-making. Dueling bandits and preference-based RL [14] typically use human choice models for preference elicitation. One popular choice model, the random utility model, can be derived from certain BAMs [9]. For example, both the Bradley-Terry model and EZ-DDM yield logistic choice probabilities (Eq.1 in our paper). To the best of our knowledge, **our work** is the first to leverage this connection to integrate BAMs within the framework of bandits (and RL). Note that our work lets the AI agent use RL to make decisions, which is different from [13] which models the human as an RL agent.\n\n- [[1] Ratcliff and McKoon 2008](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6796810)\n- [[2] Webb 2019](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2931)\n- [[3] Wagenmakers et al. 2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/bf03194023)\n- [[4] Usher and McClelland 2001](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2001-07628-003)\n- [[5] Fudenberg et al. 2018](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150742)\n- [[6] Ratcliff et al. 2016](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(16)00025-5)\n- [[7] Krajbich 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352250X18301866)\n- [[8] Clithero 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268118300398)\n- [[9] Alós-Ferrer et al. 2019](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/713732)\n- [[10] Clithero 2018.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167487016306444)\n- [[13] Pedersen et al. 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1199-y)\n- [[14] Bengs et al. 2021](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume22/18-546/18-546.pdf)\n\n## Question: about other link functions that models human choices\nFirst, the EZ-DDM model\'s marginal distribution for choices (Eq.1 in our draft) coincides with the Bradley-Terry model. Therefore, we have adopted the logistic link function to form a fair comparison.\n\nSecond, let\'s explore beyond the logistic link function. Suppose that the choice probability $\\mathbb{P}[z_1\\succ z_2]=\\sigma(u_{z_1},u_{z_2})$, where $\\sigma$ is a link function depending on the utilities $u_{z_1}$ and $u_{z_2}$. If we fix $u_{z_2}$ and only vary $u_{z_1}$, the function $\\sigma(\\cdot,u_{z_2})$ is known as a psychometric function, typically ""S"" shaped (see Fig.1.1 in [2]). This ""S"" shape means that as the human\'s preference strength becomes very large or very small, $\\sigma(\\cdot,u_{z_2})$ becomes flat and less informative, as you mentioned. In these circumstances, response times can be very helpful.\n\nLastly, if we further assume that $\\sigma$ depends only on the utility difference, $u_{z_1}-u_{z_2}$, this $\\sigma$ becomes the link function commonly adopted in the preference learning literature. According to Sec.3.2 of [1], the usual assumptions are that $\\sigma$ is strictly monotone in $(u_{z_1}-u_{z_2})$ and bounded within $[0, 1]$. Thus, as the utility difference becomes very large or very small, $\\sigma(u_{z_1}-u_{z_2})$ becomes flat, so the same intuition holds.\n\n- [[1] Bengs et al. 2021](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume22/18-546/18-546.pdf)\n- [[2] Stochastic Choice Theory, Econometric Society Monograph](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/tomasz/files/manuscript_01.pdf)'}}, 'id': 'sdwesGC9vX', 'forum': 'aIPwlkdOut', 'replyto': '3aFt6Omqkb', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12882/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723006992878, 'cdate': 1723006992878, 'tmdate': 1730882904077, 'mdate': 1730882904077, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'This paper studies whether leveraging human response times can lead to better performance in bandit learning from preference feedback.

Although binary choices are simple and widely used, they provide limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which are inversely related to preference strength, as an additional signal. We propose a computationally efficient method that combines choices and response times to estimate human utility functions, grounded in the EZ diffusion model from psychology. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that for queries with strong preferences, response times complement choices by providing extra information about preference strength, leading to significantly improved utility estimation.

"['Jayden Teoh', 'Wenjun Li', 'Pradeep Varakantham']",NeurIPS,Improving Environment Novelty Quantification for Effective Unsupervised Environment Design,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97974,2024," Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) formalizes the problem of autocurricula through interactive training between a teacher agent and a student agent. The teacher generates new training environments with high learning potential, curating an adaptive curriculum that strengthens the student's ability to handle unseen scenarios. Existing UED methods mainly rely on regret , a metric that measures the difference between the agent's optimal and actual performance, to guide curriculum design. Regret-driven methods generate curricula that progressively increase environment complexity for the student but overlook environment novelty — a critical element for enhancing an agent's generalizability. Measuring environment novelty is especially challenging due to the underspecified nature of environment parameters in UED, and existing approaches face significant limitations. To address this, this paper introduces the Coverage-based Evaluation of Novelty In Environment (CENIE) framework. CENIE proposes a scalable, domain-agnostic, and curriculum-aware approach to quantifying environment novelty by leveraging the student's state-action space coverage from previous curriculum experiences. We then propose an implementation of CENIE that models this coverage and measures environment novelty using Gaussian Mixture Models. By integrating both regret and novelty as complementary objectives for curriculum design, CENIE facilitates effective exploration across the state-action space while progressively increasing curriculum complexity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that augmenting existing regret-based UED algorithms with CENIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of novelty-driven autocurricula for robust generalization.",Oral Session 2B: Reinforcement Learning,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=UdxpjKO2F9,https://openreview.net/forum?id=UdxpjKO2F9,UdxpjKO2F9,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'This paper introduces an algorithm for exploring environment spaces efficiently based on a new novelty metric. \nThe authors provide compelling experimental results across a range of environments and were also able to address the concerns of the reviewers through the rebuttal phase. \nThis resulted in a number of score increases and an strong consensus that the paper should be accepted. \nGiven the relevance of the work I believe it would be great for this work to be highlighted as an oral at the conference.'}}, 'id': 'F6b9d6X5Nc', 'forum': 'UdxpjKO2F9', 'replyto': 'UdxpjKO2F9', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Program_Chairs'], 'nonreaders': [], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Program_Chairs'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/-/Decision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1727277672936, 'cdate': 1727277672936, 'tmdate': 1730886013762, 'mdate': 1730886013762, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': 'Thank you Reviewer jT1H'}, 'comment': {'value': 'It has been a pleasure engaging with you during this discussion phase.

Naively the thing to do would be to effectively frame stack to get an augmented state space. Are there other ways?**\n\nA: There is active research regarding incorporating temporal information between states. Frame-stacking as you mentioned, is a simple method to incorporate temporal information for pixel environments. Other general methods would be to include recurrent or attention layers. For more specific hierarchical RL methods, temporal abstractions via decomposing sequences into simpler sub-tasks and operating over different temporal scales can be considered.\n\n**Q: Relatedly, the policy\'s representation does not have to be the same as GENIE\'s, right?

Our use of the word ""order"" in different contexts can admittedly be confusing, but we appreciate the opportunity to clarify. In Lines 184-187, we expressed a key strength of GENIE being its prioritization of diversity in individual induced experiences of the environment, independent of the order in which they are presented. In this context, ""order"" is **intra**-environment and refers to the **sequence of experiences (state-action pairs)** presented by a **single environment**. \n\nFor our previous response regarding the differences in ACCEL and PLR, we were talking about ""order"" in the **inter**-environment context, more specifically how the **UED algorithm\'s teacher** presents the **sequence of environments** (i.e. the curriculum). GENIE enhances the diversity of individual experiences throughout all the environments in the entire curriculum but the sequence in which these diverse environments is presented in the curriculum depends on the underlying algorithm. The reason why ACCEL performs better than PLR is because the former\'s bootstraps its curriculum with simple levels (e.g. empty mazes) and gradually increases in complexity via minor mutations but the latter simply uses domain-randomized levels throughout. \n\nWe hope the above clarifies the confusion.

The following clarifications will hopefully address your concerns and strengthen the case for our paper:\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n**Q: While the focus on unordered transition tuples is mentioned as a benefit, I would think that there are certain environments where the temporal nature of trajectories are important. Could you comment on this please?**\n\nA: Revieiwer kpCs brought up the same point and we have answered it above (see question 1 in discussion with Revieiwer kpCs). TL;DR: agree and GENIE\'s design choice on prioritising individual transition tuples is flexible to accommodate non-Markovian states.\n\n**Q: Minor: 1. Line 88, for minimax one also often cites [1]; 2. The $\\tau$\'s beneath the max/expectation in equation (1) don\'t have the A and P superscripts.**\n\nA: Appreciate the sharp eye, we have revised this.\n\n### Questions\n\n**Q: Algorithm 1, please indicate what the blue text means (I assume changes to ACCEL but being clear on this would be helpful.)**\n\nA: Thank you, we have made this clearer in the revised manuscript.\n\n**Q: Please provide aggregate results averaged over all of the minigrid eval. levels. It is hard at a glance to see how the algorithms compare.**\n\nA: Figure 4a is what you are looking for. The IQM and Optimality Gap are metrics introduced by the rliable library (Agarwal et al., 2021) used for fair aggregation of performances across different tasks (levels) and comparing the performance of algorithms.\n\n**Q: Do the GENIE generated levels actually look more diverse than those generated by e.g. ACCEL? Please show a sampling of levels.**\n\nA: Answered in our global rebuttal. The sections ""GENIE Introduces Level Complexity"", ""Low Regret but High Novelty Levels Provide Interesting Experiences"" and their accompanying plots visually demonstrates the diversity of the levels generated by GENIE.\n\n\n**Q: In table 1, PLR-GENIE has the most state-action coverage, but performs much worse than the ACCEL-based methods. This seems to contradict the claim that the increased diversity is causing better performance. Could you explain this please?**\n\nA: It is important to note that there are fundamental differences in the curriculum generation mechanisms of ACCEL and PLR outside of GENIE\'s control. ACCEL mechanism initiates the curriculum with ""easy"" levels (e.g. a Minigrid with no walls and only the goal) and leverages minor edits (mutation) to gradually introduce complexity to the levels. In contrast, PLR relies on domain randomization (DR) to generate new levels. DR lacks the fine-grained control over the difficulty progression that ACCEL\'s mutation-based method offers. As a result, even though GENIE exposes the PLR agent to a wider coverage of state-action pairs, the PLR teacher does not present these experiences to the student in an order that facilitates optimal learning. The inherent difference in curriculum generation mechanism between the two algorithms (i.e. ACCEL and PLR) admits a significant difference in performance from the get-go that cannot be recovered by GENIE. To summarize, GENIE enhances the state-action space coverage for both ACCEL and PLR, but ACCEL\'s gradual curriculum complexity introduction mechanism simply capitalizes on that better.\n\n**Q: There may be some confusion between your GENIE and [1]**\n\nA: Acknowledged in global rebuttal.\n\n**Q: For car racing you do use images, is the image simply flattened? Could this have problems with e.g. not being translationally invariant?**\n\nA: All algorithms incorporate a CNN model over the images, in accordance with previous UED literature. We thank you for bringing up this point and we have included a small section in the appendix to make this clear.\n\n**Q: Choosing the range of $K$ (number of GMM) kernels can be challenging?**\n\nA: Actually, $K$ does not need to be constricted to a fixed range and can be adapted online. Metrics like silhouette score (that we used) or other metrics such as AIC/BIC provide a score for the fit of the GMM and Bayesian methods can be applied to search for the $K$ (not bounded to a range) that fulfils a desired threshold of the metric. The reason why we used a fixed range for $K$ in GENIE is simply because we found that a range of 6-15 kernels already provided significant improvements to the GENIE-augmented algorithms and did not necessitate further optimization.\n\n**Q: Do I understand correctly that you just concatenate the observation and actions to form $x$, which is then used to fit the GMM? How can this scale to much larger observations?**\n\nA: Yes, your understanding is correct. Regarding the dimensionality issue, it is an issue which can be easily remedied.

What if there is an environment where an agent needs to conduct some initial behavior (e.g. finding a key) and then using it to act later (e.g. opening a door)? It just feels like the method is designed based on the toy environments we use in RL research, and is not actually scalable for larger more complex domains in the future.**\n\nA: Temporal information can be accounted for by using the augmented states and it should be addressed by the underlying RL mechanism (hierarchical RL, constrained RL, etc.). We would like to highlight that GENIE\'s design to focus on individual *(s, a)* transitions and not entire trajectories is agnostic to these augmented state representations used by the policy. On this note, we would make this advantageous characteristic of GENIE\'s design clearer in the revised manuscript.""\n\n\n**Q: Hate to be that person, but the name GENIE is taken by multiple works already and recently by Bruce et al.

As you pointed out, there is no need to restrict ourselves to GMMs. However, on the flip side, we showed that such a simple yet general method for quantifying novelty and combining it with regret could result in significant empirical gains. GENIE\'s main contribution lies in demonstrating the importance of novelty in UED and highlighting how it complements minimax regret. That opens the door to future UED research to look into incorporating novelty into their curriculum.\n\n**Q: Can you show any examples of levels that have high novelty but low regret, and turn out to be useful training levels for the agent?**\n\nA: Addressed in the global rebuttal (see section ""Low Regret but High Novelty Levels Provide Interesting Experiences"", i.e. Figure 2\'s explanation)'}}, 'id': 'IO7Shxcp6C', 'forum': 'UdxpjKO2F9', 'replyto': 'BrciC5IWlJ', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722957705883, 'cdate': 1722957705883, 'tmdate': 1730882986782, 'mdate': 1730882986782, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We appreciate the reviewer\'s time and valuable feedback.

We kindly request the reviewer to reconsider the score, given that the issues raised do not detract from the contributions of GENIE and the promising direction of novelty-driven autocurricula:\n\n### Questions\n\n**Q: Using unfamiliar states to measure uncertainty is conceptually similar to curiosity-driven approaches in RL. However, the paper doesn\'t review the relevant literature. It would be helpful if the authors explained how their idea aligns with curiosity-based RL theories and what their paper adds to this field.**\n\nA: We appreciate the reviewer\'s astute observation regarding the conceptual similarity between our approach and curiosity-driven RL. While we acknowledge that our original manuscript should have addressed this relationship more explicitly, we\'re grateful for the opportunity to clarify these connections and distinctions. Indeed, both curiosity-driven RL and our UED approach leverage the concept of novelty or unfamiliarity to guide learning. However, they differ significantly in their application and theoretical foundations. Curiosity-driven learning literature is build on prioritising interesting experiences in a **static environment** [1], or across a set of **predefined tasks** [2]. Meanwhile, UED is focussed on **generating environments** that are interesting/useful for learning. UED shapes the learning curriculum itself rather than the exploration strategy within environments. This is analagous to the difference between Prioritized Experience Replay [3] from traditional RL and Prioritized Level Replay [4] from UED. The former is an ""inner-loop"" method to prioritize past experiences for training and the latter is an ""outer-loop"" method that uses past experiences to inform the collection/generation of future experiences. In the same vein, curiosity-driven learning is focussed on prioritizing novel experiences for policy updates but GENIE is focussed on generating/curating levels that can induce these novel experiences. This fundamental difference in purposes means that theoretical and empirical comparison between curiosity-driven approaches and GENIE is not as direct. As such, we focussed our attention mostly towards current novelty measures in UED literature, which we are of more relevance. Still, we thank the reviewer for making this observation as the general audience would also appreciate clarity on this matter. We have included a short section clarifying the distinctions between curiosity-driven learning and GENIE in the appendix of the revised paper. \n\n[1] Pathak, D., Agrawal, P., Efros, A.

Since both papers were evaluated on BipedalWalker and BipedalWalkerHardcore, it would be useful to compare GENIE with Genetic Curriculum.**\n\nA: Thanks for pointing to the work by Song et al. (2022). The other UED papers had not referenced this work or compared against this work. This is likely due to the fact that their problem definition in their paper differs from the *Underspecified Partially Observable Markov Decision Process* (UPOMDP) setting in UED and there is not many parallels other than sharing a commonly-used domain. Also, the original POET [5] paper which they compare against used a 5D-BipedalWalker domain (we used 8D), and it is not clear in their paper which domain they use. To the best of our knowledge and thorough search, their code repository is not publicly accessible and we are unable to replicate their work to compare the results.\n\n[5] Wang, R., Lehman, J., Clune, J., \\& Stanley, K.O.

Will this achieve equilibrium? For instance, if the agent cycles through level sets A, B, and C, potentially forgetting each set as it explores others, will agents trained by GENIE converge to steady-state behavior?**\n\nA:  Your description of a potential ""mode collapse"" behavior is reasonable. However, this seems to be pointing at the general negative effects of catastrophic forgetting within the broader RL literature and function approximation methods. While GENIE does not explicitly guarantee convergence to a steady-state behavior with respect to novelty, it\'s important to note that this challenge is not unique to our approach. The leading approaches, PLR and ACCEL are also unable to provide robustness guarantees against such oscillatory exploration patterns. It would be interesting to start having conversations on how we can bridge insights from ""continual learning"" and ""stability-plasticity dilemma"" literature with UED, and see how minimax-regret and GENIE\'s novelty could possibly circumvent the negative effects of catastrophic forgetting.\n\n**Q: Finally, there are some minor typos and editorial mistakes.

The new results within the global rebuttal and our following clarifications would be of interest to you and strengthen the case for our paper:\n\n### Weaknesses\n**Q: The method would be more convincing if the generated levels were visualized and directly compared. Ideally, demonstrate that new motifs are being generated. For example, display the distribution over stump height late in training of ACCEL and ACCEL-GENIE to show more even coverage by ACCEL-GENIE, and randomly sample a few levels from each for visual confirmation.**\n\nA: Answered in global rebuttal, refer to the section ""GENIE Introduces Level Complexity"" explanation.\n\n**Q: The paper would be improved by exploring the mechanism behind the results in more depth. If the theory is that the diversity term introduces high-regret levels previously excluded from the buffer, it should be demonstrated directly.**\n\nA: This is something we have thought about while working on GENIE. The main struggle with trying to demonstrate this is that both the regret and novelty metric are inherently policy-dependent. As such, it is impossible to directly measure whether prioritising or not prioritising a level via GENIE would lead to discovering a higher regret level down the road because the divergence in realities would result in different policies with non-commensurable subjective regrets. However, one way we can indirectly measure this is by observing whether a greedy selection of high regret levels (as in ACCEL and PLR) or a balanced regret-novelty prioritization (as in ACCEL-GENIE and PLR-GENIE) results in better cumulative/mean regret in the replay buffer across the training horizon. The section ""Prioritizing Novelty Actually Increases Regret"" in our global rebuttal demonstrates that GENIE actually results in higher regret across the replay buffer in the Car-Racing domain despite not directly optimising for it.\n\n\n**Q: On line 258, results are overstated, as ACCEL-GENIE\'s performance is within ACCEL\'s margin of error in nearly all environments. This claim should be corrected. This isn\'t essential for paper acceptance, as the minigrid benchmark is nearly saturated and serves as an MNIST for the field. The empirical results in the other two environments are sufficient.**\n\nA: We have amended line 258 to exclude the remark on ACCEL-GENIE\'s outperformance over its predecessor but the point on PLR-GENIE\'s clear improvement over PLR still holds.\n\n**Q: Add error bars to Table 1. Ensure matching colors for the same method in Figure 7. Fix the stray parenthesis on line 303. Equation 1 should reflect the canonical PAIRED objective, comparing the two expected returns directly, rather than being ""optimized"" for deterministic domains.**\n\nA: Thank you for the attentiveness to detail, we have addressed this in our revised manuscript.\n\n**Q: Consider renaming the model since another prominent environment-generating model named GENIE has been released recently. This will avoid confusion when discussing how the two could be combined.**\n\nA: Addressed in global rebuttal.\n\n**Q: In the abstract I think it is not clear that novelty, on its own, is critical for agent\'s generalisation ability. Two situations that are different but not in a way that is relevant for the task and are processed by the network in the same way are effectively the same, and would not affect generalisation ability.**\n\nA: We are actively refining our abstract to more effectively advocate for the benefits of novelty-driven autocurricula methods, while being mindful of the brevity throughout this rebuttal process. Regarding the notion that ""different situations processed similarly by the network do not affect generalization ability,"" we believe this holds true primarily for fixed curriculum methods but not necessarily for autocurricula methods. We hope to have a constructive discussion about this. \n\nAlthough the two situations present differently but provide similar learning experiences (with relation to the task) at the current moment, they both independently inform the collection/generation of future environments. The fact that these environments behave differently (in state-action distribution) indicates the potential that they can lead to totally different and novel environments down the training horizon, especially with mutation-based methods. Therefore, even if these scenarios yield similar learning signals initially, prioritizing them for the unique state-action distributions they cover via GENIE remains beneficial for generalisation. This is an exciting discussion which can be correspondingly highlighted in our revised manuscript.\n\n**Q: It also appears that in a few places the ""underspecified"" in UPOMDP is taken to mean that there is a one-to-many mapping between parameters and environments. In general this is not the case, as the minigrid environment has a one-to-one mapping between parameters and environments, the ""underspecified"" simply means that these parameters are not given by the designer. It is fair to want UED algorithms to work even when there is such a one-to-many mapping, but it is not required as part of the problem formulation.**\n\nA: We acknowledge that the one-to-many mapping between free parameters and environments, while common, is not a mandated characteristic of UED. We have amended the manuscript to reflect that nuance more clearly (e.g., ""entails there is a one-to-many mapping"" is revised to ""possibly entails a one-to-many mapping""). \n\n\n### Questions\n**Q: What sort of qualitative difference do you see between ACCEL-GENIE and ACCEL levels?**\n\nA: Answered in global rebuttal, refer to the section ""GENIE Introduces Level Complexity"".'}}, 'id': 'hXp2mWAw60', 'forum': 'UdxpjKO2F9', 'replyto': 'cw79iow2AO', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722953817715, 'cdate': 1722953817715, 'tmdate': 1730882986935, 'mdate': 1730882986935, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': '# Global Rebuttal\n\n## 1. Addressing GENIE\'s Name\nThere is a general consensus among the reviewers that ""GENIE"" might be confused with the method recently introduced by Bruce et. al. (2024). We agree that it would probably be wise to choose a different name for the framework, allowing both important works to receive their own deserved spotlights. However, in the meantime, we will still use the acronym ""GENIE"" when referencing our framework during this rebuttal phase to make things less confusing for everyone. We will definitely come up with a different name and implement it across the revised version of the paper.\n\n## 2. Special Thanks to All Reviewers\nWe would like to express our gratitude to all the reviewers for their time in providing constructive evaluations and generally positive reception of our work. \n\n## 3. New Results and Explanation\nWe present new results that are collected in response to the reviewers\' comments (please refer to the attached 1-page PDF). Note that due to limitations in time and computation, we were only able to selectively run experiments. \n\n### 3.1 GENIE Introduces Level Complexity\nFigure 1 presents the difficulty composition (introduced by POET (Wang et al., 2019) of replayed levels for ACCEL and ACCEL-GENIE over various training intervals (based on metrics defined in Table 1).  It is clear that ACCEL predominantly favors ""Easy"" to ""Moderate"" difficulty levels. In contrast, ACCEL-GENIE increasingly incorporates ""Challenging"" levels into its replay set over time. This difference highlights the benefits of integrating GENIE\'s novelty metric into the level replay selection criteria. \n\nThe disparity in level difficulty distribution between ACCEL and ACCEL-GENIE is a critical factor in their observed performance differences. ACCEL\'s training curriculum tends to remain within a comfort zone, where levels with high regret (approximated by TD-error) are greedily selected. This approach constrains the student to a limited subset of simplest environments where it can minimize its maximum prediction error. However, this narrow focus limits the student\'s ability to generalize, as it minimizes exposure to more complex scenarios. On the other hand, ACCEL-GENIE’s incorporation of the novelty metric actively selects more challenging levels. This strategy pushes the student beyond its comfort zone, exposing it to unfamiliar and more challenging environment parameters (e.g. higher stump heights and wider pit gaps). As a result, the student is forced to explore a broader state-action space, enhancing its robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios and leading to the discovery of higher regret levels.\n\nNote that our figure differs from Figure 11 in Parker-Holder et al. (2022) which shows the difficulty distribution of the levels **generated and added into the buffer**, but not the actual levels selected by the teacher for the student to **replay/train on**. On that note, this also demonstrates that GENIE remedies an inefficiency in the original ACCEL algorithm, which is the fact that the mutation-based generation constantly produces high complexity levels (""Challenging"" and above) but none are actually selected to train the student. \n\nAt the moment, we currently lack statistics on the difficulty composition of levels replayed by PLR and PLR-GENIE but their similar performances suggest that the difficulty compositions are likely comparable.\n\n[1] Parker-Holder, J., Jiang, M., Dennis, M., Samvelyan, M., Foerster, J.N., Grefenstette, E., \\& Rocktaschel, T. (2022). Evolving Curricula with Regret-Based Environment Design.\n\n### 3.2 Low Regret but High Novelty Levels Provide Interesting Experiences\nNext, we visually present the effect of the novelty metric on Minigrid levels in the level replay buffer of PLR-GENIE by ablating regret. Specifically, we highlight levels that feature the lowest regret (bottom 10) yet exhibit the highest novelty (top 10); these are showcased in the first row of Figure 2. Conversely, levels that score within the lowest 10 for both regret and novelty are displayed in the second row of the same figure.\n\nVisually, we can observe that levels with high novelty and low regret present complex and diverse scenarios that challenge the student. In contrast, the levels displayed in the second row, characterized by low regret and low novelty, often resemble simple, empty mazes that offer limited learning opportunities.\n\nWhile it is not feasible to present every example level here, the contrast between the two groups is stark. Levels selected based on low regret but high novelty are significantly more varied and intricate than those chosen for their low novelty, despite both groups having low regret scores. This demonstrates that incorporating novelty alongside regret in the selection process enhances the ability to identify levels that present more interesting trajectories (experiences) to the student for learning.\n\n### 3.3 Prioritizing Novelty Actually Increases Regret\nFinally, Figure 3 shows the mean, median and summed regret in the level replay buffer of PLR$^\\perp$ and PLR-GENIE across the training horizon. Surprisingly, PLR-GENIE results in comparable/slightly greater levels of regret across the training distribution despite not directly optimising for it. This observation demonstrates that prioritising novelty in the levels can actually lead to higher regret levels being discovered.'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/0ff6f41108650b9d14ea0b2cd8ae78cf9506c6f8.pdf'}}, 'id': 'dkuNIK0mD0', 'forum': 'UdxpjKO2F9', 'replyto': 'UdxpjKO2F9', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/-/Author_Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722952260172, 'cdate': 1722952260172, 'tmdate': 1730888385736, 'mdate': 1730888385736, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'This paper proposes adding a domain-general metric for promoting novelty to state of the art UED methods in order to help the environment generator better explore and cover the space of environments.

The teacher generates new training environments with high learning potential, curating an adaptive curriculum that strengthens the student's ability to handle unseen scenarios. Existing UED methods mainly rely on *regret*, a metric that measures the difference between the agent's optimal and actual performance, to guide curriculum design. Regret-driven methods generate curricula that progressively increase environment complexity for the student but overlook environment *novelty* — a critical element for enhancing an agent's generalizability. Measuring environment novelty is especially challenging due to the underspecified nature of environment parameters in UED, and existing approaches face significant limitations. To address this, this paper introduces the *Coverage-based Evaluation of Novelty In Environment* (CENIE) framework. CENIE proposes a scalable, domain-agnostic, and curriculum-aware approach to quantifying environment novelty by leveraging the student's state-action space coverage from previous curriculum experiences. We then propose an implementation of CENIE that models this coverage and measures environment novelty using Gaussian Mixture Models. By integrating both regret and novelty as complementary objectives for curriculum design, CENIE facilitates effective exploration across the state-action space while progressively increasing curriculum complexity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that augmenting existing regret-based UED algorithms with CENIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of novelty-driven autocurricula for robust generalization.""}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'reinforcement_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/395c3c5df43310736f6134ab07ff32330b2a8f45.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\nteoh2024improving,\ntitle={Improving Environment Novelty Quantification for Effective Unsupervised Environment Design},\nauthor={Jayden Teoh and Wenjun Li and Pradeep Varakantham},\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=UdxpjKO2F9}\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'teoh|improving_environment_novelty_quantification_for_effective_unsupervised_environment_design'}}, 'id': 'UdxpjKO2F9', 'forum': 'UdxpjKO2F9', 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/Authors'], 'number': 13226, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13226/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1715736982886, 'cdate': 1715736982886, 'tmdate': 1734555401685, 'mdate': 1734555401685, 'pdate': 1727288032479, 'odate': 1730873956103, 'version': 2}]"

In embodied tasks, high-level planning is amenable to direct coding, while low-level actions often necessitate task-specific refinement, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL). To seamlessly integrate both modalities, we introduce a two-level hierarchical framework, RL-GPT, comprising a slow agent and a fast agent. The slow agent analyzes actions suitable for coding, while the fast agent executes coding tasks. This decomposition effectively focuses each agent on specific tasks, proving highly efficient within our pipeline. Our approach outperforms traditional RL methods and existing GPT agents, demonstrating superior efficiency. In the Minecraft game, it rapidly obtains diamonds within a single day on an RTX3090. Additionally, it achieves SOTA performance across all designated MineDojo tasks.",Oral Session 2C: Reinforcement Learning,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LEzx6QRkRH,https://openreview.net/forum?id=LEzx6QRkRH,LEzx6QRkRH,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'This paper discusses how one can design an agent empowered by LLMs that can break down a task into subtasks and dynamically decide whether to solve such a subtask by code generated by the LLM or by a ""traditional"" RL agent. The method is validated in the game Minecraft. This is an interesting paper; all reviewers unanimously recommended its acceptance, and I\'m doing the same.\n\nHowever, an important point about the number of independent runs was made, and the concerns raised are real. I\'m ok accepting this paper because it is a _proof of possibility. It shows how such an idea can be instantiated, and it shows that such an instantiation can work. This is how it should position itself instead of making claims that ""it attains State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance"" (line 60). It is hard to imagine someone justifiably claiming SOTA performance without reporting some notion of variability or robustness. Thus, I strong suggest the authors to change their wording accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, some of the comparisons to RL methods are unfair, mainly when talking about their sample complexity. In line 75, for example, the paper states that the problem with other techniques is that they ""requires billions of steps for fine-tuning long-horizon tasks"". It is crucial to understand that LLMs are generated by going over many, many, many samples (orders of magnitude more than billions). Thus, the comparison above is unfair. LLMs allow one to amortize the cost of such samples because LLMs are a general-purpose model that can bypass the lack of initial knowledge of RL agents.

Instead, default reward functions, such as sparse rewards and distance rewards, are used for agent training in the environment.\n- L136: It means that one of the output dimensions of the RL network will represent the coded high-level action. This high-level action will be executed when the network selects that option.\n- L181: You can find the outputs in lines **185 to 187**. The inputs are simply observations from the environment, as shown in **Tab. 10**.\n\nWe will clarify our method based on your suggestions in future versions.\n\n**Q4.

If decomposition fails to resolve the issue after a certain number of iterations, the task will be handed over to RL.\n\n**Q4.

Using an action space with higher-level actions can **shorten the task horizon and reduce reward sparsity**. This design is more efficient as it leverages the coding ability and common sense of LLMs. For instance, LLMs understand that it takes 10 attacks to break a tree. When designing a reward function, even though ""10 attacks"" yields a high reward, randomly sampling those 10 individual attacks is a time-consuming process. In contrast, with action space design, an action like ""attack 10 times"" can be directly generated, **resulting in an immediate high reward**.\n\n**Q7.

"['Matthew Zurek', 'Yudong Chen']",NeurIPS,Span-Based Optimal Sample Complexity for Weakly Communicating and General Average Reward MDPs,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97954,2024," We study the sample complexity of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an average-reward Markov decision process (MDP) under a generative model. For weakly communicating MDPs, we establish the complexity bound $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{\mathsf{H}}{\varepsilon^2} \right)$, where $\mathsf{H}$ is the span of the bias function of the optimal policy and $SA$ is the cardinality of the state-action space. Our result is the first that is minimax optimal (up to log factors) in all parameters $S,A,\mathsf{H}$, and $\varepsilon$, improving on existing work that either assumes uniformly bounded mixing times for all policies or has suboptimal dependence on the parameters. We also initiate the study of sample complexity in general (multichain) average-reward MDPs. We argue a new transient time parameter $\mathsf{B}$ is necessary, establish an $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{\mathsf{B} + \mathsf{H}}{\varepsilon^2} \right)$ complexity bound, and prove a matching (up to log factors) minimax lower bound. Both results are based on reducing the average-reward MDP to a discounted MDP, which requires new ideas in the general setting. To optimally analyze this reduction, we develop improved bounds for $\gamma$-discounted MDPs, showing that $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{\mathsf{H}}{(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2} \right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{\mathsf{B} + \mathsf{H}}{(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2} \right)$ samples suffice to learn $\varepsilon$-optimal policies in weakly communicating and in general MDPs, respectively. Both these results circumvent the well-known minimax lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(SA\frac{1}{(1-\gamma)^3\varepsilon^2} \right)$ for $\gamma$-discounted MDPs, and establish a quadratic rather than cubic horizon dependence for a fixed MDP instance.",Oral Session 2D: Generative Models,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=pGEY8JQ3qx,https://openreview.net/forum?id=pGEY8JQ3qx,pGEY8JQ3qx,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Reviewers unanimously agree that this is a good paper resolving an important question.

We believe that this is a strength of our results, for several reasons. Simple algorithms are preferable in practice, and our analyses demonstrate that several of the simplest and most well-studied approaches, namely average-to-discounted reduction and the plug-in approach for solving DMDPs, can be used to achieve optimal sample complexity. We believe this is a more impactful result as opposed to a problem-tailored algorithm which is unlikely to be used in practice. Additionally, our results on the plug-in approach for solving DMDPs hold when any algorithm is used to solve the empirical MDP $\\widehat{P}$, which is a stronger result than proving that only a particular algorithm works.\n- Additionally, we believe that our results for general/multichain MDPs represent algorithmic novelties, since conditions for the average-to-discounted reduction to work were not previously known for this setting (and the conditions are different compared to the weakly communicating setting; namely, a different effective horizon is required within the reduction). For example, even when the true transition matrix $P$ is known, our multichain average-to-discounted reduction Theorem 6 suggests new iterative algorithms for solving multichain MDPs: if we (approximately) solve $P$ as a DMDP with effective horizon $(\\mathsf{B}+\\mathsf{H})/\\varepsilon$ by standard discounted value iteration methods, then we get an $\\varepsilon$-gain-optimal policy. This is interesting to compare to usual (undiscounted/average-reward) value iteration, which to our knowledge does not have finite-time guarantees for general MDPs.\n- We agree that generative model access can be a strong assumption, but we note that it can be a building block for algorithms which work in more general settings. Sometimes this may be from an indirect theory-building perspective, and other times algorithms for the generative model can be directly used and combined with another procedure for exploring and obtaining samples in a navigating model. Also, as pointed out by reviewer i8Mw, in commonly studied uniformly mixing settings, the navigating model basically reduces to the generative model (with an additional mixing time complexity factor).\n- Regarding the lower bound, the sampling model is chosen to match that of the generative model, which assumes an equal number of samples from each state-action pair. We believe that an adaptive sampling model would not substantially change the lower bound. (We actually believe that our current lower bound construction could be adapted to this setting, for the following reasons: The construction for Theorem 4 is based on the difficulty of distinguishing amongst a set of $\\Theta(SA)$ different MDPs. Each of these MDPs has a different “special” state-action pair $(s^\\star,a^\\star)$ which yields slightly larger expected average reward but are otherwise identical. Discerning the identity of $(s^\\star,a^\\star)$ by sampling adaptively from different state-action pairs is thus similar to a best-arm identification problem for stochastic multi-armed bandits, so we believe adaptive lower bound arguments from that setting could be used here.)'}}, 'id': 'lKJz3pFSDT', 'forum': 'pGEY8JQ3qx', 'replyto': 'fxb8Jt3bbM', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723005482016, 'cdate': 1723005482016, 'tmdate': 1730883252545, 'mdate': 1730883252545, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': '1. Thank you for making us aware of the updated citation. We will fix this and the other citations which lack locations.\n2. Our definition of Blackwell-optimal policies is standard and matches that of Puterman [14, Chapter 10]. We must use $\\gamma \\in [\\overline{\\gamma}, 1)$ since the discount factor $\\gamma$ must be strictly less than $1$ (the discounted value function is not defined for $\\gamma = 1$). You are correct that the statement $V_\\gamma^{\\pi^\\star} \\geq V_\\gamma^{\\pi}$ means that $V_\\gamma^{\\pi^\\star}(s) \\geq V_\\gamma^{\\pi}(s)$ for all states $s$.\n3. Thank you for catching this issue. $P_{sa} \\rho^\\star = \\sum_{s’} P(s’\\mid s,a) \\rho^\\star(s’)$, as we treat $P_{sa}$ as a row vector. You are correct that there should not be an index in the second definition, which should be written $\\rho^\\star \\geq P_\\pi \\rho^\\star$ (and understood to hold in an elementwise sense), in order for it to be equivalent to the first definition that $\\rho^\\star(s) \\geq \\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} P_{sa} \\rho^\\star$. We will fix this typo.\n4. We agree this is an interesting point. Mathematically, from the reduction from (weakly-communicating) average-reward MDPs to discounted MDPs [20, Proof of Theorem 1], we are guaranteed that if policy $\\pi$ is $\\overline{\\varepsilon}$-optimal for DMDP (meaning $V^\\pi_\\gamma \\geq V_\\gamma^\\star - \\overline{\\varepsilon} \\mathbf{1}\\$), then $\\pi$ has gain at least $\\rho^\\star - C(1-\\gamma)(\\mathsf{H} + \\overline{\\varepsilon})$ for an absolute constant $C$. Note that $(1-\\gamma)$ is the inverse of the effective horizon so this bound goes to $0$ as the effective horizon increases, which is exactly what is done within Theorem 2 as we set the effective horizon to be like $C’ \\frac{\\mathsf{H}}{\\varepsilon}$ (where $\\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy).'}}, 'id': 'qxJg5d9MOG', 'forum': 'pGEY8JQ3qx', 'replyto': 'QSFm3p93XJ', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723004802422, 'cdate': 1723004802422, 'tmdate': 1730883252666, 'mdate': 1730883252666, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': '- We would like to call attention to our results for weakly-communicating MDPs, which we believe represent a major strength of our work as they resolve the longstanding problem of the sample complexity of average-reward MDPs (Theorem 2) with an interesting insight on the complexity of discounted MDPs (Theorem 1). \n- We note that both of the referenced preprints appeared on arXiv after the NeurIPS submission deadline, so they should not contribute negatively to the evaluation of our submission. Still, we are happy to discuss their relation to our work while attempting to maintain our own anonymity.\n  - The preprint by Kaufmann et al. is directly inspired by a preprint version of the present submission. They also provide evidence that the optimal bias span $\\mathsf{H}$ is hard to estimate, although their lower bound instances require randomized rewards unlike our Theorem 3. As suggested by our paper starting at line 276, the diameter $D$ is estimable and upper bounds $\\mathsf{H}$, so a diameter estimation procedure can be used to remove the need for knowledge of $\\mathsf{H}$. Kaufmann et al. formalize this observation and combine an existing algorithm for the generative model which requires knowledge of $\\mathsf{H}$ with a diameter estimation procedure from prior work to get a diameter-based sample complexity in the generative model setting, and they also combine a sample collection procedure for the navigating setting (also from prior work) to be able to apply the existing generative model algorithm to the navigating setting.\n  - The preprint by Boone et al. claims to obtain an optimal span-based regret bound in the online setting without prior knowledge of $\\mathsf{H}$. We are unable to verify their result but we agree it would be highly surprising in light of past conjectures. We note that their result does not imply any sample complexity bounds for our setting, as unlike the episodic finite horizon setting, there is no known regret-to-PAC conversion. In fact, the mentioned paper by Kaufmann et al. provides discussion suggesting such a conversion is impossible, and it also claims to show that no online algorithm with or without knowledge of $\\mathsf{H}$ can identify an $\\varepsilon$-gain-optimal policy with the $\\widetilde{O}(SA\\mathsf{H}/\\varepsilon^2)$ complexity achieved by our algorithm. Regarding simplicity and efficiency, while their algorithm is efficient, it is still very complicated and apparently does not achieve the optimal regret $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{SAHT})$ until at least $T \\geq \\Omega(S^{40}A^{20}H^{10})$. Hence, we still find it surprising that (in our different setting), there exists an optimal algorithm, our Theorem 2, which achieves the optimal complexity $\\widetilde{O}(SA \\mathsf{H}/\\varepsilon^2)$ for all $\\varepsilon < 1$ and is highly simple.\n- We agree that generative model access can be a strong assumption, but we believe that it plays a fundamental theoretical role and its study can lead to algorithms for more general settings. In particular, even when the MDP is not ergodic, algorithms for the navigating setting can reduce to the generative model, which is the approach taken in the mentioned paper by Kaufmann et al., who reduce to the model-based algorithm that we use. Additionally, as discussed starting at line 49, we believe the generative model is particularly natural for studying general/multichain MDPs.\n- The definition of the bounded transient time parameter $\\mathsf{B}$ appears in Section 2 (Problem setup and preliminaries), line 176.\nRegarding the estimation of the bounded transient time parameter $\\mathsf{B}$, we believe that, as you suggest, this parameter may be difficult to estimate. While we believe your point about the discontinuity of $\\mathsf{B}$ is correct, we believe that the discontinuity may not actually be the main obstacle. While generally $\\widehat{P} \\to P$ does not imply $\\mathsf{B}(\\widehat{P}) \\to \\mathsf{B}(P)$, the natural sampling model also ensures that the support of $\\widehat{P}$ is contained within that of $P$ (and eventually their supports must be equal), and with this additional constraint (on the sequence of empirical transition matrices) we should have $\\mathsf{B}(\\widehat{P}) \\to \\mathsf{B}(P)$. However, we are unsure how to compute the function $\\mathsf{B}(\\widehat{P})$ without enumerating exponentially many policies. Consequently we believe $\\mathsf{B}$ can only be tractably bounded for small MDPs or when there is some prior knowledge/structure in the MDP.\n- Regarding your comment that MDPs of size 10 are impossible to learn, we are not sure which measure of size you refer to. For MDPs with $S \\cdot A = 10$, our algorithms would be highly practical. For MDPs with a number of states on the order of $2^{10}$, we agree that tabular algorithms such as ours would not be practical, and instead function approximation would be needed. We hope that analogous to episodic MDPs, our study of the average-reward tabular setting can lead towards algorithms using function approximation methods.'}}, 'id': 'LR2nlz7RkN', 'forum': 'pGEY8JQ3qx', 'replyto': 'askCfOWK42', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723004573361, 'cdate': 1723004573361, 'tmdate': 1730883252700, 'mdate': 1730883252700, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thank you for your positive review.'}}, 'id': 'zjKUvBS8C6', 'forum': 'pGEY8JQ3qx', 'replyto': 'vJEO68yWK2', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14527/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723004365891, 'cdate': 1723004365891, 'tmdate': 1730883253428, 'mdate': 1730883253428, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'The paper resolves the open problem of designing an algorithm for the generative tabular average reward setting for weakly communicating MDPs that achieves optimal span-dependent sample complexity with known span.

Challenging this norm, we posit that ''Not all tokens in a corpus are equally important for language model training''. Our initial analysis examines token-level training dynamics of language model, revealing distinct loss patterns for different tokens. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a new language model called Rho-1. Unlike traditional LMs that learn to predict every next token in a corpus, Rho-1 employs Selective Language Modeling (SLM), which selectively trains on useful tokens that aligned with the desired distribution. This approach involves scoring training tokens using a reference model, and then training the language model with a focused loss on tokens with higher scores. When continual continual pretraining on 15B OpenWebMath corpus, Rho-1 yields an absolute improvement in few-shot accuracy of up to 30% in 9 math tasks. After fine-tuning, Rho-1-1B and 7B achieved state-of-the-art results of 40.6% and 51.8% on MATH dataset, respectively - matching DeepSeekMath with only 3% of the pretraining tokens. Furthermore, when continual pretraining on 80B general tokens, Rho-1 achieves 6.8% average enhancement across 15 diverse tasks, increasing both data efficiency and performance of the language model pre-training.",Oral Session 3A: Generative Models,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=0NMzBwqaAJ,https://openreview.net/forum?id=0NMzBwqaAJ,0NMzBwqaAJ,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Please add a full explanation of Figure 7 in the ablation study'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Hello, I read your article in detail and found it very interesting.\nIn figure 7, in the ablation study, you ask how does the selected/un-selected tokens' loss correlate with downstream performance.\nThe graphs you provide seem to align with the intuition that a decrease in the selected tokens' loss correlates with higher downstream performance, and the opposite for the un-selected tokens.\n\nUnfortunately you do not provide an explanation for how this data was generated.\nParticularly I'm not sure I see what differs between different points of the same color on the graphs.\nIf I understand correctly, every row of five points (five colors) represents the downstream performance of a model whose selected (/un-selected) tokens' loss, at each of the five checkpoints, is the x-value.\nSo, what changes between different rows of points?

I appreciate the additional context, but I must respectfully disagree with several points:\n\n1. While your application to token-level selection is indeed novel and valuable, the core method - computing excess loss between a reference and training model - is identical to RhoLoss, the reducible hold-out loss. That you independently arrived at the same solution actually strengthens the case that this is a fundamental approach worth acknowledging properly. Your discovery that it works well at the token level is a significant contribution, but it builds on the same mathematical foundation.\n\n2. Regarding the naming: While I understand the phi/rho/sigma series explanation, it\'s worth noting that when you were made aware of this similarity in April 2024, you had the opportunity to either change the name or explicitly acknowledge and explain this coincidence. The current minimal citation of Mindermann et al (2022) as just another ""online batch selection method"" doesn\'t adequately address this.\n\n3. Your explanation of the method\'s development is interesting, but it actually highlights how similar the underlying principles are. RhoLoss was also motivated by the need to balance between selecting learnable examples while avoiding either too simple or too noisy ones, as you can see in the extensive treatment of this in the paper. This is why we used the difference between reference and training model losses - exactly the same solution you arrived at two years later.\n\n---\n\nTo illustrate just how fundamentally similar the methods are, here is the pseudocode for both approaches:\n\nRhoLoss (Mindermann et al., ICML 2022):\n```python\ndef rholoss(batch, model, reference_model):\n    # losses shape (batch_size,) for classification\n    train_losses = compute_losses(batch, model)\n    ref_losses = compute_losses(batch, reference_model)\n    excess_loss = train_losses - ref_losses\n    threshold = np.percentile(excess_loss, 100 * (1 - k_percent))\n    mask = excess_loss > threshold\n    train_model(batch[mask], model)\n```\n\nSelective Language Modeling (this work, 2024):\n```python\ndef selective_language_modeling(batch, model, reference_model):\n    # losses shape (batch_size, seq_len) for lm\n    train_losses = compute_losses(batch, model)\n    ref_losses = compute_losses(batch, reference_model)\n    excess_loss = train_losses - ref_losses\n    threshold = np.percentile(excess_loss.flatten(), 100 * (1 - k_percent))  # Only difference: .flatten()\n    mask = excess_loss > threshold\n    train_model(batch[mask], model) # backprop through train_losses[mask]\n```\n\n**Note**: The _only_ difference is the `.flatten()` operation to go from `(batch_size, seq_len)` to `(batch_size*seq_len)` for token-wise selection. The core idea of computing excess loss and sub-selection is identical.\n\n---\n\nAdditionally, after spending more time with the paper, I have concerns about the efficiency claims. While you demonstrate faster convergence in terms of number of training steps, the actual wall-clock time savings deserve more rigorous analysis. Due to the nature of transformer attention:\n   \n- All tokens in a sequence must be processed in the forward pass to maintain context\n- Attention must be computed across all tokens in the sequence\n- Hence, if any token in a sequence is selected, backpropagation will still have to be computed for all prior tokens in that sequence (due to causal attention).\n\nThis means that while the average loss might be computed for the sub-selected tokens, the actual computational savings would be much smaller than implied by the ""10x faster"" and ""5x faster"" claims in your paper since each step still requires nearly the same computations for backpropagation as standard training.\n\n---\n\nWould you be willing to update the paper to include:\n\n1. A clear acknowledgment of RhoLoss (Mindermann et al., ICML 2022) as prior work that developed the core method of excess loss computation\n2. A proper comparison and discussion in the related work section, highlighting both the similarities and your novel contributions in token-level application (also e.g. in regards to _your analysis of token losses as L-L, H-L, H-L, H-H vs Mindermann et al\'s analysis of samples as being noisy, redundant, not relevant, or worth training on_)\n3. A more detailed analysis of actual wall-clock time savings, including the computational overhead of computing both reference and training model losses, and the limitations imposed by transformer architectures.\n\nThis would strengthen your paper while maintaining appropriate scientific attribution and providing a more complete analysis of the method\'s efficiency.\n\n_PS: Regarding the last point, it seems Reviewer __pLtQ__ had similar concerns about the actual training speed vs. data efficiency, but the revision you promised in your response did not seem to have happened. It would seem a good idea to fulfill promises made during the response period._'}}, 'id': 'GLEg86VHg1', 'forum': '0NMzBwqaAJ', 'replyto': 'dZcOZBIIVe', 'signatures': ['~Andreas_Kirsch1'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', '~Andreas_Kirsch1'], 'number': 3, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5208/-/Public_Comment'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1734091117325, 'cdate': 1734091117325, 'tmdate': 1734152788821, 'mdate': 1734152788821, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': 'Thanks for your comments.

Our work takes a token-level perspective, while your work focuses on sample-level data selection, which is not the primary focus of our research. Meanwhile, we concentrate mainly on the pre-training process, investigating the importance of tokens during this phase, as reflected in our title, ""Not All Tokens Are What You Need for Pretraining.""\n\n2. The name ""rho-1"" follows our existing ""phi-1/phi-3.5"" series (and we are also developing ""sigma-1""), signifying ""information density."" This is purely coincidental with your 2022 work. We primarily focused on recent works related to data selection in the pre-training of large language models, which led to an oversight of your work and, consequently, some misunderstandings. At your previous request, we have added a reference to ""rho-loss"" as an ""online batch selection method"" in the related work section of the camera-ready version. We would like to adding more discussion about your work in our next version.\n\n3. The method for selecting tokens is flexible. For instance, we provide alternative approaches for selecting tokens in Appendix H.  From our design perspective, we initially trained a reference model on high-quality data, aiming to model a high-quality distribution. We then directly scored and filtered the pre-training tokens using this model. However, we found that this approach tends to select overly simple tokens and fails to reflect the training dynamics of the target model. To address this, we incorporated the current model’s loss to calculate an ""excess loss."" We discovered that this method effectively selects clean tokens with appropriate difficulty for learning, preventing the model from discarding ""challenging tokens"" and resulting in better performance.'}}, 'id': 'LrbDoSUjXE', 'forum': '0NMzBwqaAJ', 'replyto': 'dZcOZBIIVe', 'signatures': ['~Zhenghao_Lin1'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', '~Zhenghao_Lin1'], 'number': 2, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5208/-/Public_Comment'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1734034604240, 'cdate': 1734034604240, 'tmdate': 1734034604240, 'mdate': 1734034604240, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': 'Important Prior Work Attribution: RhoLoss and Rho-1'}, 'comment': {'value': 'I am writing to note an important oversight in attribution that should be addressed, particularly given this paper\'s selection as a runner-up for the [NeurIPS 2024 Best Paper Award](https://blog.neurips.cc/2024/12/10/announcing-the-neurips-2024-best-paper-awards/)---a recognition that highlights its visibility.\n\nThe paper presents ""Selective Language Modeling (SLM)"" which uses an ""excess loss"" scoring mechanism that appears to be fundamentally equivalent to the RhoLoss method introduced in ""Prioritized Training on Points that are Learnable, Worth Learning, and Not Yet Learnt"" ([Mindermann et al., ICML 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07137)).

Therefore, in the revised version, we will highlight the advantages of the method from the perspective of data efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to clarify that we only need to perform a single forward pass for scoring, which is significantly faster than the training process.

However, due to budget constraints, we were unable to conduct large-scale pre-training from scratch. We will leave the exploration of SLM in pre-training from scratch for future work.\n\nIt is worth noting that SLM not only achieved excellent results in continual pre-training for math but also showed significant improvements in general knowledge, such as MMLU (+11.3%), and in coding tasks, such as MBPP (p@10, +7.8%) and HumanEval (p@10, +10.6%), on TinyLlama, which has been pre-trained with 3T tokens, as shown in\xa0**Figure 5**.\n\nWe will revise the relevant claims and sections according to your comments and change the term ""pre-training"" to ""continual pre-training"" where appropriate.\n\n### **W3.

Just as you mentioned, we have reserved the weighting method for future work in Appendix B.\n\n### **Q1a. The contents of each token category**\n\nIn Figures 11-14, we have provided examples including four categories of tokens and several examples of selected tokens. Due to the excessive length of the examples, we have placed a small number of visualization results in the appendix for interested readers to observe the actual situation of tokens in different contexts. According to your opinion, we will increase the number of related examples in revision.\n\n### **Q1b. Token category statistic**\n\nThis sounds like an interesting statistic and we consider supplementing it in Appendix G. According to our observation, in most cases, each token will belong to different categories in different contexts, but there will be a tendency of the categories. For example, some token with word suffixes frequently appear in the L→L category.\n\n### **Q1c. Figure 14**\n\nThe intention of placing Figure 14 in the appendix was to demonstrate that, even with the same context during the training process, the scores obtained for each token at different training stages were not completely consistent. This was done to help better understand the training dynamics of SLM.\n\n### **Q2. Release plan**\n\nWe will release the pre-trained and fine-tuned Rho-1B and Rho-7B. Meanwhile, the data and code will be open-sourced after review process.\n\n### **Q3. Impact of SLM on memorization of pretraining data**\n\nThis is a very interesting question! Methods like Selective Language Modeling (SLM), which selectively include or exclude token losses during training, show great potential in addressing issues such as memorization and repetition in LLMs. And we have also discovered that recent work using similar methods has yielded promising results. [1] We believe this is an area worthy of further exploration!\n\n### **Other suggestions**\n\nFinally, thank you very much for your meticulous suggestions! They are very helpful for us in improving the paper!\n\n---\n\n[1] Hans, Abhimanyu, et al. ""Be like a Goldfish, Don\'t Memorize!

This may be making some results misleading. This ambiguity is present throughout the paper. Just one example is in 3.3 - is 80B the total before filtering or after filtering?\n\n> Relatedly, in the case when it\'s after the % filtering, the ""x-axis"" should be total number of tokens before filtering in my opinion, because the % filtering isn\'t making training cheaper. I believe the results will still look good after these changes (the numbers in Table 1, for example, are great). But I think Figure 1, for example, should use total tokens (not after % filtering) if it\'s not already.\n\nFor a fair comparison, we default to using “number of tokens\xa0**before**\xa0filtering” when we say “tokens” throughout the paper, just as you suggested.\n\nOn this basis, when referring to the actual selected tokens used for training\xa0**after**\xa0filtering, we usually make a special note, such as in L165:\n\n> ""15 billion tokens (selecting 10.5 billion tokens)"".\n\nIt is worth noting that in Tables 1, 3, and 5, the total number of input tokens (i.e., before filtering) for all comparative experiments is the same. Therefore, to facilitate the presentation of the actual training tokens, we use “Uniq. Toks” to denote unique tokens and “Train Toks” to denote selected tokens. This is additionally clarified in the caption of Table 1.\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion to define ""number of tokens"" more clearly, and we will specifically clarify this point in the paper and table captions to make it more explicit.\n\n### **OpenWebMath**\n\n> It seems like OpenWebMath is very messy. How would this method work on a clean dataset (like the small, high-quality reference dataset). Is the benefit of the method mostly in ""cleaning"" the data, or in selecting useful tokens?\n\nAs we know, OpenWebMath is currently a relatively high-quality open-source pre-trained dataset for mathematics. It has undergone meticulous cleaning and is widely adopted by various models [1]. Nevertheless, scoring with the reference model can still identify ""messy"" and dirty data, as shown in Appendix C, particularly the noisy tokens within a single document that cannot be filtered by traditional document-level methods.\n\nSecondly, we believe that the concepts of ""cleaning"" the data and ""selecting useful tokens"" overlap. SLM achieves the effect of filtering the data by selecting useful tokens for the relevant field from the pre-trained data. Therefore, we assert that both ""cleaning"" and ""selecting"" are present in our settings.\n\nMoreover, our work focuses on pre-training. Whether the SLM method can still be effective with high-quality data, such as in SFT, remains a question for future work. We believe this is a good scenario to validate whether SLM can bring benefits solely through ""selecting”.\n\n###  **How to choose k% for filtering**\n\n> How was the % for filtering chosen for the experiments?\n\nIn the pre-experiment phase, we trained on small-scale data subsets with different percentages and observed the model\'s accuracy to guide our selection, as shown in\xa0**Figure 9**. We found that within a certain percentage range (e.g., from 50% to 70%), there was no significant difference in performance. Therefore, we directly chose 60% and 70% for the larger-scale experiments.\n\n---\n[1] Azerbayev, Zhangir, et al.

Yet, these models still struggle with understanding the nuances of human humor through juxtaposition, particularly when it involves nonlinear narratives that underpin many jokes and humor cues.  This paper investigates this challenge by focusing on comics with contradictory narratives, where each comic consists of two panels that create a humorous contradiction. We introduce the YesBut benchmark, which comprises tasks of varying difficulty aimed at assessing AI's capabilities in recognizing and interpreting these comics, ranging from literal content comprehension to deep narrative reasoning. Through extensive experimentation and analysis of recent commercial or open-sourced large vision language models, we assess their capability to comprehend the complex interplay of the narrative humor inherent in these comics.

While we appreciate the reviewer's efforts, we would like to briefly clarify a few points in the Reviewer 2fnt’s reply in case of any potential misunderstandings.\n> The novelty of the paper is quite limited & nonlinear reasoning abilities of VLMs have been studied for a long time\n\nWe would like to clarify that our work is not to “**just from reasoning on single image to a pair of images**”. Instead, our focus is on understanding complex, nonlinear narratives that emerge through the juxtaposition, particularly in contexts that involve abstract, human-centered events as depicted in comics. This is important for VLMs, which have been shown to struggle with deep, nonlinear reasoning by recent work. By exploring how VLMs understand contradictions and abstract social concepts through sophisticated reasoning processes, we aim to uncover insights that are critical for the advancement of these large models and can guide future developments in the field.\n\n\n> authors do not provide inter-human annotator agreement\n\nWe would like to clarify that our annotations are not generated by models, but rigorously produced by human annotators with the assistance of GPT4. Each sample is annotated, verified, and checked by **at least three annotators** (constituting 43% of our total annotator pool) to ensure that each annotation achieves a high degree of consensus. Therefore, it is not feasible for us to compute inter-human annotator agreement because annotators do not produce annotations **individually and independently**. \n\n\n> The example suggests that the authors did not handle the subjectiveness of the dataset very well\n\nWe formalize title understanding as a “selection task” where the positive title is deemed more appropriate based on *common* interpretations, instead of a “binary classification” task about right or wrong. For this specific example, the positive title is “commonly” considered to be better than the negative options.\n\n\n> concerns on the cultural bias\n\nCultural bias often arises from varying interpretations across different cultural backgrounds. To reduce such bias and focus on common interpretation, in the annotation process each sample is **verified by multiple annotators from different cultural backgrounds**. Their **consensus** was required for an annotation to be included; if no consensus was reached, the annotation was either modified or excluded from the dataset. This approach ensures that we retain only samples that minimize cultural bias.\n\nWhile this approach significantly reduces bias, it is important to acknowledge that no dataset can completely eliminate bias. We recognize that our annotator pool may not represent every cultural perspective, and we are committed to including a more detailed discussion of this limitation in our revised paper.\n\n> concerns on metric\n\nOur use of BERT score, ROUGE-2 (recall), and GPT-based evaluation scores is designed to assess whether the model-generated outputs accurately capture the key information of the narratives. Achieving this level of generation inherently needs “*the depth of understanding required for humor comprehension*”. While these metrics may appear surface-level, they are effective proxies for measuring the model's comprehension, as they ensure that the outputs reflect a nuanced understanding of the comic.\n\n\nAgain, we thank Reviewer 2fnt for providing constructive comments and suggestions. We also thank Reviewer 2fnt for the reply of our rebuttal.  We will revise the paper to better incorporate these insights and clarify the unclear parts.""}}, 'id': '6nWySwGScY', 'forum': 'bCMpdaQCNW', 'replyto': 'iJceHnxRMA', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/Authors'], 'number': 15, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723564173063, 'cdate': 1723564173063, 'tmdate': 1730890114866, 'mdate': 1730890114866, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': 'Responses to new updates'}, 'comment': {'value': 'I engaged in the discussion relatively earlier, and I saw a few new messages coming up.

I still have many concerns about this paper. \n\n- I still feel the novelty of the paper is quite limited. The ACL best paper [1], published in 13 Sep 2022 on arxiv, already have started human understanding from cartoon. And this submission just change it two a specific, narrow-domain situation: presenting a pair of pictures (i.e., Juxtaposition). Although this is a nice extension for studying VLMs\' ability of reasoning on two images instead of one, such reasoning abilities of VLMs have already been studied with many other multi-image VQA tasks for a long time. I don\'t think the creation process of this dataset is novel neither. The authors also claim that the major difference from this submission to [1] is just from reasoning on single image to a pair of images.  \n\n- the tasks are subjective by nature so a larger set of annotators per example is need but authors do not provide inter-human annotator agreement.  In the example that I mentioned ""The negative title ""Graphs Don\'t Lie, People Do"" in the example of Figure 2"". I think this can already show the problem -- you think it is not ""appropriate"" but I feel it is --- intentionally showing partial or chosen factual information is a form of lie.  We may not need to agree with each other on this, but this suggests that the authors did not handle the subjectiveness of the dataset very well. \n\n- concerns on the cultural bias is still there. the authors did not explain well what they did to ensure the content in the dataset only contain culture-insensitive tasks. \n\n- concern on the metric: ""Metrics: The primary evaluation metrics include BERT score, ROUGE-2 (recall), and GPT-based evaluation scores for literal description and contradiction generation tasks. While these metrics are useful for assessing surface-level content generation, they may not fully capture the depth of understanding required for humor comprehension."" \nThe authors\' response in the general rebuttal does not address this point very well.  \n\n\nTo sum up, I think the dataset is fun and interesting and may be a good contribution, but in my humble opinion it is a bit less suitable for the main track at NeurIPS. I have also read the comments from other reviewers.

However, it is important to clarify that **GPT-4 does not replace human judgment** in our workflow. Instead, we employ a **rigorous** dual human-AI collaborative annotation process to ensure the quality and appropriateness of the annotations: GPT4 is only used to produce an initial result, which is then revised and verified by human annotators to produce the final annotations. Specifically, **every output generated by GPT-4 is subject to thorough verification by multiple human annotators**. Any content flagged as potentially offensive is promptly modified or removed by the annotators. To further reduce biases and ensure fairness in our annotations, we have implemented the following measures:\n \n1. Diverse Annotator Backgrounds: Our annotators come from different genders and diverse cultural backgrounds, including North America and East Asia, providing a range of perspectives. This diversity helps to mitigate cultural and gender biases in humor interpretation.\n\n2. Consensus Among Annotators: The annotation process incorporates multiple quality checks and verifications to ensure consensus among different annotators. Any comics with controversy and potential bias are filtered out. During the cross verification stages, annotations identified as biased by any annotator are properly modified. This process helps reduce biases stemming from individual perspectives.\n\n\nDespite these efforts, we acknowledge that our annotations may still carry inherent biases. We will further clarify this and discuss the potential biases in the Limitation section for better guidance of future usage of our benchmark.\n\n\n> Please add to the evaluation section … where GPT4 created anything that could be considered as offensively humorous\n\nThis is a good suggestion! We have conducted additional analysis following [1] to detect offensive content in GPT4-generated literal descriptions and contradictions using the Google banned word list [2]. No offensive outputs were identified. This is likely due to our rigorous filtering of comics with potentially harmful content before feedforwarding into models. Additionally, due to the time limitations, we have conducted a follow-up human evaluation by asking annotators to further evaluate the 30 random samples used in our human evaluations (as shown in Figure 3), and no offensive content was detected. We will include these in the evaluation section. \n\nIn conclusion, we greatly appreciate your valuable feedback.

We appreciate your recognition of our problem formulation as novel and our experimental and evaluation methods as comprehensive. We are also encouraged that you think our work can provide insights for future research. We will revise our paper and incorporate additional discussions in Limitations. Below, we address your questions and concerns:\n\n\n### W1: The dataset size\n\nPlease see point 1 in the Overall Response.\n\n---\n\n### W2 & Q4: Bias mitigation in annotation\n\nThank you for raising this good point! Please see Overall Response point 2.\n\n---\n\n### W3 & Q3: Decomposition does not lead to consistent improvements\n\nThank you for this good question. Our manual analysis identifies two potential reasons. First, VLMs sometimes **misinterpret visual content**, leading to incorrect descriptions. This issue is also highlighted in Section 6.3. Such errors can cause **cascading errors** in the subsequent deep reasoning tasks. Second, the generated descriptions are often lengthy (over 100 words), resulting in more complex input prompts, which can complicate the reasoning process for VLMs. \n\nAdditionally, the decomposition is less beneficial for title matching than philosophy. Titles are more abstract and require more in-depth reasoning, whereas decomposition of surface-level description may not suffice. We will update our paper to include examples that better illustrate these potential causes.\n\n---\n\n### W4 & Q6: Concrete suggestions and proposal on future improvements \n\nThank you for your insightful suggestion! We agree that highlighting directions for future research is crucial. Currently, we aim to uncover potential areas for improvement through our results analyses. \n\nFirst, our analysis indicates that VLMs often struggle with accurately interpreting image content and may make errors in literal descriptions (Sec. 6.1 & 6.2). This suggests a need for future work to **enhance visual interpretation capabilities**. \n\nSecond, improving the **in-depth reasoning ability** of VLMs is essential. For instance, LLaVA-1.6 significantly outperforms LLaVA-1.5, likely due to the advancements in reasoning abilities [1]. Future work might incorporate recent advanced reasoning approaches (e.g., multi-agent debate, refinement-based reasoning) to further improve model performance.\n\nFinally, our error analysis reveals that models tend to suffer from hallucination (Line 333), suggesting the need for **incorporating external knowledge** to enhance human understanding. To mitigate this problem, knowledge augmentation methods can be employed to enhance VLMs performance. \n\nWe will revise our paper to include a dedicated section that provides a more detailed discussion on these points and outlines future research directions. \n\n---\n\n### Q1: Different cultural contexts or styles\n\nThis is a good question. Currently, we focus on humor understanding based on **common interpretation** rather than individual preferences with specific contextual information. However, we recognize that understanding humor and accounting for cultural and stylistic variations is crucial. In future work, we plan to delve deeper into these nuances by incorporating more contextual information into the predictions. We will also include a more detailed discussion on this part in our revised version.\n\n---\n\n### Q2: Expanding the benchmark\n\nYes, we plan to expand our benchmark to include comics with more than two panels. This will allow us to evaluate models' ability to understand more complex narrative structures. Additionally, we will incorporate comics with diverse narrative logic types beyond contradictions. We are committed to continuously updating our benchmark to foster future research in this area.\n\n---\n\n### Q5: Correlation with pre-training\n\nThis is a very insightful question! First, we believe that the reasoning ability and world knowledge of VLMs are highly correlated with their performance on our benchmark. Two observations support this hypothesis: (1) Larger models typically outperform smaller models, and it is widely recognized that larger models tend to have better reasoning abilities and world knowledge; (2) LLaVA-1.6 significantly outperforms LLaVA-1.5, likely due to advancements in these aspects [1].\n\nSecond, social understanding ability is also highly correlated with model performance. The comics in the YESBUT benchmark mainly focus on daily life concepts, and understanding these nuances requires a deep understanding of human norms. \n\nTherefore, improving models' abilities in reasoning, world knowledge, and social understanding during the pretraining stage will enhance their performance on this task. We will incorporate this discussion into our revised version.\n\n\n[1] Llava-next: Improved reasoning, ocr, and world knowledge\n\n\n---\n\n### Suggestions on Limitations\n\nThank you for your detailed and valuable suggestions! We acknowledge the raised limitations, and we will revise our paper and incorporate your raised points. We will discuss these aspects in greater depth to ensure that our work is aligned with responsible AI practices, respecting cultural and social nuances.

We are pleased to learn that you consider our benchmark novel, which includes two input images per sample to emphasize the relationship between the images. Additionally, we are grateful for your acknowledgment of our task settings and good analysis. Below, we address each of your concerns and questions in detail:\n\n### W1: The dataset size is relatively small, which might lead to instability of the scores\n\n> Regarding relative small dataset size\n\nThanks for raising this comment. Please see point 1 in the Overall Response.\n\n> Regarding potential instability of the scores and significance analyses\n\nThis is a good point. To enhance the stability and reduce potential bias, we create three distinct prompts for each task and report the average scores from three runs with each prompt (Line 213). Here, we include additional significance analyses for the description and contradiction generation tasks on VLMs. Specifically, we consider the results from all three prompts, resulting in each model producing 1,044 outputs per task. We use t-test [1] for statistical significance analysis:\n\n1. For description generation: GPT4 is significantly better than other baselines on all metrics (p<0.0001). Claude-3 achieves the second best result and is significantly better than all open-sourced VLMs (p<0.0001). \n\n2. For contradiction generation: Similarly, GPT4 output is significantly better than other baselines on all metrics (p<0.01). However, the results between Claude-3 and LLaVA-1.6-13B  on ROUGE-2 and between Claude-3 and CogVLM on BERT score are not significant. \n\nWe will incorporate the complete results in our revised version.\n\n[1] https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html\n\n---\n\n### W2: The subjectiveness of the task and the noise of automatic metrics.\n\n> Subjectiveness of the task\n\nThis is a good point! Indeed, humor understanding can be subjective. To address this, we have designed our tasks to minimize subjectivity. Specifically, we formalized **literal description and contradiction generation** as text generation tasks because they are **less subjective** and focus on specific descriptions and narrative illustrations of the comics. For the more abstract and subjective components, such as underlying philosophy and title selection, we formulated them as **selection tasks** (i.e., determining which title is “objectively” better), and evaluated these using straightforward accuracy metrics. We will better clarify this in our revision.\n\n> The noise of automatic metrics\n\nRegarding evaluation metrics, we acknowledge that evaluations of text generation tasks remain challenging, and current automatic metrics have limitations. To mitigate this issue: (1) For semantic-based evaluations like BERT score and Rouge, we report **recall scores** to measure how many key points of the reference are captured by the model, ensuring a more precise assessment of content coverage.\n(2) To mitigate bias in GPT-based evaluations, we use different GPT variants for different purposes: for experiments, we use the gpt-4-vision-preview version as a baseline, while for evaluation, we employ the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 version. This approach helps **reduce potential bias towards the GPT4 model’s own generation**.\n\nWe will revise our paper to better clarify these points and discuss the potential limitations of automatic evaluations in more detail. Despite the inherent challenges, we believe our approach offers valuable insights into the model's capabilities.\n\n---\n### W3: Human performance\n\nThank you for this good suggestion! We have included human performance. Due to time constraints, we randomly select 50 samples and ask two participants to perform the underlying philosophy selection and title matching tasks. One participant is male and the other is female, with cultural backgrounds from East Asia and North America, respectively, to ensure a fair and diverse evaluation.\n\nThe results are shown as below. These results highlight the significant room for improvement for VLMs on these tasks. We will revise our paper to incorporate these discussions.\n\n| Acc(%) | LLaVA-1.6-34B | Claude-3 | GPT-4 | Human |\n|-----------|---------------------|---------------|----------|------------|\n| Philosophy | 82.00 | 85.55 | 77.33 | 94.00 |\n| Title | 66.00 |68.00 | 62.00 | 93.00 |\n\n---\n\n### Q1: Details of GPT used for evaluation\n\nWe employ the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 variant for the automatic evaluation.

Compared to the literal description and contradiction illustration, philosophy and title are more open-ended and subjective, where there might exist multiple valid philosophies and titles for one comic. This characteristic makes the evaluation of these two tasks challenging if formulating them as text generation. Therefore, we follow previous work and formulate them as MCQs [1,2].\n\n[1] Can Large Multimodal Models Uncover Deep Semantics Behind Images? \\\n[2] Do Androids Laugh at Electric Sheep? Humor “Understanding” Benchmarks from The New Yorker Caption Contest\n\n---\n### Q2: The diversity of the benchmark \n\nThank you for raising this good question! The comics in our benchmark encompass a diverse range of everyday life scenarios. To ensure and analyze the topic coverage, we prompted ChatGPT to generate topical keywords for each comic based on its description and then clustered these keywords. The complete clusters and their statistics are provided in the one-page PDF of the Overall Response. The results indicate the diversity of our benchmark. We will incorporate the analysis in our revised version.\n\n---\n### Q3: Would the prompts play crucial roles in models’ decision making?\n\nTo address the potential influence of prompts on model performance, in the experiments we created three distinct prompts for each task and reported the average scores from three runs with each prompt. The specific prompt sets are detailed in Appendix C.3. Our initial observations indicate that different VLMs exhibit varying degrees of sensitivity to prompts (for example, commercial models are less sensitive to the prompts than smaller VLMs); however, the overall performance gap across different prompts is not significant. We will revise the relevant section to clarify this point more effectively.\n\n---\n### Q4 : Why GPT-4 can engage in the annotation as well as the model comparison? Will that involve any bias?\n\nThis is a good question! To clarify, we use different GPT variants for distinct purposes: For data annotation, we leverage the gpt4-turbo variant; for experiments, we report results using gpt-4-vision-preview; and for GPT-based automatic evaluation on text generation tasks, we employ gpt-3.5-turbo-0125. While we do use different GPT models variants, there might still be some inherent bias since we do not know the backend model details. We will revise our paper to better clarify this distinction and acknowledge the potential for bias.'}}, 'id': 'I0ZD7L8Tqn', 'forum': 'bCMpdaQCNW', 'replyto': 'wcw278hWsz', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723017760398, 'cdate': 1723017760398, 'tmdate': 1730884018419, 'mdate': 1730884018419, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thank you for your valuable and constructive comments. We appreciate your recognition of our work\'s innovative benchmarks, human-AI collaborative annotation, and insightful analysis. Below, we address your concerns and questions individually:\n\n### W1 & W5: Regarding Novelty and Suitability\n \nThank you for the feedback! However, we believe our work is uniquely novel and suitable for this venue. First, our benchmark formulates a new task to address humor understanding through narrative contradictions, a complex and underexplored aspect of AI research. This task challenges models to integrate **multiple fundamental abilities** including the comprehension of human norms, critical thinking about similarities and differences of elements, and nonlinear reasoning, which are critical for developing socially intelligent systems. Reviewers aFj6 and yTj4 have recognized these contributions, which we will clarify further in our revision. In addition, our work extends beyond a dataset introduction with **comprehensive evaluations and detailed analyses, providing valuable insights into AI\'s interpretive and reasoning capabilities**, making it highly relevant for broader AI and NLP communities. As a pilot study on this topic, we believe our work is suitable for the venue and can bring valuable insights for future research.\n\n---\n\n### W2: Limitation of benchmark\n\n> juxtaposition may not be broadly applicable\n\nThis is a good point. Juxtaposition is a common and sophisticated technique with applications in domains such as arts, literary, and mathematics [1]. As a pilot study, we consider it as a suitable entry point for evaluating complex narrative understanding for AI models.\n\n> The task of matching comics with titles involves a high degree of subjectivity\n\nThank you for this important question. Indeed, humor understanding can be subjective. To address this, we have formalized title matching as a **selection task rather than a generation task** (i.e., determining which title is ""objectively"" better). To ensure a ""common preference,"" we conduct multiple quality checks  and verifications during annotation, where each sample is reviewed by different annotators to reach an agreement (Line 165). We will clarify this in our revised version.\n\n> The dataset consists of only three hundreds of comics\n\nPlease see the Overall Response, point 1.\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juxtaposition\n\n---\n### W3 & Q1: Regarding bias and subjectivity in annotation\n\n> The annotation process might introduce bias and how did you address the subjectivity\n\nPlease see the Overall Response, point 2.\n\n> Did you measure inter-annotator agreement\n\nAs each component was annotated and verified by at least three annotators to reach agreement, we did not further measure inter-annotator agreement.\n\n---\n### W4 & Q4: Regarding the weakness and question of evaluation metrics\n\nPlease see the Overall Response, point 3.\n\n---\n### Q2: Regarding the quality of negative titles and philosophies\n\n> How did you ensure that the negative titles and philosophies were sufficiently challenging yet distinct from the correct ones\n\nThank you for raising this important question! The negative titles and philosophies are constructed by human annotators. For each sample, we first prompt GPT-4 to generate negative candidate options (as shown in Table 4). The annotators then revise and edit these options to **ensure they are sufficiently challenging yet distinct from the correct ones**. During the quality check stage, annotators will further verify the quality. As illustrated in Figure 7, all negative options are on-topic and relevant to the comic but may contain incorrect logic or do not accurately reflect the narrative. This process ensures quality of the negative options.\n\n\n> The negative title ""Graphs Don\'t Lie, People Do"" in the example of Figure 2\n\nThis is a very good point! The comic itself illustrates how the interpretation and presentation of data can be manipulated or selectively used to tell misleading stories, while the **graphs and data are factual and real**. Therefore, the title implying that people lie is not appropriate.\n\n---\n### Q3: Regarding the question of cultural or context bias\n\nThis is a very insightful question! In our current study, the annotations are based on  the **common interpretation** of humor, and our evaluations focus on how model performance aligns with such **average preferences**, without consideration of specific contextual or cultural information. However, we acknowledge the critical importance of considering cultural and contextual variations in humor understanding. We will explore this aspect in our future research. Additionally, we will include a discussion of these considerations in the Limitations section of our revised version.\n\n\n---\n### Regarding the raised ethical consideration\n\nThank you for highlighting these important concerns. To address them, we have included a comprehensive ethics statement in our paper (Section A in appendix). Below we outline the key points:\n\n> Data privacy, copyright, and consent\n\nAll data samples are sourced from publicly available content on social media platforms. We strictly adhere to copyright laws by using original links to the comics, thereby avoiding any infringement. We will provide the original links of each image when releasing the benchmark. \n\n> Discrimination, bias, and fairness\n\nWe have conducted a thorough review and rigorous quality checks of our samples to filter out potentially offensive or harmful content. Our annotators come from diverse cultural and gender backgrounds, and we conduct multiple quality checks and verification to minimize bias. \n\nWe will revise our paper to better clarify these points and provide reassurance regarding the ethical considerations of our work. We will also incorporate more detailed instructions to guide users in adhering to copyright regulations, and encourage users to carefully consider the ethical implications of the generated outputs.'}}, 'id': 'J7sbwGbDxR', 'forum': 'bCMpdaQCNW', 'replyto': 'ldooAv2LYj', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723017564435, 'cdate': 1723017564435, 'tmdate': 1730884018620, 'mdate': 1730884018620, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""## Overall Response to All Reviewers\n\nWe thank all reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions. We are pleased to know that the reviewers consider our benchmark **novel** (reviewer wVUt, yTj4) and **innovative** (reviewer 2fnt), with a **rigorous** human-AI collaborative annotation process (reviewer 2fnt, yTj4). We are also excited to learn that our results and analyses are considered as **comprehensive** (reviewer aFj6), **insightful** (reviewer 2fnt, yTj4), and is **beneficial** for future research (reviewer aFj6). We also thank reviewer aFj6 and yTj4 for considering our paper **clearly written** and **well presented**.\n\nBelow we address some common concerns shared by the reviewers. \n\n### 1. Regarding data size\n\nWe acknowledge the relatively small size of our benchmark due to the challenges and costs associated with data collection and annotation. However, as a benchmark for a novel task, we have rigorously collected and annotated each comic to ensure high quality and reliability. Despite its size, YESBUT covers a broad range of domains and topics (please see our additional analysis on topic coverage in the attached PDF). We believe it serves as a pioneering benchmark to enhance future research in this area.\n\nMeanwhile, we are committed to updating our benchmark with more samples and additional narrative logic types beyond contradictions. We will also explore synthesizing comics using image generation models in future work.\n\n\n\n### 2. Regarding potential bias and subjectivity of annotation\n\nOur benchmark focuses on **common interpretation** of humor. However, we recognize that the subjectivity of this task may introduce bias. To mitigate this issue, we have taken several steps in our annotation process: \n \n1. Diverse Annotator Backgrounds: Our annotators come from different genders and diverse cultural backgrounds, including North America and East Asia, providing a range of perspectives. This diversity helps to mitigate cultural and gender biases in humor interpretation.\n\n2. Consensus Among Annotators: The annotation process incorporates multiple quality checks and verifications to ensure consensus among different annotators. Any comics with controversy and potential bias are filtered out. During the cross verification stages, annotations identified as biased by any annotator are properly modified. This process helps reduce biases stemming from individual perspectives.\n\n3. Verification with Social Media Comments: We also verify our annotations by checking the comments on social media for each comic. This step ensures that our annotations align with the common interpretation of the comic.\n\nAdditionally, we recognize that subjectivity is an inherent aspect of data annotation, especially for more open-ended components such as title and philosophy. Therefore, we frame these two tasks as **selection tasks**, ensuring *the correct option is “objectively” better than the negative options*. Despite these efforts, we acknowledge that our annotations may still carry inherent biases. We will further clarify this and discuss the potential biases in the Limitation section for better guidance of future usage of our benchmark.\n\n\n### 3. Regarding the evaluation metrics of generation tasks\n\nEvaluations of text generation tasks remain challenging and current automatic metrics are not perfect. Therefore, we try to mitigate this challenge from several aspects:\n\n1. Task formalization: We have strategically chosen to formalize **literal description and contradiction generation** as text generation tasks because they are **less open-ended** and more focused on specific descriptions and narrative illustrations of the comic. For the more abstract and subjective components, such as underlying philosophy and title selection, we formulated them as **selection tasks** (i.e., determining which option is “objectively” better), and evaluated these using straightforward accuracy metrics.\n\n2. Evaluation metrics: For semantic-based evaluation, we report **recall scores** to measure how many key points of the reference are captured by the model. This ensures a more precise assessment of content coverage. Additionally, we employ a GPT-based metric alongside a gold standard reference, an approach that has shown strong alignment with human judgment in previous studies [1,2,3].\n\n3. Human Evaluations: We incorporate human evaluations to provide a comprehensive assessment of model output quality. This human judgement helps to capture the nuances that automatic metrics might miss, especially in understanding complex and abstract content like humor.\n\nWe will revise our paper to better clarify these points and provide a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations of automatic evaluations in NLG. Despite the inherent challenges, we believe our multifaceted evaluation approach provides a more balanced and comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.\n\n[1] Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena \\\n[2] CLAIR: Evaluating image captions with large language models. \\\n[3] Geval: NLG evaluation using gpt-4 with better human alignment.\n\n--------\n\nWe also provide a one-page pdf that includes the additional analysis on the following content:\n\n(1) Analysis on the diversity of comic scenarios covered by our benchmark.\n\n(2) The results of human performance compared with VLMs on 50 randomly sampled comics.\n\n\nOnce again, we appreciate all reviewers for your insightful comments and valuable suggestions. We will revise our paper to clarify the unclear parts and incorporate the suggestions. If our responses have addressed your concerns, please kindly consider increasing your scores. We sincerely appreciate your consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAuthors""}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/6950b22779b15e8b57828d60da502bd00618355d.pdf'}}, 'id': 'A5zeysqyqI', 'forum': 'bCMpdaQCNW', 'replyto': 'bCMpdaQCNW', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18748/-/Author_Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723017390440, 'cdate': 1723017390440, 'tmdate': 1730888364138, 'mdate': 1730888364138, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'This paper investigates the capability of large vision language models (VLMs) to understand humor in comics through narrative contradictions.

This narrow focus limits the benchmark’s utility in evaluating general AI capabilities in humor comprehension. The task of matching comics with titles involves a high degree of subjectivity.

Existing work focused on improved one-shot quantization techniques and weight representations; yet, purely post-training  approaches are reaching diminishing returns in terms of the accuracy-vs-bit-width trade-off. State-of-the-art quantization methods such as QuIP# and AQLM include fine-tuning (part of) the compressed parameters over a limited amount of calibration data; however, such fine-tuning techniques over compressed weights often make exclusive use of straight-through estimators (STE), whose performance is not well-understood in this setting. In this work, we question the use of STE for extreme LLM compression, showing that it can be sub-optimal, and perform a systematic study of quantization-aware fine-tuning strategies for LLMs.We propose PV-Tuning - a representation-agnostic framework that generalizes and improves upon existing fine-tuning strategies, and provides convergence guarantees in restricted cases.On the practical side, when used for 1-2 bit vector quantization, PV-Tuning outperforms prior techniques for highly-performant models such as Llama and Mistral.

Is the ""naive solution"" that searches over all combinations cheap enough to do here?\n\nIn general (for VQ), we do an exhaustive search for each code in the chosen subspace, but **not all combinations**. This is because our Linearized V step (Section 3.2) minimizes mean squared error with the adjusted weight matrix (Equation 5). This problem can be solved independently for each discrete code because the optimization objective is a sum over independently chosen discrete weights.\n\nStill, this can be a costly procedure for LLMs with billions of parameters. However, it *becomes cheap since we only update a small fraction of codes*, i.e. the subspace. Thus, we run this costly optimization (1) for less than 1% of all weights and (2) in parallel on GPUs, making it practically feasible.\n\nIn the supplementary code, the discrete optimization takes less than 10% of the total training time when running on A100s.

Non-uniform scalar quantization was chosen for illustration as a non-trivial example with multiple continuous (1-d codebooks, locations of the quantization points) and discrete (1-d codes, codebook assignments) parameters, being at the same time simpler than multidimensional quantization. PV framework can be easily extended to various quantization formats. Specifically, for symmetric uniform scalar quantization there is only a single continuous parameter (P) - quantization scale and discrete parameters (V) are the integers on a line segment. For vector quantization, continuous parameters (P) form a set of vectors (codebooks), and discrete parameters (V) are the indices corresponding to a vector from the codebook. \n\n> (Experimental Evaluation) Better experimental evaluation is needed to understand the real utility of the proposed approach. To be precise, the experiments in Table 2 compare PV tuning with PTQ techniques. But it is well known that QAT outperforms PTQ techniques. So, a better baseline to compare in Table 2 is QAT using STE (or other state of the art QAT techniques).\n\nWe provide a comparison with QAT methods based on STE and Stochastic Rounding in Table 1, Section 4.2. PV-tuning outperforms STE for all quantization methods considered (GPTQ, VQ, AQLM). Therefore, in the following comparison in Table 2 we adopted PV-tuning as the most performant fine-tuning strategy and focused on comparing against established baselines. However, if the reviewer sees a better way to arrange these results, we will welcome their suggestion (through an update on openreview).\n> (Related Work) Uniform quantization, as done by GPTQ and QuIP, has been well studied in the literature. And several QAT techniques that improve upon STE have been developed for uniform quantization (packages such as Pytorch, JAX, TF have really good implementations of QAT for uniform quantization). It's a bit surprising that none of these works are discussed in the paper.\n\nWe agree with the concern and will update Section 2 to discuss these techniques, such as  [1, 2,3,4] and other works. To the best of our knowledge, PyTorch and TF use vanilla STE in their QAT implementation, which we have already compare against. We will investigate this further for the final version.\n\nQuestions\n\n> (Q1) It would be great if the authors can provide some explanation for why PV tuning outperforms STE for uniform quantization. For the case of uniform quantization, it looks like PV tuning does some form of alternating minimization for learning the scale parameters and the quantized weights. In contrast, STE jointly optimizes for both scale parameters and quantized weights. Intuitively, shouldn't joint optimization perform better than alternating optimization?\n\nWe do our best to explain this below and will incorporate this in the final version of the paper. When comparing linearized subspace PV (our practical algorithm) and STE, the main difference is that STE tries to update all weights on every step, whereas our algorithm only updates a chosen subset. We explain why updating all weights is problematic in L192-204. In L218-221 and Appendix G, we explain how choosing a subset of weights helps with discrete optimization. In practice, STE can improve the model during the first steps, but eventually diverges without reaching the optimal solution. Furthermore, as we describe in 787-788, PV-tuning can also do P and V steps simultaneously.\n\n> (Q2) It looks like PV tuning only updates a few coordinates in each iteration. Doesn't this slow down the convergence of the algorithm and increase the training cost (for each backprop we would be updating very few coordinates)?\n\nThe V step in PV-tuning performs large updates on the discrete parameters. Constraining updates to a subset of parameters is necessary for stable convergence of the algorithm. Nevertheless, PV-tuning with part of the parameters updated exhibits steadier and faster convergence compared to STE\n\n> (Q3)If tau is set dynamically (as described in line 304), wouldn't it hurt the performance of optimizers like Adam which maintain coordinate-wise gradient statistics?\n\nWe agree that updating a varying fraction of hyperparameters on each step makes the optimization problem more intricate. However, the preconditioning used in Adam and similar preconditioned gradient descent method is only a coarse approximation of a true curvature, thus the performance could be quite robust to inaccuracies in preconditioner estimates.\n\n> (Q4)It looks like in experiments, STE is applied on top of PV-tuning. But this algorithm is never described in the paper. It would be great if the authors can provide some details about this algorithm?\n\nPV-tuning is proposed as an alternative to STE for continuous and discrete optimization. In Table 1 we provide a comparison between PV-tuning and STE and show that PV-tuning outperforms STE.\n\n\n[1] Zhou, Shuchang, et al. (2016), arXiv:1606.06160\n\n[2] Chen, S. et al.

PV-tuning is positioned between PTQ (post training quantization) methods (which do everything in one-shot on a small amount of data) and QAT (quantization-aware training) methods (which can require even more significant amounts of data and computation): we use little data, but need to be able to fine-tune full blocks or even the entire model. The improved accuracy should offset this additional cost.  \n\nYet, we stress that the runtime of the finetuning procedure is still negligible relative to LLM training. Specifically, PV-tuning of Llama-2-7b and Llama-2-70b on a single machine with 8 A100 GPUs took 90 hours and 171 hours, respectively (the 70b model was trained with a smaller number of iterations). This amounts to ~1000 gpu-hours.  While this is not negligible, our fine-tuning time is still orders of magnitude smaller than the time it took to train the model: for instance, training Llama-2-7b and Llama-2-70b model took 184’320 hours and 1’720’320 gpu-hours, respectively [3, 4].\n\n> (W2) The authors claim that STE-based optimization is not well justified and leads to poor practical performance. However, I am aware of a paper [1] that provided the theoretical justification for STE approach.\n\nThe referenced work presents important insights about the application of STE to the training algorithm, together with the set of prescriptions for a proper choice of the STE. However, we believe that the setup in [1]  is very different from the one considered in our paper. Firstly, **this work applies STE for non-differentiable activations, rather than quantized model weights**. Moreover, their experiments are done on small scale networks and datasets (small MLPs and CNNs on MNIST/CIFAR10) and the conclusion may not transfer to LLMs and large datasets. There are, however, works that study the STE applied to weight quantization, such as [1, 2]: these works found that the standard (deterministic) STE does not converge to the optimum and propose alternatives that do converge, but introduce noise similar to the stochastic rounding that we evaluate in Section 4.2 (see Appendix F for details).\n\n> In my view, the PV algorithm seems similar to alternating minimization. Is there a connection between these two algorithms? \n\nYes, the PV-Tuning algorithm can be seen as a particular case of alternating minimization / coordinate descent, where one alternates between optimization of discrete and continuous parameters.\n\n> Why is the P step an unconstrained minimization problem, as there is a constraint $P(y) \\subseteq P(x)$?\n\nWe meant that the optimization problem for P-step can be reparameterized as an unconstrained optimization problem on the $c$ unique values in the weight matrix. From a practical viewpoint, we declare the $c$ “clusters” or codebooks as an optimized variable, and use an automated differentiation engine (i.e. PyTorch) to minimize the loss as a function of these values. We will clarify this in (L161) in the next revision of the paper.\n\n> Is the linearized V step described in section 3.2 equivalent to projected gradient descent? What is the computational cost to compute the projection onto {$x: V(y) \\subseteq V(x)$} in the V step?\n\nThere is indeed some similarity to the projected gradient descent, applied to a discrete space of quantization codes. In this interpretation, the projection operation is finding the nearest quantized value (in terms of L2) out of a fixed-size set. For non-vector quantization (e.g. GPTQ in Section 4.2), this projection is done by simple rounding, which is a constant time per weight, after accounting for the quantization scale and zero point (see L294). As for the vector quantization, the projection is done by searching the set of all vectors in the current quantization “codebook” (L295-296). Note that this projection is only computed for a small fraction of weights in the current subspace (Section 3.3).\n\n[1] A. Shekhovtsov and V. Yanush.

While there are some theorems, they do not appear to be very useful (e.g. 3.1 just claims that PV tuning converges, but without any statements on how good the final solution is or any bounds on error). Perhaps I am misunderstanding the paper completely, so it would be useful for the authors to give a TLDR version of the actual method.\n\nWhile our main results are practical, we agree that our theoretical results can be presented more clearly, and we will do our best to improve presentation. For instance, Theorem 3.1 proves that PV-Tuning converges to a stable solution in order to contrast our method against Straight Through Estimation and Stochastic Rounding, both of which lack this property. We agree that proving tight convergence bounds would be valuable, but it is difficult to prove such bounds for our mixed continuous-discrete optimization problem–intuitively, the additional constraints make the problems “harder” than standard convex/non-convex optimization. We see this as an important direction for future work.\n\n> (W2) How large is the subspace for the CD step? Iterating through all possible code assignment changes is exponential in the subspace size, so how do you perform the code assignment optimization in a tractable way?\n\nThe size of the subspace $\\tau$ is such that the update satisfies  $\\|x^{k+1} - x^k\\| / \\|x^k\\| \\leq 0.01$, also known as the trust ratio (see Section 3.3). We choose this subspace using a simple heuristic: we select $\\tau$ parameters with the largest gradient of the original loss function. Further details can be found in Section 3.4. In practice, choosing the subspace takes negligible time, compared to accumulating the gradients w.r.t. LLM parameters.\n\n\n> (W3) The empirical results presented are based on the AQLM quantization method. One main benefit of quantizing LLMs is to achieve speedups in memory bound scenarios. However, the AQLM configuration used for PV tuning is too slow for fast inference\n\nWe have also presented results for, e.g. the GPTQ format in our paper, although we indeed focused primarily on AQLM as it is one of the best methods in terms of model size vs accuracy. Fortunately, VQ and AQLM still offer speedups in memory-bound scenarios. We discuss this briefly in L334-337 and report speedups in Appendix M.\n\n> (W3) Do you have any experiments showing this? QuIP# is based off of GPTQ which performs poorly on Llama 3, does PV tuning fix this if applied to QuIP# after GPTQ?\n\n\nWe have chosen AQLM over QuIP# because it outperformed the latter in WikiText2 perplexity (fig. 2). We have looked into integrating with QuIP#’s code base, but, due to its complexity, we are afraid that it won’t be possible to evaluate QuIP#’s performance with PV-tuning due to the rebuttal’s time constraints. We will try to add results in this direction for the next revision. \n\n> (W4) The result tables with numbers reported in the baselines, and some of the baseline results in 4.1 seemed a bit suspicious. Please check that your numbers are indeed correct.\n\nWe would appreciate it if the reviewer could make this concern more specific. Below we respond based on our best guess about what the review refers to.\n\nThere are two important causes why baseline numbers may seem odd. First, some of the baseline papers, notably [1] use a different way of computing the perplexity score, which is not compatible with most prior works. To compare these approaches, we reevaluated the methods from that paper using their official code. Second, for every paper that uses a different dataset or less data, we reevaluated these methods with the same sample of RedPajama we used (excluding OneBit, see L874-879). Please see Appendices J and L for a detailed experimental configuration. We verify all numbers that we report as a standard procedure, and will verify them again in the final revision.\n\n\n\n> (W4) The pareto optimality claim is also questionable, since the ""frontier"" is just for PV. A better comparison would be PV tuning @ 2 bits vs FP16 @ 3 bits, and it doesn\'t seem (although I didn\'t plot this) that PV tuning is actually better at 2 bits than FP16 at 3 bits.\n\nWe use the same method for evaluating pareto optimality as in [2], the same method is used in follow-up works. Unfortunately, we don’t understand what “FP16 @ 3 bits” stands for. We encourage the reviewer to clarify their suggestion (e.g. by editing their review) so we can apply it in the final version of the paper.\n\n\n[1] Huang, W., et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.14047 (2024).\n\n[2] Dettmers, T., Zettlemoyer L. arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.09720 (2022).'}}, 'id': 'CNAp4gDDES', 'forum': 'YvA8UF0I37', 'replyto': 'kefQ5K30nd', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6508/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6508/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6508/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723024360695, 'cdate': 1723024360695, 'tmdate': 1730881572357, 'mdate': 1730881572357, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We are glad that the reviewer appreciates our technical contribution and extensive experiments.

It would be beneficial to include such a comparison for clarity.\n\nCurrently, we describe each of these approaches in appendices E and F respectively (L676–717), but we do not compare them directly in terms of the underlying principles and specific implementations.\n\nTo address this concern, we will add a dedicated comparison between these two strategies and PV-tuning. More specifically, we will highlight the additional memory requirements of STE and PV-tuning, compared to stochastic rounding, and the effects of the stochastic rounding noise on the optimization. As for the experimental differences, we compared PV-Tuning vs the two other baseline strategies in Section 4.2. We would welcome further suggestions for comparisons.\n\n> (W2) Some notations in the paper may be confusing. In part 3.1, the expression “$P(y) \\supseteq P(x)$” is used but it does not mean that P(x) is a subset of P(y), which is confusing because the $\\supseteq$ symbol usually means to include. Also in this part, it would be clear if there are some simple examples.\n\nWe do our best to formally define our notation, e.g. we explain the meaning of “$P(y) \\supseteq P(x)$” in L127-128. However, we agree that it would be better to avoid collision with existing set notation and will do so in the next revision. We currently consider changing this to $\\sqsupseteq$, but we would welcome additional suggestions. In the next revision of the paper we will also add examples that demonstrate this relation.\n\n> (Q1) In the experiment part, besides the PPL and accuracy, is there any evidence that supports the STE is noisier than PV-Tuning? It would be more convincing if the paper could provide some experimental evidence.\n\nIn preliminary experiments we observed that training STE results in model diverging after a certain number of steps, with point of divergence varying with random seed.

Does this mean that subspace is the key to performance improvement? Can you combine subspace and STE to conduct some ablation experiments?\n\nIndeed, the subspace optimization during V step is the key to our performance improvements. From a practitioner’s standpoint, we introduce the general PV framework in order to show why and how subspace descent during V step can help with the optimization.

Below, we do our best to address concerns and answer questions raised in the review.\n\n> (W1) What does “one shot” imply? Does it refer to layer-wise quantization?\n\nIndeed, in L37-38, one-shot quantization refers to the family of quantization algorithms that compress the model in a single layer-by-layer pass over the model, without fine-tuning. Typically, this is done through the use of advanced quantized representations. This includes layerwise quantization algorithms such as GPTQ [1], SPQR [2], or QUIP [3], among others, and is contrasted to algorithms that fine-tune the entire model or a subset of the layers, such as OmniQuant [4], QuIP#[5] or AQLM[6]. \n\n> (W1) Conversely, what does the authors\' claim of ""fine-tuning layer-wise"" mean? \n\nThis refers to a type of algorithm that fine-tunes every transformer block individually, relative to the outputs of the original model, to minimize MSE between original and quantized outputs. This technique is implemented in, e.g., AQLM [6] and QUIP# [5].\n\n> (W1) As I understand, quantization typically uses a small calibration set, yet the authors have utilized the entire RedPajama for calibration in section 4.1.\n\nWe believe there is a misunderstanding: as we describe in the dataset configuration (Appendix H, referenced in L243), **we use not the entire RedPajama dataset, but a small sample (0.1%) for that dataset**. Thus, we use a similar amount of calibration data to prior popular quantization techniques, such as AQLM and QuIP#.\n\nWe agree that some of these terms (e.g. “one-shot”) and details can be described more accurately. We will rewrite L37-38 and L243 to make our setup easier to follow.\n\n> (W2) Figure 2 should compare the effects of each method with and without fine-tuning; the current Figure 2 middle and right do not directly facilitate this comparison.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We conducted additional experiments for some of the missing methods (e.g. GPTQ) and reported all results in **Table 1 and Figure 1** in the attached PDF. Note that one of the algorithms (SpQR) is still missing since the algorithm’s codebase requires additional work to incorporate proper finetuning. We will rectify this by the final version of the paper.\n\nIn the next revision, we will improve Figure 2 to make it easier to compare each of these methods with and without finetuning.\n\n> (W2) The authors should not only select quantized representations from different methods for fine-tuning but also apply different fine-tuning strategies, including STE, PV-tuning, GPTQ, etc., to demonstrate the advantages of PV-tuning.\n\nWe compare different fine-tuning strategies, including STE, PV-tuning, stochastic rounding and some of their combinations, in Section 4.2, Table 1. We apply each of these strategies to both GPTQ, VQ and AQLM to better understand their behavior for different representations. If you have any further suggestions to improve this analysis, we would be happy to apply them.\n\n> (W3) In Table 2, PV-tuning indeed shows a significant effect. However, I am uncertain whether this is due to PV-tuning using more data (RedPajama) or because it is inherently more effective. Did the authors use the same calibration data for different methods in this experiment?\n\nPV-Tuning only trains on a small sample of the RedPajama data, similarly to the baselines.\nWe use an official sample of the RedPajama dataset and compare algorithms in equal conditions, with a few exceptions. Specifically, all algorithms except OneBit use samples  from the RedPajama dataset. For some of these algorithms (QuIP# and one-shot algorithms), their implementation cannot handle as much data within 1TB RAM due to storing activations in memory. For these algorithms, we used the largest possible dataset size and tested that the algorithm reaches saturation (i.e. adding data does not improve accuracy). Finally, the OneBit baseline uses a custom dataset described in its original paper. This is because the code for that specific algorithm was not available at the time and we had to use the existing results. We describe these details further in appendices H and L.\n\n> (Q1) If we need to perform large-scale fine-tuning to achieve model quantization, why not maintain full precision during this large-scale fine-tuning and only apply low-precision quantization techniques after full precision fine-tuning?\n\nQuantized fine-tuning works because it allows layers to adjust each other’s quantization errors. In contrast, fine-tuning an uncompressed model in full precision (e.g. by cross-entropy) may improve general model quality, but it does not compensate for the quantization error. Note that finetuning is much shorter than pretraining of the original model. \n\nTo better demonstrate the difference between the two strategies, we run an additional experiment where we fine-tune the model in full precision and quantize it afterward. For this experiment, we substitute the KL divergence loss with cross-entropy on the data. This is because the KL divergence between two identical full precision models is always zero. We run this experiment with the Llama 2 7B model using 2-bit vector quantization in the same setup as in Section 4.3, and then quantize the model in one shot using AQLM. The results in Table 2 (PDF) show that this achieves some improvement over AQLM, but PV-Tuning still significantly outperforms this baseline. We hypothesize that the advantage of PV-Tuning is explained by the quantization error compensation during fine-tuning.\n\n[1] Frantar, E., et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.17323 (2023).\n\n[2] Dettmers, T., et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.03078 (2023).\n\n[3] Chee, J., et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.13304 (2024).\n\n[4] Shao, W., et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.13137 (2024).\n\n[5] Tseng, A., et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.04396 (2024).\n\n[6] Egiazarian, V., et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.06118 (2024).'}}, 'id': 'mm5k04xlo9', 'forum': 'YvA8UF0I37', 'replyto': 'uRvbLgfdT5', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6508/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6508/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6508/Official_Review5/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723024170183, 'cdate': 1723024170183, 'tmdate': 1730881572666, 'mdate': 1730881572666, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'The paper proposes the use of fine-tuning over highly-compressed models to achieve better model compression.

The paper also mentioned PV tuning could be applied to QuIP#, which does achieve near memory bandwidth. Do you have any experiments showing this?

Recent work utilizes plan-and-solve decomposition to decrease the complexity and leverage self-tests to refine the generated program. Yet, planning deep-inside requirements in advance can be challenging, and the tests need to be accurate to accomplish self-improvement. To this end, we propose FunCoder, a code generation framework incorporating the divide-and-conquer strategy with functional consensus. Specifically, FunCoder recursively branches off sub-functions as smaller goals during code generation, represented by a tree hierarchy. These sub-functions are then composited to attain more complex objectives. Additionally, we designate functions via a consensus formed by identifying similarities in program behavior, mitigating error propagation. FunCoder outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +9.8% on average in HumanEval, MBPP, xCodeEval and MATH with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moreover, our method demonstrates superiority on smaller models: With FunCoder, StableCode-3b surpasses GPT-3.5 by +18.6% and achieves 97.7% of GPT-4's performance on HumanEval. Further analysis reveals that our proposed dynamic function decomposition is capable of handling complex requirements, and the functional consensus prevails over self-testing in correctness evaluation.",Oral Session 3D: Natural Language Processing,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=cFqAANINgW,https://openreview.net/forum?id=cFqAANINgW,cFqAANINgW,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'This paper introduces FunCoder, an elegant divide-and-conquer strategy for code generation which uses an LLM to recursively decompose a complex programming task into a tree of functions calling helper functions. Because the units of decomposition are individual code functions, FunCoder also uses the notion of functional consensus to select good helper function implementations before completing the implementation of the parent function. These techniques lead to significant improvements in multiple code generation and math reasoning benchmarks.\n\nI recommend to **accept** this paper because, in my opinion, this is a great paper with many strengths:\n* The topic of LLM-based code generation for complex tasks is clearly important.\n* Reviewers agreed that FunCoder is ""conceptually very clean"", ""novel and beautiful"", and ""well explained and motivated"".\n* Reviewers also praised the ""extensive experiments"" and their ""striking"" results: ""Besides outperforming SOTA baselines, ... it is impressive how FunCoder significantly improve the small LLMs\' performance.""\n* Beyond the impressive end-to-end results, the authors dive deeper to better understand the method and explain its benefits compared to prior approaches. In this way, the paper ""justif[ies] different design choices"" and ""provides a number of interesting insights beyond the base experimental results"".\n* The paper\'s writing is ""commendably clear"". In fact, I think a reader can understand the main divide-and-conquer idea from only Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n* The authors provided detailed rebuttals containing clarifications, further analyses, and new experimental results. These rebuttals strengthened the paper\'s conclusions and improved the reviewers\' opinions of the work.\n* After discussions, all reviewers are supportive of accepting this paper.\n\nMost weaknesses raised by reviewers were addressed by the rebuttals, but a minor weakness remains: the method is not evaluated on realistic complex programming tasks, despite being designed for complex tasks. A full experiment is a lot to ask for given the paper\'s broad scope already, but I think it would be very enlightening to include a small case study on 1-3 carefully-chosen realistic complex tasks (chosen based on the needs/strengths of FunCoder and simplifying assumptions like being contained in one file, not cherrypicked post-hoc based on results).\n\nI also think this paper should be highlighted (more than a poster) because its ideas are intuitive, elegant, and broadly applicable. Decomposition in program synthesis is not a new subject, but the divide-and-conquer strategy proposed in this paper is a novel and conceptually simple approach that seems generally applicable to more languages and programming domains than explored by the paper. The concept of functional consensus is also a refreshing alternative to clustering of function behavior (majority voting) or self-testing (like CodeT). I anticipate that the core ideas in this paper could be easily communicated to and appreciated by a broader audience without requiring much prerequisite knowledge, another reason for this paper being well-suited for an oral presentation.\n\n---\n\nI also want to share some thoughts with the authors, in case it helps improve a future version of the paper. Your rebuttal includes an example illustrating why functional consensus works. Here is an additional explanation which may be more intuitive.\n\nFunctional consensus reminds me of ""special-case similarity"" from the FrAngel paper (Section 4.1 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05175). In short, this is a common property where a fully-correct program is similar to other (simpler) programs that only solve a subset of the desired functionality (a ""special case""). The FrAngel paper found success in program synthesis search by remembering the simplest program generated so far which solves each different subset of tests, and biasing generation of future programs toward the set of remembered programs. This works if enough remembered programs contain sufficient similarity to a fully-correct solution to increase the chances of progress.\n\nBringing this back to functional consensus, a possible explanation for its effectiveness is as follows. Consider a correct solution program which has multiple ""special-case programs"" which are partially correct in different ways, for example:\n\n* a program that behaves correctly in the general case but misses an edge case\n* a program that handles the edge case correctly but messes up the general case\n* a buggy program that behaves correctly for all tests that don\'t trigger the bug\n* a program which replaces an if/else block with just the body of the else, which still behaves correctly for the subset of tests where the condition evaluates to false\n* a program with a mix of the above properties\n\nIf we had a pool of programs containing the fully-correct program along with multiple special-case programs such as those listed above, then we would expect:\n\n* the fully-correct program would be similar (in behavior on tests) to every other special-case program\n* each special-case program would be similar to other special-case programs only to the extent that the special cases themselves overlap, which is less than the amount of overlap with the fully-correct program\n\nSo, intuitively we would expect that the fully-correct program is selected by functional consensus.\n\nIt may also be interesting to weight each test by how much it\'s able to distinguish between different sampled programs, considering the other tests as well. For example, the first test that exercises some edge case is really helpful in identifying programs that handle that edge case correctly. But further tests for the same edge case may not provide any additional ""distinguishing power"". Should an edge case have more impact on functional similarity simply because it has more tests? A correct program must handle the edge case correctly, no matter how many tests illustrate that edge case. But, perhaps failing a rare edge case is more acceptable than failing a common edge case. The right decision might depend on how exactly the tests are generated.'}}, 'id': '0lpGiIX8ja', 'forum': 'cFqAANINgW', 'replyto': 'cFqAANINgW', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Program_Chairs'], 'nonreaders': [], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Program_Chairs'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/-/Decision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1727277611259, 'cdate': 1727277611259, 'tmdate': 1730885610078, 'mdate': 1730885610078, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': ""We thank you for your response and again apologize for causing confusion regarding our code.\n\nTo put it honestly, we were quite busy with other things on our hands, so didn't have enough time to polish our code.

Probably the only way to address it right now is to add program contracts via human experts (for example, contracts are added manually in the EvalPlus paper for test-case reliability) or LLMs; some weak pre-condition is also better than nothing even if they cannot be strictly verified.\n\nI'm happy to increase by rating to 6.""}}, 'id': '5KJRs3y53I', 'forum': 'cFqAANINgW', 'replyto': 'fdce9KXeV3', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Reviewer_Ar6t'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Reviewer_Ar6t'], 'number': 5, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723424024859, 'cdate': 1723424024859, 'tmdate': 1730890073895, 'mdate': 1730890073895, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for your detailed response.\nI am generally satisfied with the clarifications provided; however, I have reservations regarding point 3. \nTraditional LLMs just generate the whole code.\nYour techniques are generated in a divide-conquer way, which means the LLM needs to understand the code dependency and generate multiple times for each sub-problem considering the context.\nThe sub-problems may be easier than the origin problems, which means the overall success rate (94.5) and the success rate for sub-problems (97.2) would be different.\nMore complex problems require higher accuracy on sub-problems (~100%).\nDoes that mean that in your experiment, for simple sub-problems, the LLM can reach almost 100% accuracy?\n\nAdditional experiments could be highly beneficial to solidify the claims of your technique’s effectiveness.

The analysis of token cost appears to assume an ideal scenario where no failures occur.**\n\nIndeed, in the analysis of general response, we simplified the situations and ignored the the situations where the LLMs make a mistake. However, in token cost results (Table 3, 11 and in our response) we have **always included** token usage for retries to ensure fair comparison, and we argue that this situation may be trivial to consider.\n\nFailures that cause retries can rarely happen in FunCoder -- they happen if and only if no code can be extracted from the responses' Markdown blocks, or that the code was syntactically incorrect. We provide additional statistic results in the table below, which shows a relatively low failure rate even in complex questions (MATH or xCodeEval).\n\n| Dataset | Pass@1 | failed to parse / all LLM calls |\n|---|---|---|\n| HumanEval | 85.4 | 0.10% |\n| MBPP | 78.5 | 0.31% |\n| xCodeEval | 31.4 | 1.68% |\n| MATH | 54.0 | 2.10% |\n\n> **2.

Then, your success rate to derive b->B and c->C should be increased to the square root of 0.945, which means 0.972. When the program becomes much more complex, the requirement of success rate for each divided subprogram is further increased.**\n\n**Accumulated errors in FunCoder also occur in Standard**, where generating all functions (ABC) all at once would have a higher error rate than generating one at a time (A, B, C).\n\nNote that this metaphor may not be exact since 94.5% acc is an average of all problems, where different problems are decomposed into different depths. However, we follow this metaphor and continue to show why FunCoder works better than other methods. Here success rate of *Standard* on a single function is $\\sqrt{82.9}=91.0$. On a harder dataset where problems are decomposed to 10 levels of functions on average, *Standard*'s overall accuracy will be $91.0^{10}=38.9$, while FunCoder still keeps $97.2^{10}=79.3$.\n\nResults on xCodeEval dataset shows that FunCoder gets greater improvements on harder problems compared to simple problems. But of course, the analysis we just made was based on a simple assumption and does not reflect reality.\n\n> **4. I think there should be some design and cost to increase the performance, even if the divided programs are simpler than the original ones.**\n\nWe designed FunCoder under the consideration of complex problem performance, and have made visible progress. Particularly, our method:\n\n 1. **Divide** dynamically decomposes problems into simpler subproblems, making them easier to solve. The Divide stage always considers just one layer of problem at a time, thus can keep the model in context, reducing ambiguity and complexity caused by extra-long code. For instance, the problem A-B-C-D requires all these functions to be in context in *Standard*, while ours only need 2 for each of the 4 calls.\n 2. **Conquer** enables bottom-up generation through re-composing simple functions into a complex solution to a complex problem. This mitigates the issue where Divide cannot see the subfunctions while generating parent functions, making function dependencies more robust. (Note that LLMs are autoregressive models, so while *Standard* generates ABC, when A is being generated B,C aren't there yet. This could cause *Standard* to mis-invoke B or C from A in this implementation.)\n 3. **Functional consensus** verifies every function starting from the leaves. Through sampling and voting, incidental errors and cascading errors may be reduced and thus the accuracy could be improved. Before our method, self-test was widely used for verifying programs, and now FunCoder manages to achieve higher performance with the same level of token complexity.\n\nWe further note that Divide, Conquer and Consensus may be used together, and that using them in conjunction will further raise the accuracy on complex problems.""}}, 'id': 'PsWYtTbu17', 'forum': 'cFqAANINgW', 'replyto': 'FYVculT8HO', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Authors'], 'number': 3, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723351997309, 'cdate': 1723351997309, 'tmdate': 1730890073989, 'mdate': 1730890073989, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the detailed rebuttal and the efforts made to clarify the cost analysis in your paper.

Analysis of token cost\n\n### 2.1 Example\n\nWe use the example from Figure 1, where the final program consists of 5 functions A[B[D,E],C], and A serves as the entry to the program. We denote $N=A+B+C+D+E$ as the token complexity of this task. The order in which calls are executed is put in a pair of parentheses before each line in the following examples.\n\n**Standard:** Call once only. Completes the given function.\n```\n(1) a -> ABCDE\ninput tokens = a\noutput tokens = A+B+C+D+E\noverall = O(N)\n```\n\n**FunCoder/Divide:** In each step of the *Divide* stage the to-be-implemented function will serve as the context. The function will be implemented and sub-function stubs will be declared.\n```\n(1) a -> Abc\n(2) b -> Bde\n(3) d -> D\n(4) e -> E\n(6) c -> C\ninput tokens = a+b+c+d+e\noutput tokens = A+b+B+c+C+d+D+e+E < 2N\noverall = O(N)\n```\n\n**FunCoder/Conquer:** Here the context includes the current function's definition and finalized implementations of sub-functions. The output is the re-implemented current function.\n```\n(5) bDE -> B\n(7) aBC -> A\ninput tokens = a+b+B+C+D+E < 2N\noutput tokens = A+B\n```\n\n**FunCoder/Consensus:** When sampling (`n=k`) is enabled in the bottom-up process, the *Conquer* stage automatically includes 'consensus'. Here input tokens are still counted once, and output tokens are counted k-times.\n```\n(3) d -> kD\n(4) e -> kE\n(5) bDE -> kB\n(6) c -> kC\n(7) aBC -> kA\ninput tokens = a+b+B+c+C+d+D+e+E < 2N\noutput tokens = kA+kB+kC+kD+kE = kN\noverall = O(kN)\n```\n\n**Conclusion:** The token cost involved in FunCoder and Standard are both worst-case $O(N)$ which linearly scales to the number of final output tokens (i.e. problem's inherent complexity). Even if sampling is applied its complexity $O(kN)$ would still be on par with other methods (e.g. self-consistency, CodeT) where sampling is also enabled.\n\n### 2.2 Complexity of token-cost\n\nWe explain that the worst-case token cost of our method is $O(kN)$. For the sake of simplicity, consider the case without output sampling:\n\n- Suppose that the program will have $N$ tokens.\n- We ignore the tokens involved with prompting since they are generally proportional to the number of LLM calls.\n- The naive 'Standard' method should generate exactly $N$ tokens.\n-  FunCoder goes through the *Divide* stage and the *Conquer* stage for each of the functions. Without loss of generality,\n  - Based on the current function, *Divide* generates an implementation of itself and stubs for sub-functions. In this stage, each function would appear at most once in input and twice in output. All *Divide* stages consume no more than $3N$ tokens.\n  - Recursively generate all sub-functions, and\n  - *Conquer* regenerates the parent function based on its stub and all finalized sub-functions. Here each function will appear at most twice in input and exactly once in output. All *Conquer* stages shall consume at most $3N$ tokens.\n\nSo FunCoder requires no more than $6N$ tokens in input-output, making its token consumption $O(N)$ even at worst-case.\n\nWe further argue that even if output sampling is enabled (`n=k`), this complexity will still be a linear $O(kN)$. This shows that our token complexity is consistent with other sampling-enabled methods like Standard + CodeT.\n\n### 2.3 Detailed result of token cost distribution\n\nWe thank reviewer LV7h and s7Dq for their suggestions on more comprehensive statistics regarding token consumption. We have added minimum-maximum values, median and distribution to the statistics, included in the table below. This further supports the point that our method merely applies a constant factor to the token cost.\n\n| Setting | Pass@1 | min tks | max tks | mean tks | med tks |\n| --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |\n| Standard | 68.3 | 648 | 1477 | 886.7 | 861.5 |\n| One-pass | 72.6 (+4.6) | 826 | 3489 | 1233.7 | 1132.0 |\n| Two-pass | 78.7 (+10.4) | 2197 | 8406 | 3343.2 | 3078.0 |\n| Two-pass + ST@11 | 80.5 (+12.2) | 2967 | 13758 | 5408.3 | 5184.0 |\n| FunCoder@5 | 83.5 (+15.2) | 2455 | 9432 | 4040.9 | 3800.0 |\n| **FunCoder@11** | 85.4 (+17.1) | 3015 | 13850 | 5402.0 | 5166.5 |\n\nThese results will be included in the next revision of our paper.\n\n## 3. Exemplify why Consensus Works\n\nWe thank reviewers 8URc and Ar6t for pointing this out and would like to elaborate further:\n\n- Consider finding all square roots of a float. Generate 10 functions.\n- 4 results know that a positive number has two square roots. 4 results know that a negative number has imaginary square roots. Only 2 results considered both points.\n- Notice that the model gets 60% right for either point independently, but only 20% when the points are put together.\n- With our function similarity, the solution which is on-more-aspects similar (and happens to be correct) will be favored.\n\nThrough this example, we illustrate that Functional Consensus has the potential to identify the correct samples even at their minority, outperforming other methods such as self-consistency or clustering.""}}, 'id': '8fnzuPc7kp', 'forum': 'cFqAANINgW', 'replyto': 'cFqAANINgW', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Authors'], 'number': 2, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/-/Author_Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723003957466, 'cdate': 1723003957466, 'tmdate': 1730888359733, 'mdate': 1730888359733, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""Thank you for your time and effort in reviewing our paper! These are very helpful suggestions and we address your questions here:\n\n> **W1: The sections detailing the approach are somewhat brief, which leaves me wanting a deeper understanding of the full method, especially since the study focuses on employing a divide-and-conquer approach for code generation.**\n\nApologies for any confusion. Due to page constraints, we couldn't describe the complete divide-and-conquer process in detail in the main text. However, we supplemented the Implementation Details in Appendix A.1 and have respective prompts in Appendix C to help understand the model's operation. As described in Algorithm 1, FunCoder is a recursive process following a DFS pattern. We use square brackets [L1] below to denote the line number in Algorithm 1.\n\n- FunCoder [L1], when solving each function $f$, first performs the *Divide* stage [L3-L9], where the LLM initially writes the function and identifies some potential sub-problems, represented as sub-function stubs (e.g., `def f(xs: list[int]) -> int`) [L3]. In this process, we identify the sub-problems of the current problem, thereby understanding the dependency relationship between functions.\n- For each decomposed sub-problem $g_1, g_2, \\ldots$, we recursively use FunCoder to obtain the final implementation $G_i$ for that sub-problem [L5-L8]. This $G_i$ shall replace the previously incomplete subfunction stub signature in the final program.\n  - FunCoder [L1], when solving each function $g_1$, …\n  - FunCoder [L1], when solving each function $g_2$, …\n- Now that all sub-problems of $f$ are implemented, we move on to the *Conquer* stage [L11-13] to complete the larger problem. By combining the signature $f$ and the final implementations $G_i$ of sub-problems, we generate the complete implementation $F$ [L11] and return it [L13].\n\nLet's describe how this algorithm works in detail by combining it with the example given in the lower half of Figure 1.\n\n```py\n[a.1] FunCoder(a)\n│  [a.3] LLM(a) -> A, {b, c}       # divide\n├──[b.1] FunCoder(b)\n│  │  [b.3] LLM(b) -> B, {d, e}    # divide\n│  ├──[d.1] FunCoder(d)\n│  │  │  [d.3] LLM(d) -> D, {}     # divide\n│  │  └──[d.13] return D           # nothing to conquer\n│  ├──[e.1] FunCoder(e)\n│  │  │  [e.3] LLM(e) -> E, {}     # divide\n│  │  └──[e.13] return E           # nothing to conquer\n│  │  [b.11] LLM(B, {D, E}) -> B*  # conquer\n│  └──[b.13] return B*\n├──[c.1] FunCoder(c)\n│  │  [c.3] LLM(c) -> C, {}        # divide\n│  └──[c.13] return C              # nothing to conquer\n│  [a.11] LLM(A, {B, C}) -> A*     # conquer\n└──[a.13] return A*                # final result\n```\n\nWe will add this content to the Appendix to provide a more detailed explanation of our method. Hope this addresses your concerns about our approach.\n\n> **Q1: How the model decide the functions to be further divided or too simple? Any experiment?**\n\nWe rely on the knowledge of code and instruction following capabilities acquired by the LLM during its training. This enables the LLM to make approximate decisions on whether a function should be further decomposed. As stated in Appendix A.1, the LLM is prompted in the divide phase to implement the current function and simultaneously introduce new sub-functions if necessary.\n\nAs shown in Appendix C.2, we designed the *Divide* prompt with a 2-shot example. One example demonstrates that complex problems should be decomposed, while the other example shows that simple problems can be implemented without new sub-functions.\n\nFurthermore, in Table 5, we observed that functions produced in the *Divide* stages are highly domain-specific. These sub-functions are likely to be generated based on knowledge from pre-training data, supporting how LLM can decompose tasks based on pretrained knowledge.\n\n> **Q2: How the conquer works? Does the model aware of the dependency among those sub functions?**\n\nRegarding the complete process of divide-and-conquer, why Conquer works, and whether the model is aware of function dependencies, we have briefly discussed this in response to Weakness 1. Here, we elaborate further:\n\nDuring the *Divide* phase, we extract the hierarchical relationships between functions to construct a dependency tree. *Conquer* merges finished sub-problems, and this is entirely consistent with the principles of divide-and-conquer. In our task, *Conquer* provides the finalized sub-functions in the context and rewrites the parent function based on them. We will make this point clear in future versions.\n\nConquer is indispensable. In the *Divide* phase, the function is generated before the sub-problem definitions, so the details of the sub-problems are not clear at this point. And the invocation of sub-functions or positions from where they are invoked by the parent function might be incorrect. It is therefore necessary to regenerate the function after all sub-functions are finished. In Table 3, we conducted an ablation study on the *Conquer* stage (Two-pass vs. One-pass) and empirically found that enabling Conquer significantly improves the code generation performance.\n> **Q3: What is the cost of each part? What about overall efficiency and resource utilization.**\n\nIn Appendix A.6, Table 11, we listed the token usage of gpt-3.5-turbo for both our method and the baselines. We have also provided further statistics on token usage in our General Response. Upon your request, we have further broken down the token usage for each stage of FunCoder in the following table. Hope this answers your questions.\n\n| Part in FunCoder | mean tks | med tks |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| TOTAL | 5402.0 | 5166.5 |\n| Divide | 1241.0 | 1135.0 |\n| Input generation | 930.9 | 861.5 |\n| Conquer | 3230.2 | 3149.5 |\n\nOur algorithm itself is very lightweight and does not consume much CPU or RAM resources. Resource consumption comes from calling the LLMs. For an overall analysis of token efficiency, please refer to the general response. We will include these in our next revision.""}}, 'id': 'PS80GQZeXV', 'forum': 'cFqAANINgW', 'replyto': 'n8Ezg1AkpU', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722959068944, 'cdate': 1722959068944, 'tmdate': 1730881309423, 'mdate': 1730881309423, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank you for your time and effort in reviewing our paper! We find your suggestions very helpful and we hereby address your questions:\n\n> **W1: The equivalence-modulo-inputs idea requires knowing the accurate input domain and designing corresponding input samplers, which are oversimplified in this paper.**\n\nIt is indeed challenging to *ensure* that LLMs generate reliable and valid inputs. However, in order to verify code correctness using LLMs, there are typically only three major methods:\n\n1. Predict bugs by just reading the code (e.g. self-refine).\n2. Generate unit tests for self-testing (e.g. CodeT).\n3. (Ours) Generate inputs and select the best program based on outputs of sampled programs.\n\nIn our comparisons, we focused more on the widely used unit-test method, which not only has to generate reliable inputs but also provide correct case outputs. If the generated output is incorrect, program verdicts will be deeply impacted. Experiment results in Table 3 empirically show a clear advantage of our method over unit tests.\n\n> **W2: Functionality consensus selects the most common functor candidate, but commonality may not necessarily correlate with correctness in code generation. Correct samples can even be exceptional in sampling when the task is challenging to the LLM.**\n\nImproving performance beyond pre-trained capabilities is hard. While it\'s quite challenging to prove it formally, our consensus still works better than clustering and other methods, as is shown in Table 3. We look forward to future work substantiating this finding.\n\nAdmittedly, commonality is less likely to boost performance on problems beyond the LLMs\' knowledge, but it isn\'t necessarily outperformed by the *Standard* baseline. However, commonality empirically reduces incidental errors, as we exemplified in general response.\n\nRefer to xCodeEval results in Table 1. Although our method yields little improvements on Expert-level problems where LLMs can almost never get right, it happened to perform quite well on Hard-level and easier problems. This can be similarly observed on MATH dataset.\n\n> **W3: The diversity of studied models is a bit limited.

We adapted our approach and found that FunCoder can also achieve good results with StarCoder2-15b, bringing its pass@1 of 59.8 on *Standard* to 78.7 with our method. More promising results can be found in our General Response.\n\n> **W4:  ""A program specifies its functionality (or behavior) through the control flow..."" is not accurate.**\n\nThank you for pointing out this mistake. Indeed, considering only the control flow of a program is incomplete when it comes to behavior. This was an oversight during our writing process. We\'ll correct this in our next revision as ""the program\'s control flow and logic"".\n\n> **Q1: Can you exemplify ""cascading errors"" and explain why sampling multiple functions helps mitigate such errors?**\n\nIn this context, ""cascading errors"" refer to where an error in the sub-function causes the parent function to also fail. For example, a badly implemented \'cosine\' function will cause everything depending on it to malfunction.\n\nAs discussed in W2, sampling implementations on a single function can reduce its incidental errors, so in decomposition it would also reduce overall (cascading) errors in the whole program.\n\n> **Q2: Can the selection of benchmarks really exercise the core part of solving complicated coding tasks?**\n\nFollowing AlphaCode and CodeLLAMA\'s definition of \'complex\' competition-level datasets, we used xCodeEval and MATH in our evaluations. Table 1, 4, 10 show that our method achieves significant improvements on these more difficult problems.\n\nHowever, we fully agree with your concerns regarding complex problems. Due to the scope of our work, we haven\'t yet been able to test our performance on software development tasks, which often involve engineering details like changing requirements, code retrieval, and real-time debugging. Nevertheless, we believe that the idea of divide-and-conquer and consensus can be equally applied to such complex problems and represents a promising area for future research.\n\n> **Q3a: When computing the token usage, did you include tokens of unused samples when computing ""functionality similarity""?**\n\nYes, we included the token count for unused sampled functions, and we obtained token cost directly from OpenAI API\'s statistics. Hence the token count reported in our paper is the total token expenditure from all API calls throughout the process of solving a problem.\n\n> **Q3b: Can you also provide more statistics such as the medium token consumption in case the average number is biased by simple tasks?**\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We\'ve added a lot more statistics in our General Response and we\'ll include these data in our next revision.\n\n> **Q3c: The token consumption is much smaller than I expected according to the large prompts (and these will be called multiple times).**\n\nThank you for pointing out the concern about token costs. This is because the OpenAI Inference API still only charges prompt tokens once per call, when we use `n=k` sampling. We further discussed token costs in our general response, and concluded that it costs only $O(kN)$ tokens, same as *Standard* sampling.\n\n> **Q4: How\'s the token usage compared to other baselines?**\n\nWe list in Table 11 (Appendix A.6) the token usage for all other baselines. Note that some baselines are not open-sourced and the token usage details were not reported in the respective papers, so they are not included in the table.\n\n> **Q5: Is the technique single-turn or multi-turn when being implemented for evaluation?**\n\nWe used single-turn chat completions. In each call we only include a common prefix (system prompt and few-shot examples) and one assistant question describing the current task. This helps reduce token costs, context lengths and prevents context contamination.'}}, 'id': 'fdce9KXeV3', 'forum': 'cFqAANINgW', 'replyto': '7NaE86f9QD', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722958777833, 'cdate': 1722958777833, 'tmdate': 1730881309405, 'mdate': 1730881309405, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""We thank you for your time and effort in reviewing our paper! These are very helpful suggestions and we address your concerns as following:\n\n> **W1: The recursive decomposition of tasks into sub-functions inherently leads to the generation of numerous function headers, bodies, and documentations, which can significantly inflate the token count.**\n\nIndeed, decomposing the original problem into multiple functions may increase token usage. However:\n\n- Function headers and documentation don't occupy much tokens, since they typically just have a few lines, and are way smaller than the function body that might span to dozens of lines.\n- Programs that split functions don't have to be longer than un-split programs, due to function re-use which helps reduce redundant code.\n- Our method does not force the LLM to decompose overly simple tasks into subfunctions. In fact, the standard method also generates sub-functions, and both methods have similar resulting code lengths. Our approach just regenerates function with fine-grained divide-and-conquer above that.\n\nWe might also add that, we showed in Table 11 (L759) that although our token usage was not the best of all, but that it was small enough given its state-of-the-art performance (e.g. LDB took 23K tokens to get 82.9% while ours made 85.4% with 5.4K tokens).\n\n> **W2: Missing the median and the maximum tokens required to solve the HumanEval problem.**\n\nThank you for pointing out the flaws in our initial statistical method.

We discussed this proof in detail in general response, and this will be added to the next revision of this paper.\n\n> **Q1: Why baselines are different on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4?**\n\nSome results are directly obtained (and cited) from the original papers, and we've marked them with an underline in Table 1. Some methods only reported results for GPT-4, and upon careful examination, results for other models were not mentioned in these papers. In Appendix A.2, we provided details for which results were derived from the original papers, and specified whichever methods were specifically tailored for code generation or mathematical reasoning tasks.\n\nSome methods compared are not fully open-source or lack detailed instructions. Since we weren't able to reproduce them consistently, we had to cite them verbatim instead. We'd like to add more experiments in the next revision and get more updates on this topic.\n\n> **Q2: In Table-4, why do the authors choose CoT or self-refine as the main baseline while no more comparing with Parsel?**\n\nParsel did not provide prompts or code for tasks beyond code generation with HumanEval, and it is not designed specifically for mathematical reasoning. Therefore, we did not compare Parsel on the math tasks. Instead, we introduced baselines that were specifically designed for mathematical reasoning, which are more commonly used in that area, such as CoT, self-refine, and CR.\n\n- Standard and CoT serve as text-based baselines for mathematical reasoning, compared with other methods that solve math problems through code generation.\n- Self-Refine uses runtime feedback to fix code, serving as a baseline for comparison with our sampling-based approach.\n- CR (Cumulative Reasoning) is another baseline for step-by-step problem solving and was the previous SOTA method for the MATH dataset. Unlike our approach, which employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, CR uses a bottom-up technique that progressively derives the final answer.\n\nDetails about these methods are provided in Appendix A.2 (L627).\n\n> **Q3: Why do the authors choose not to disclose their code during the submission phase?**\n\nWe are still organizing our codebase during the paper submission phase. However, we are confident that we can prepare a minimal working code and accompanying bash scripts for replicating the experiments within the next few months. Meanwhile, as the principles of our method are relatively straightforward, to ensure reproducibility of our work, we have provided complete prompts verbatim so that just calling an API with these prompts would suffice. These prompts should work with most methods and models unless specifically noted.""}}, 'id': 'bhuwc9Vg6g', 'forum': 'cFqAANINgW', 'replyto': 'tQjNZBz8wx', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5273/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722958629202, 'cdate': 1722958629202, 'tmdate': 1730881309521, 'mdate': 1730881309521, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We sincerely thank you for your time and effort in reviewing our paper! We find your suggestions very helpful and we address your questions as follows:\n\n> **W1: The idea of decomposing the problem into subproblems and solving them recursively with an LLM is not entirely new.**\n\nAs is discussed in *4. Related work*, there is indeed previous work that decomposes problems into subproblems and explores them through search. But many of those focus on mathematical reasoning or multi-hop question answering, and can have difficulties applying to code generation.\n\nSpecific to code generation, we innovatively leveraged the inherent advantages of functions, using function signatures to identify sub-problems. We further relate sub-problems via function declaration and invocation, thus decomposing complex tasks in a more natural way. We believe that this form of task decomposition can have a more straightforward advantage in code generation and can better elicit the potential of code models.\n\n> **W2: Comparison between consensus and clustering.**\n\nWe find your suggestion to be very constructive. We have made a comparison between these methods on `gpt-3.5-turbo` and have observed a considerable advantage in functional consensus:\n\n| Method \\ Pass@1 | HumanEval | MBPP | xCodeEval | MATH |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Standard | 68.3 | 72.0 | 20.2 | 34.6 |\n| CodeT | 81.1 | 76.0 | 23.2 | n/a |\n| Clustering | 75.0 | 74.0 | 22.0 | 35.0 |\n| FunCoder (ours) | 85.4 | 78.5 | 31.4 | 54.0 |\n\n*Clustering* from AlphaCode strictly classifies programs into mutually independent groups by exactly identical outputs. Our method measures output similarity based on many input cases, which is a more permissive approach. Since inputs to a program may have edge cases, treating two programs distinctly just because one output was different, without considering how similar they are, is sub-optimal. For example:\n\n- Consider finding all square roots of a float. Generate 10 functions.\n- 4 results know that a positive number has two square roots. 4 results know that a negative number has imaginary square roots. Only 2 results considered both points.\n- Notice that the model gets 60% right for either point independently, but only 20% when the points are put together.\n- Clustering would put programs in three categories [4, 4, 2] based on output, and end up choosing who only gets one point right. But with our function similarity, the one who gets both points right that is on-more-aspects similar will be favored.\n\nGetting benefits on *Clustering* often requires more programs (even up to 1M in AlphaCode paper). Our method does well with just 11 sampled programs. Consensus is also exceptionally good at pass@1 while AlphaCode focused on pass@10 instead.\n\n> **Q1: On average, how many decomposition levels are used when solving the code generation tasks?**\n\nWe analyzed the depth of functions from the results and show them in this table:\n\n| | HumanEval | MBPP | xCodeEval | MATH |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (avg) Depth | 1.19 | 1.06 | 1.45 | 1.34 |\n\nNote that since we rely on the intrinsic capabilities of the model to determine whether or not to decompose functions during generation, we cannot forcibly control the depth of decomposition. The LLM tends to generate shallow code for simple problems and vice versa, which is why the average depth is just slightly above 1.0. But this method is quite effective on complex problems exhibiting deeper function depths.\n\n> **Q2a: Are the Standard and CodeT prompts used in the experiments the ones shown in Appendix C.1?**\n\nYes, both Standard and CodeT used the prompts from Appendix C.1. We will clarify this point in a later revision and explicitly specify the prompts used for each method on HumanEval.\n\n> **Q2b: Is this type of decomposition prompting also better for the Standard and CodeT methods?**\n\nTo ensure the fairness between the decompose prompt and the standard prompt, we used the same example in all prompts. So the *Standard* method also breaks down the original problem into multiple functions, but it generates all the functions all at once, whereas our *decomposition* prompting allows for recursive sub-function generation. However, it\'s worth noting that the *decomposition* prompt always requires iterative-decomposition, since it only produces sub-function stubs and would otherwise produce incomplete programs.\n\nIn Table 3, we conducted an ablation study on the results of decomposition. ""One-pass"" refers to just *Divide* (recursively decomposing) functions above *Standard*, and ""Two-pass"" refers to having both *Divide* and *Conquer* but without functional consistency applied. The results indicate that applying just recursive decomposition will still yield a considerable improvement.\n\n> **Q3: How does the consensus method compare to other self-consistency or AlphaCode-like majority clustering methods?**\n\nThanks for your suggestion. Clustering in AlphaCode can be viewed as self-consistency over programs in code generation. So we re-ran the experiments with majority clustering mentioned in AlphaCode, and you can see the results in our response to Weakness 2.\n\n> **Q4: In the abstract and line 167, it is said that GPT4 performance on HumanEval is about 97% but I can\'t find that number in Table 1. Is it mentioned elsewhere?**\n\nWe apologize for any confusion caused by our wording. What we intended to convey is that on the HumanEval dataset, StableCode-3b with FunCoder (81.0% pass@1) achieved 97.7% of the performance of GPT-4 with Standard (82.9% pass@1). This statement in the abstract aims to highlight that FunCoder can significantly enhance the code generation performance of small open-source models, bringing them close to that of advanced models, which to our belief was a very interesting finding.\n\nA similar point is also discussed in section 3.1.3 (L163-167).

There are two key components that make this method work well:\n\n1. A two-pass generation approach: When generating a function f, the first pass generates the function/plans without child functions being implemented yet. The second pass occurs when the children functions are implemented, conditioning on the children functions and regenerating the parent functions again. This is to overcome potential problems that may arise when parent functions are generated before child functions are concretely implemented.\n2.

There is a flaw in the design of functionality similarity. Authors claim in L104 that they sample inputs from the input domain of the function, namely D(f). First, it is non-trivial to infer D(f). While simple type analysis is applicable, oftentimes the pre-conditions of the function can go beyond type constraints. For example, the pre-condition asserts the input sequence is sorted when doing code generation for binary search. Second, it is challenging to accurately infer such pre-conditions, and inputs violating such pre-conditions often manifest undefined behaviors of function candidates, falsifying functionality-similarly candidates. For example, in the EvalPlus paper, these conditions are manually specified to ensure the soundness of test input generation. In summary, the equivalence-modulo-inputs idea requires knowing the accurate input domain and designing corresponding input samplers, which are oversimplified in this paper.\n2. Back to the high-level framework, it is unclear why functionality consensus would work in the first place. Functionality consensus selects the most common functor candidate, but commonality may not necessarily correlate with correctness in code generation. Correct samples can even be exceptional in sampling when the task is challenging to the LLM.\n3. The diversity of studied models is a bit limited. It would be helpful to run Divide-Conquer on more open models such as StarCoder2.\n\nMinor suggestions:\n1.

To this end, we propose FunCoder, a code generation framework incorporating the divide-and-conquer strategy with functional consensus. Specifically, FunCoder recursively branches off sub-functions as smaller goals during code generation, represented by a tree hierarchy. These sub-functions are then composited to attain more complex objectives. Additionally, we designate functions via a consensus formed by identifying similarities in program behavior, mitigating error propagation. FunCoder outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +9.8% on average in HumanEval, MBPP, xCodeEval and MATH with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

Please find our response below:\n\n> It is interesting to see that CAT3D can be generalized to various condition and target views. Is this capability attributable to that no positional encoding is used in CAT3D? To my knowledge, video models with positional encoding fail to be extended to inference with arbitrary lengths.\n\nWhile CAT3D does not use an embedding of time (e.g. positional encoding of the time index for each frame), it does use an embedding of camera pose (via the raymap). Unlike time embeddings where during training you only see a small but finite number of time embeddings, we see a much larger continuous set of pose embeddings which may aid in generalization. In video and language models, one still can get generalization depending on how you structure and interpolate the time embeddings (see e.g. [1, 2]).\n\n[1] Chen, Shouyuan, et al.

""The impact of positional encoding on length generalization in transformers.""\n\n\n> For the shift of the noise scheduler, I think the conclusion of using log(N) to shift the scheduler (N is the number of target images) is not convincing. Because when CAT3D is trained with 5 and 7 target views, it is just evaluated with N=5 in the scheduler. This only confirms that using large N helps multi-view training. The specific relationship between the number of views and the scheduler has not been thoroughly assessed in this paper, leaving the log(N) shifting here somewhat ambiguous. Furthermore, it\'s important to note that multi-view images should not simply be equated with high-resolution images, given that the overlap among multi-view images can vary greatly and is stochastic.\n\nIt is common practice in training video diffusion models to shift the noise schedule based on the number of target frames, to compensate for the amount of redundant information which may exist across pixels. This is similar to what is done when increasing a models spatial resolution. In reality, the amount of redundant information in a video is a function of the amount of camera and scene motion, i.e., how many pixels are similar or the same across frames, but the number of frames serves as a reasonable approximation. In practice, our model is adapted from a single image diffusion model, and therefore modifying the noise schedule from that base model is necessary, since supervising and predicting multiple frames strictly has more redundant information. And indeed, in practice, we found shifting noise (while training and sampling) improves the quality of results. It is true that we don’t dynamically adjust the schedule based on the number of target frames, we just use the same shift of log(5) for both 5 and 7 target frames, but we found that the difference between that shift in practice is small (e.g. the average LPIPS on the in-domain diffusion samples is 0.235 for shifting log(5) vs. 0.240 for shifting log(7)). The precise formula for log(N), while not explicitly defined in prior work, was something we derived approximately from the numerical noise schedule information provided in the video model literature [3,4]. We will add this detail to the paper. Future work on multi-view models may want to instead condition the model on logSNR and use different shifts when training and sampling with different numbers of frames.\n\n[3] Blattmann, Andreas, et al.

Below we address your questions and weaknesses mentioned:\n\n> Most techniques have been proposed.\n\nWe agree with you that CAT3D leverages existing techniques for individual components of the system. The innovation of CAT3D lies in the effective integration and scalability of those components: a multi-view diffusion model, efficient sampling strategies, and a robust 3D reconstruction pipeline, resulting in a powerful and practical system for 3D content creation given any number of input views. CAT3D decouples the generative prior from the 3D extraction process, which not only contributes to its efficiency and simplicity, but also allows for potential improvements in either component without affecting the other in future research.\n\n> Results from the 3D reconstruction / multi-view diffusion. \n\nAll results in the main text are renderings of optimized mip-NeRF models, but the Appendix also includes quantitative results of images produced by the multi-view diffusion model (Table 3), and the anonymous website in the supplementary contains qualitative samples from the multi-view diffusion model. We will clarify this in the revised draft, and are happy to include more results from the diffusion model in the main text if the reviewer deems this to be useful.\n\n> Run time on one GPU.\n\nThank you very much for pointing out the differences in timings. We have added a note to the Table indicating that our timings take place on 16xA100 GPUs, and are working to evaluate the timing for a single GPU. One advantage of our approach is that it can benefit from parallelism when generating novel views, while other methods built around distillation and feedforward prediction do not.\n\n> Support arbitrary conditions and targets.\n\nInterestingly, we find our model can work on test settings different from what the model is trained for to some extent. For example, we find that doubling the target views or tripling the conditional views still works (see Figures 2 and 3 in the rebuttal PDF). We still anticipate training or fine-tuning the model on the actual test settings would lead to better results. \n\n> Full-model generalization. \n\nThis is a good question and a valid concern. We tried to verify the generalization ability of our model empirically by, e.g., testing our model on a wide variety of captured or generated images that are far out-of-distribution from what the model is trained on (see gallery.html in the supplementary). In Table 3, we observe that the model initialized from the pretrained text-to-image model performs better than the model initialized from scratch quantitatively (suggesting that the pre-trained priors are still present or useful in some capacity). To further maintain the generalization ability, a possible future direction is to jointly train the model on our datasets mixed with the text-to-image data that the model is pretrained on. \n\n> Images with different aspect ratios\n\nWhile the multi-view latent diffusion model we trained only supports 512x512 images, we found the model still performed well when padding non-square images to square. However, this method often reduces resolution, so we also run our model on a square-cropped version of the inputs, and then compose the square-cropped outputs with the edges from the padded outputs to create a different aspect ratio image. We will add these details to the Appendix.\n\n\n> shift of the noise scheduler. \n\nAs we describe in the text (lines 143-145), we add $\\log(N)$ to the log signal-to-noise ratio, where $N$ is the number of target images. More concretely, assuming for the base text-to-image model each time step $t$ is mapped to a log signal-to-noise ratio $\\log \\lambda_t$; then for our model, $t$ is mapped to $\\log \\lambda_t - \\log(N)$. In settings with a mixed number of target views (e.g. 5 and 7 target views), we pick $N$ to be the smallest number of target views (i.e., 5). The logic is similar to [67] where the noise schedule is shifted for higher resolution generation (see Eqn (4) in [67]).\n\n> Drop the text embedding.\n\nIt is removed completely for model simplicity. While architecture changes like this can impact the stability of fine-tuning, we found that a learning rate warmup is sufficient to mitigate potential instabilities. \n\n> Mask and SD inpainting.\n\nThe mask we used is to specify conditioning vs. target images. It is constant per image (i.e., not spatially varying), whereas the mask in SD inpainting is used for indicating unknown pixels within an image, which may not align with our task. \n\n> 3DGS. \n\nAs far as we know, all radiance field models including 3DGS and NeRFs are data hungry and 3DGS doesn’t necessarily require fewer captured (or generated) images.

Below we address your questions and weaknesses mentioned:\n\n> performance with increasing sparsity and decreasing pose accuracy\n\nIn terms of performance while varying the number of input views with accurate camera poses, Table 1 includes qualitative results for 3, 6, and 9 view sparse reconstruction. The CAT3D model was not trained with missing or noisy poses, but some of our training data (CO3D) has imperfect pose which leads to some small amounts of robustness. To verify this, we conducted an experiment by perturbing the camera rotations of the input conditioning 3 views by a certain number of degrees, and measuring the error between the generated and ground truth target images. See Figure 1 in the rebuttal PDF for average PSNR across varying amounts of rotation perturbation on the MipNerf-360 dataset. Our model can handle small rotation perturbation. Fine-tuning the model with more perturbations on camera pose should lead to improved performance in this setting, which would be an interesting direction for future work.\n\n> manually designed camera trajectories\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that jointly learning a trajectory model or inferring trajectories given scene content is an exciting direction for future work. Empirically, we found a handful of simple heuristic trajectories worked well for our experiments, but ideally the trajectories should cover the scene without being placed inside of objects or walls as mentioned in line 167-169.\n\n> overstates its accomplishments\n\nWe are happy to revise language to better reflect limitations.

This is an artifact of our current training dataset where the camera intrinsics are approximately fixed for each scene. If we were to capture and include additional training data with camera intrinsics varying within a scene, we expect our model would be able to perform camera intrinsic manipulation. As far as limitations in expressiveness of the base model, one notable example is that our model performs poorly on human faces, as the base model was not trained on much human data. A showcase of the limitation of producing a small number of output views can be seen in the Supplementary website, where the generated spin video is clearly not perfectly 3D consistent. The need for manual camera trajectories is shown in Fig. 8, by the fact that it was necessary to create different types of trajectories based on characteristics of different datasets.

Below we address your questions and weaknesses mentioned:\n\n\n> cumbersome to generate a large number of viewpoints\n\nWe agree that jointly generating all target frames from the multi-view diffusion model would enable more consistent samples. However, simultaneously generating a large number of frames with video diffusion-like architectures is still an active area of research, with many SOTA text-to-video models using autoregressive generation in time to produce a larger number of frames (while losing consistency due to limited context length). By splitting the generation into anchors and then independent blocks of generation at different camera locations, we can efficiently generate a large number of frames *in parallel*. Building efficient architectures that can support the joint generation of a larger number of frames is an exciting direction for future research. \n\n> trajectory influences quality\n\nOur multi-view model can generalize to arbitrary camera trajectories, and we show results for other input capture types, e.g., forward-facing scenes like LLFF which contain several images pointed towards the same scene target. It is true that the model performance varies for different camera trajectories, and this is likely due to some of the biases inherited from our relatively limited training dataset. Mixing in training data with more diverse camera distributions could be an interesting future direction.\n\n> only use anchor views for reconstruction\n\nOur model was only trained to produce at most 8 views total (conditioning + target), and the 3D reconstruction methods we use (i.e., Zip-NeRF) are seldom able to reconstruct plausible geometry from 8 views (as a reference, see results with Zip-NeRF and 9 *real* views which are strictly better than 8 generated views in Table 1). Including additional frames through AR generation is critical to yield the high-quality reconstruction and NVS results we present in the paper (see also Fig. 6 that compares 80 vs. 720 frames).\n\n> densify views through video interpolation\n\n\nUsing a video interpolation model to generate frames is an interesting idea. However, it is not clear how to use such a model to incorporate more than 2 frames, and how to leverage the resulting frames in 3D reconstruction without explicit camera control. It’s also not clear whether this approach would be more efficient or would yield better quality results: if using an architecture similar to ours, the compute cost would be similar, and one would also have to estimate camera poses for the resulting frames (which adds an additional computational expense that our pose-conditioned multi-view diffusion models do not incur).'}}, 'id': 'eQk3D92yGr', 'forum': 'TFZlFRl9Ks', 'replyto': 'EAvMW3Lar7', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11975/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11975/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11975/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722998754541, 'cdate': 1722998754541, 'tmdate': 1730882701203, 'mdate': 1730882701203, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank all the reviewers for their time and critical feedback to improve our work.

Choosing the correct trajectory can be challenging for complex scenes, and we believe this is an exciting direction for future work. We found that simple orbit trajectories and forward-facing explorative trajectories can be useful across a wide variety of inputs (see Supplementary website), but for more complicated scenes a more automated strategy for bespoke trajectory selection would be useful. \n\nRegarding our autoregressive sampling strategy, we found that first producing anchors and then generating sets of views in parallel produced mostly consistent views while drastically accelerating sampling time.

Representation learning is important in discriminative tasks, which is defined as ""learning representations (or features) of the data that make it easier to extract useful information when building classifiers or other predictors"" . In this paper, we propose a novel Denoising Model for Representation Learning ( DenoiseRep ) to improve feature discrimination with joint feature extraction and denoising. DenoiseRep views each embedding layer in a backbone as a denoising layer, processing the cascaded embedding layers as if we are recursively denoise features step-by-step. This unifies the frameworks of feature extraction and denoising, where the former progressively embeds features from low-level to high-level, and the latter recursively denoises features step-by-step. After that, DenoiseRep fuses the parameters of feature extraction and denoising layers, and theoretically demonstrates its equivalence before and after the fusion, thus making feature denoising computation-free. DenoiseRep is a label-free algorithm that incrementally improves features but also complementary to the label if available. Experimental results on various discriminative vision tasks, including re-identification (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, MSMT17, CUHK-03, vehicleID), image classification (ImageNet, UB200, Oxford-Pet, Flowers), object detection (COCO), image segmentation (ADE20K) show stability and impressive improvements. We also validate its effectiveness on the CNN (ResNet) and Transformer (ViT, Swin, Vmamda) architectures.","Oral Session 4C: Diffusion-based Models, Mathematics",https://openreview.net/pdf?id=OycU0bAus6,https://openreview.net/forum?id=OycU0bAus6,OycU0bAus6,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'The paper received all accept recommendations.

I am still concerned about the following issues.\n\nFor Q1, I think the motivation of this paper is the same as that of [1, 2, 3], both of which apply denoising features to downstream tasks. I think it makes more reasonable to directly use the features of the pre-trained diffusion model.\n\nFor Q2, the results in Table 3 cannot provide strong evidence for the hypothesis stated by the authors in Line144-146 of the paper. Since the ReID loss is used to optimize the parameters of FEFDFA and the parameters of the FEFDFA are fused with the backbone in the final, I suspect that the performance improvement in the Table 3 is more like the data augmentation effect brought about by adding noise, rather than denoising. \n\nFor Q4, unless the authors provide relevant theory or previous works to prove that denoising loss can be used with other task losses to optimize diffusion models or visual task models, I believe that the training loss Eq.(12) is questionable. Denoising in diffusion is fundamentally different from other downstream visual tasks as the optimization objective of them are inconsistent.\nThe relevant paper listed by the author cannot provide evidence to the rebuttal.\nDiffDet[4] applies the idea of denoising to the bbox regression in object detection.\nDiffSeg[5] directly uses the intermediate attention layer features of the stable diffusion for the segmentation task, which is similar to the method [1,2,3] mentioned in Q1 that directly uses the intermediate layer features of the pre-trained diffusion model.\n\n[1] Mukhopadhyay, Soumik, et al.

Experimental results of Table 3 (FEFDUF) could empirically demonstrated the hypothesis of ""the features obtained by backbone extraction are noisy"". FEFDUF includes a well-trained person ReID model, and a denoise model which take feature of the ReID model as input and predict its noise. During the training stage, the ReID model is always frozen, and denoise model is trained under normal process in DDPM (i.e. adding a gaussian noise to feature, taking the nosied feature as input and predicting the original gaussian noise). During the inference stage, given images, we first extract features A with the well-trained ReID model, then put the features into the denoise module to predict its noise A\'. Finally, we found that A-A\' performs stably better than A. We will add the analysis above to the revised manuscript.\n&emsp;\n\nQ2: **The authors should evaluate the proposed method on these datasets instead of conventional ones.**\n\nA2: Thank you for the valuable suggestion. We validate our proposed FEFDFA on Occluded-Duke [1], Occluded-ReID [2] and Partial-ReID [3]. These datasets include person images occluded by misc obstacles such as vehicles, trees and so on, making them more challenging. We will add the experimental results to the revised manuscript. The experimental results are as follows, using mAP as the evaluation metric:\n |   Dataset    |  P-ReID |  OCC_Duke | OCC-ReID | \n |:-------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|\n | TransReID |  72.3%    | 59.5%    | 71.2%    | \n | TransReID+FEFDFA   |  73.5% (↑1.2%) |   60.4%  | 72.0% |\n\nQ3: **The authors lack an analysis of the model\'s complexity, including the number of parameters and training time.**\n\nA3: Thanks for your valuable feedback. Our proposed method takes LITTLE extra parameters and training time. The reason is the denoising layers employ simple linear layers, they are very light compared with heavy vision backbone (e.g. ViT, ResNet). For example, the parameter of ViT-Small is 22,313,320, while the sum of the parameters of the denoising module is only 3,538,944, an additional increase of about 15.8%. The detailed experimental results are as follows. Please note that these are training-time parameters, our proposed method takes no extra latency during the test stage.\n |   Backbone    |  Baseline |  Ours | Increase | \n |:-------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|\n | ViT-Small |  22,313,320    | 25,852,264    | 15.8%    | \n | ViT-Base   |  89,781,544 |   103,937,320 | 11.6% |\n\n\nQ4: **The performance gain are minimal.**\n\nA4: Thanks for your valuable feedback.

The latest experimental results on CLIP-REID show better improvement on MSMT (CLIP-REID: 75.8% v.s. CLIP-REID+OURS: 76.5% for mAP, see the table below). The code will be released after the manuscript is accepted. We will add the experimental results to the revised manuscript.\n&emsp;\n\nQ5: **The authors should verify the effectiveness of the proposed method using the visual encoder in CLIP as the backbone.**\n\nA5: Thanks for your insightful suggestion. CLIP is a very strong vision-text encoder, which is trained with 400 million data. Beyond CLIP, CLIP-ReID pioneeringly adapts CLIP, a zero-shot classifier, to ReID, a fine-grained image retrieval task. Our proposed FEFDFA is model-free, thus it can be easily applied to CLIP-ReID without any modification. The experimental results on CLIP-REID show stable improvement on MSMT (CLIP-REID: 75.8% v.s. CLIP-REID+OURS: 76.5% for mAP). The code will be released if the manuscript could be accepted. We will add the experimental results to the revised manuscript.

We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the differences between our ""Feature Extraction and Feature Denoising Fusion Algorithm"" (FEFDFA) and reparameterization.\n   - Reparameterization: Reparameterization typically involves restructuring the parameters of a model to facilitate more efficient training. It is widely used in variational autoencoders (VAEs) to allow for gradient-based optimization of stochastic variables.\n   - Feature Extraction and Feature Denoising Fusion Algorithm (FEFDFA): Our FEFDFA is designed to integrate feature extraction and denoising within the same backbone. Each embedding layer in the backbone serves a dual purpose: extracting features and performing denoising simultaneously. By deriving the formula for diffusion model sampling, the denoising layer parameters are fused with the feature layer parameters, so that the model has no additional time cost in the inference stage.\n&emsp;\n\nQ2: **It will be better if peformance on CNN series are shown.**\n\nA2: Thanks for your valuable feedback. Our proposed method is scalable to various baseline (including CNN, see Table 5 and line seven of Table 6 for details)  and downstream tasks, including CNN series (e.g. ResNet50), Transformer series (e.g. ViT, Vmanba), Person Re-ID (MSMT, Duke), Vehicle Re-ID (vehicReID), Image Classification (ImageNet, CUB). The experimental results in Section 4.4 of the main text and Appendix C demonstrate that our method significantly improves these tasks.\n&emsp;\n\nQ3: **Representation learning applications on more downstream tasks.**\n\nA3: Thanks for your valuable suggestion. Representation learning is a broad and foundational concept with potential applications across various downstream tasks. Due to the limited time, we extend our proposed FEFDFA to the object detection task with Mask-RCNN[2] as a baseline and COCO[1] as a benchmark. Experimental results show that ours carries stable improvements of 1.6%-1.1%. Please see the table below for details. We will extend ours to more downstream tasks including segmentation and generation, in future.\n\n | **MaskRCNN** | **bbox_mAP** | **bbox_mAP_50** | **bbox_mAP_75** | **mask AP** |\n |--------------|:--------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|\n | Swin-T       | 0.427        | 0.652           | 0.468           | 0.393       |\n | Swin-T+FEFDFA | 0.443(↑1.6%)       | 0.671           | 0.486           | 0.405       |\n | Swin-S       | 0.482        | 0.698           | 0.528           | 0.432       |\n | Swin-S+FEFDFA | 0.493(↑1.1%)       | 0.709           | 0.540           | 0.439       |\n\nQ4: **The hyper-parameter analysis is missed.**\n\nA4: Thanks for your reminder.

Our proposed DenoiseReID is different from the related works [1-3]. The related works [1-3] apply the itermediate layer features of an existing pre-trained diffusion model to improve downstream task. Ours applies the denoise algorithm to any existing pre-trained downstream model (e.g. Person ReID of Table 2, Vehicle ReID of table 5, Image Classification of Table 6). Compared with the related works [1-3], ours is more scalable (suitable to more downstream tasks) and light-weight (computation-free). We will carefully review and add them to the revised manuscript.\n  &emsp;\n\nQ2: **Line144-146, no evidence provided to support the proposed hypothesis.**\n\nA2: Thanks for the kind comment. Experimental results of Table 3 (FEFDUF) could empirically demonstrate the hypothesis of ""the features obtained by backbone extraction are noisy"". FEFDUF includes a well-trained person ReID model, and a denoise model which takes the feature of the ReID model as input and predicts its noise. During the training stage, the ReID model is always frozen, and the denoise model is trained like DDPM (i.e. adding a gaussian noise to feature, taking the nosied feature as input and predicting the original gaussian noise). During the inference stage, given images, we first extract feature A with the well-trained ReID model, then put the feature into the denoise module to predict its noise A\'. Finally, we found that A-A\' performs better than A. The training process DO NOT use any label because DDPM is an unsupervised manner. This experiment shows that simple denoising features contribute to improvement, partially supporting the view that ""the features obtained by backbone extraction are noisy"". We will add the analysis above to the revised manuscript.\n&emsp;\n\nQ3: **The training loss in Eq. (11) should be the sum of the MSE losses of each denoising layer.**\n\nA3: Thanks for the valuable reminder. This is a writing error. In the code implementation, the loss during the training of the denoising module is the sum of the MSE losses of each denoising layer. The code will be released if the manuscript could be accepted. We will polish the Eq. (12) to be:\n$$\nLoss_p = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left\\| \\epsilon_i - D_{\\theta_i} (X_{t_i}, t_i) \\right\\|\n$$\n\nQ4: **The statement is inconsistent.**\n\nA4: Thanks for your comments. There are THREE questions. Let\'s discuss them ONE BY ONE: \n  - (1) ""we freeze the original parameters and only train the FEFDFA."" This is our basic training setting. It only trains the parameters of FEFDFA with denoising and (optional) ReID loss. In all unsupervised settings, we use this training set (without ReID loss). It makes significant improvements. Specifically, in the experimental results between the second and first lines of Table 1, it can be observed that the performance of the unsupervised FEFDFA method has significantly improved compared to the baseline.\n  &emsp;\n  - (2) ""the parameters of the FEFDFA and baseline were trained alternately.""  Alternately training is a TRAINING TRICK for the supervised setting. Specifically, we (a) freeze the original parameters, train FEFDFA with denoising and reid losses, then (b) merge parameters of FEFDFA into the original parameters, train latest original parameters with ReID loss only, (c) repeat (a) and (b). In all supervised settings, we use this trick. It carries more improvement. Specifically, the experimental results in the second and third lines of Table 1. Note that step (a) still carries improvements in the supervised setting.\n  &emsp;\n  - (3) ""In addition, unless the baseline and FEFDFA are trained together, Eq. (12) is incorrect."" Eq.(12) is CORRECT even if parameters of FEFDFA are trained and the original parameters are frozen. Both ReID loss and denoising losses can be used to optimize parameters of FEFDFA. This equals to (2)-(a) above. Similar ideas of ""using task-related loss to supervise denoising module"" can be found in DiffDet[4] and DiffSeg[5]. \n\n  \n[1] Mukhopadhyay, Soumik, et al.

This unifies the frameworks of feature extraction and denoising, where the former progressively embeds features from low-level to high-level, and the latter recursively denoises features step-by-step. After that, *DenoiseRep* fuses the parameters of feature extraction and denoising layers, and *theoretically demonstrates* its equivalence before and after the fusion, thus making feature denoising computation-free. *DenoiseRep* is a label-free algorithm that incrementally improves features but also complementary to the label if available.

Rigid interactions are notoriously hard to model: small changes to the initial state or the simulation parameters can lead to large changes in the final state. Recently, learned simulators based on graph networks (GNNs) were developed as an alternative to hand-designed simulators like MuJoCo and Bullet. They are able to accurately capture dynamics of real objects directly from real-world observations. However, current state-of-the-art learned simulators operate on meshes and scale poorly to scenes with many objects or detailed shapes. Here we present SDF-Sim, the first learned rigid-body simulator designed for scale. We use learned signed-distance functions (SDFs) to represent the object shapes and to speed up distance computation. We design the simulator to leverage SDFs and avoid the fundamental bottleneck of the previous simulators associated with collision detection.For the first time in literature, we demonstrate that we can scale the GNN-based simulators to scenes with hundreds of objects and up to 1.1 million nodes, where mesh-based approaches run out of memory. Finally, we show that SDF-Sim can be applied to real world scenes by extracting SDFs from multi-view images.",Oral Session 5A: Graph Neural Networks,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=QDYts5dYgq,https://openreview.net/forum?id=QDYts5dYgq,QDYts5dYgq,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'This paper describes an approach to significantly improving the scale of simulations that can be successfully addressed by GNN based methods by employing learned Signed Distance Functions which effectively capture the geometry of the objects and lead to accelerated computational performance.

SDF-Sim cannot resolve deformable solids and fluids**\n\nWe fully agree that MeshGraphNet and DPI can handle broader types of physical systems. We are happy to add a more balanced statement to reflect that.\n\nWe would like to clarify that when we draw comparisons mesh-based GNN simulators, we generally refer to FIGNet and FIGNet* as these two models have shown the most complex rigid dynamics so far among the learned models. MeshGraphNet and DPI have shown amazing results in the realm of deformable simulation, however rigid bodies have their own unique challenges. Rigid collisions and contacts are non-smooth and are notoriously hard to derive numerical approximations for. Rigid dynamics is chaotic in nature: tiny errors in the model or in the initial states can quickly accumulate and lead to large deviations in later steps of the object trajectory. Hence, in this work we focus on rigid bodies only.\n\n**A clarification about the construction of the collision edges.**\n\nThe reviewer’s understanding is entirely correct: collision edges are created dynamically at every step of the simulation.\n\n\n**Constructing SDFs: Did the paper construct a narrow-band SDF or the full SDF on the whole grid as the training data for the network to fit?**\n\nWe don’t use SDF grids for training, as the reviewer might be suggesting. Instead, we randomly sample the ‘query’ points around the object by taking the points on the object surface and adding gaussian noise with zero-mean and sigma=0.1. We compute the SDFs for these query points and use them for training learned SDFs. Therefore, learned SDFs are not constrained to be narrow-band, although most of the training points fall within $2 \\sigma = 0.2$ distance from the object surface. Figure S1(d-e) shows that learned SDFs are most accurate within [-0.2, 0.2] distance interval from the surface. In practice, we only care about the accurate SDF estimates within the collision radius=0.1, therefore the current SDF accuracy is sufficient.\n\nWe provide more details on SDF training in Appendix D.1. \n\n**Did the network encourage unit SDF gradient norm during training?**\n\nWe did not find that it is necessary to specifically encourage the unit SDF gradient norm. We see this property naturally emerging during the training.  We think it is due to our training strategy where we randomly sample the query points near the object surface instead of training on grid points.\n\n\n**Computing closest points: Equation 1 is correct in theory. In practice, … one needs to apply Eqn 1 multiple times before obtaining a fairly accurate closest point.**\n\nEmpirically, we find that it is sufficient to apply Eq. 1 *once* to find the closest point on the object surface, thanks to the accurate learned SDFs. We use only one projection step in all our experiments. We invite the reviewer to inspect the Figure S1(a), where we compare the true closest point to the *one-step* projection* from a learned SDF and show that the mean-squared error stays within [1e-4, 1e-3] for different network sizes.\n\n\n**O(K^2) complexity of SDF-based inter-object edges: … simulators rarely go over all O(K^2) pairs in a brute-force manner.**\n\nHere we refer to the number of the constructed edges between the objects. Within the collision region, FIGNet an FIGNet* connect all mesh triangles of one object to all mesh triangles on another object, so the number of edges between the objects is O(K^2). In SDF-Sim we connect nodes of one object to the *center* of another object (within the collision region), so the number of edges grows only linearly in the number of nodes O(K). \n\nFor mesh-based simulators, K^2 edges would be a worst-case scenario in case the collision region is huge and spans the entire scene, which is indeed unlikely to happen.\n\nHowever, we can see that these asymptotic trends clearly manifest in Figure 7. The quadratic number of edges in FIGNet pose a significant problem, leading to 1M collision edges for 160 objects and causing the model to run OOM. SDF-Sim has <100k edges for the same simulation.\n\n\n**Spheres-in-Bowl and Shoes use repeated objects. These scenes … did not represent the “true” large-scale rigid-body simulation with …many rigid bodies with various shapes.**\n\nWe have an example of a large-scale scene with many objects with various shapes. It is shown in Figure 10 and replicated in the attached PDF for reviewer’s reference. The corresponding simulation video is shown on the project webpage (“Heaps of stuff” section). This simulation includes concave shapes (shoes, hanger) and thin structures (screwdriver, baking form). We will highlight it more in the final manuscript. \n\nSpheres-in-Bowl: Although sphere SDFs are trivial, Spheres-in-Bowl is a nice example to study the scaling properties of the models due to a large number of collisions within any given time step. We show other large-scale examples with more complex shapes, such as a pile of shoes (Figure 2), a pile of knots (Figure 10 top) and a mix of different objects (Figure 10 bottom). Finally, the bowl itself does not have an analytical SDF expression and still requires an SDF for collision detection.\n\n\n**Lines 69-71 suggest acceleration structures like BVH often rely on CPU implementations that are difficult to accelerate.

We will add the discussions below into the paper. We will also correct the reference to FIGNet* and DANO description in the related work. \n\n**Are euler integration and shape matching differentiable?**\n\nBoth Euler integration and shape-matching (using differentiable SVD) are differentiable, and we could potentially include those steps into the learning process. However, we suspect that the current loss on the nodes before shape-matching provides a fine-grained learning signal and forces the model to correct errors for each node individually.\n\n**Edge pruning in FIGNet$\\*$ is fairly adjusted? Influence on Fig 7? Can FIGNet$\\*$ outperform SDF-Sim overall?**\n\nThe edge pruning has one main parameter, which is the collision radius. We use the same collision radius of 0.1 for FIGNet, FIGNet* and SDF-Sim, matching the collision radius used in FIGNet and FIGNet* papers.\n\nIf we change the collision radius, we expect the relation between the models in Figure 7 to stay the same, because FIGNet* constructs O(K^2) edges within the collision region, while SDF-Sim has only a linear number of edges O(K), where K is the number of nodes. Given such asymptotic complexity, we do not think FIGNet* can outperform SDF-Sim.\n\n**Is the simulator real-time capable?**\n\nWe perform the simulation for 200 time steps, 5 seconds of total simulation time. \n\nWe have added a runtime comparison to PyBullet in the attached PDF (Figure 2). SDF-Sim has a similar runtime to PyBullet up to ~30 objects per scene. Generally, learned simulators are not real-time, except on very small scenes. \n \nWe note that optimizing our code for speed was not our goal. MuJoCo or Bullet use low-dimensional collision meshes to achieve real-time, while all of our large simulation scenes use relatively detailed node sets. Additionally, a large part of SDF-Sim runtime is spent on constructing the edges of the input graph, which can be sped up by faster edge pruning, batching SDF queries or using specialized cuda kernels.\n\n\n**Comparison to the analytical simulators such as NVidia PhysX, MuJoCo, bullet**\n\nThis is an interesting question. \nNote that we use Bullet simulations as the ‘ground-truth’ in experiments with Movi B/C (Figure 6) and Spheres-in-Bowl (Figure 8). As shown in Figure 6, SDF-Sim remains consistent with the Bullet simulation, having low translation and rotation error after 50 rollout steps.\n\nIn the attached PDF, we also added *new* comparisons to Bullet in terms of runtime, penetrations and simulation stability (Figures 2 and 3).\n\nWe note that it was not our goal to outcompete the state-of-the-art analytical simulators in runtime. We develop learned simulators because they have their own unique advantages that analytical simulators don’t provide, specifically for Robotics. The main difference is that learned simulators can be trained directly on real-world observations. They can track the real object trajectory better than analytical simulators, solving a well-known sim-to-real gap [1]. Another common issue is precisely estimating the initial states, which analytical simulators rely on – learned simulators can compensate for these inaccuracies [1]. Finally, learned simulators are differentiable and can be used for optimization and design [2]. At the same time, we agree that learned simulators were not optimized for runtime and are slower than analytical simulators. Therefore, in this paper we chose to only compare to other *learned* simulators.\n\n[1] Graph network simulators can learn discontinuous, rigid contact dynamics. Allen et al.

NeurIPS 2022.\n\n\n**Sec. 4.4. comparison to PhysX, MuJoCo, bullet on SDFs from vision, where extracted SDF is transformed into a mesh**\n\nWe expect that PhysX, MuJoCo, Bullet to be able to successfully handle the scene, since 80k nodes is feasible for these simulators.\n\nWe are not claiming that SDF-Sim is the only simulator that could do that. Instead, this experiment shows that 1) SDF-Sim can generalize to new scenes, despite being trained on synthetic data 2) We can plug in output from VolSDF directly into SDF-Sim, bypassing the mesh conversion 3) FIGNet already runs OOM on this scene\n\nWe will remove the wording “large” for this section and clarify the goals of this experiment in the paper.\n\n\n**The requirement of watertight objects can be a disadvantage too, if the objects are thin**\n\nModeling thin surfaces, e.g. cloths, is non-trivial, and it is outside of scope for this paper. Here we focus on modeling rigid objects, for which volumetric shapes are often a good approximation.\n\nAlthough SDF-Sim is not designed to represent cloths, other graph-network simulators, e.g. MeshGraphNet [1] are able to do so. One can imagine combining the ideas from SDF-Sim and MeshGraphNet, where rigid objects are represented as an SDF for efficiency, while thin/deformable objects are represented as a meshes.\n\n[1] Learning mesh-based simulation with graph networks. Pfaff et al. ICLR, 2021\n\n\n**A simple MarchingCubes reconstruction might be sufficient to extract a mesh from VolSDF**\n\nExtracting meshes intended for simulation require special handling for two reasons:\n\n1. Naive extraction with Marching Cubes leads to noisy meshes. VolSDF is a learned model and its zero values might not be *exactly* on the surface. Therefore, the meshes produced by MarchingCubes can contain holes or floating faces and might require substantial clean-up before they can be used in the simulator, because analytical simulators rely on the meshes to be watertight to perform inside-outside tests. \n\n2.

However, we found that even a basic MLP with 8 layers and 32 units per layer is sufficient to achieve <10e-5 error on SDF estimates and perform accurate simulation (Figures 9(a-c)). We did not find the SDF network capacity to be a limitation.\n\n**Every object's SDF-model need to be pushed on the GPU--or swapped in-and-out**\n\nEvaluating each SDF sequentially and swap them in-and-out would be very inefficient and slow.\n\nSDF weights are small, and we keep all object SDF on the GPU throughout the simulation. Even with many different object shapes in a given scene, keeping SDFs in GPU memory is not an issue. To compute the distances, we also evaluate all SDFs in parallel, leveraging the GPU accelerators. As mentioned in Limitations, it is possible to further reduce the memory consumption, if needed, by using amortized models, weight sharing, or faster SDF queries.\n\n**This work seems to use mostly a smaller set of repeatable object**\n\nWe emphasize that SDF-Sim is not specific to using repeatable objects. We provide an example of a large-scale simulation with many different objects in Figure 10 in the original paper (also replicated in the Rebuttal PDF for reviewer’s reference). \n\n\n**Why is it important to build learned simulators in the context of rigid-object simulations? Are the simulators also memory-constrained?**\n\nThis is a great question. The limitation of traditional simulators like MuJoCo or Bullet is that the simulations inevitably diverge from observations of real objects – a so-called sim-to-real gap [1]. The traditional simulators rely on hard-coded approximations of physical interactions that might not match the properties of real objects. It was shown that even with careful parameter tuning, the analytical simulators cannot precisely model a real cube tossed on a table [2]. This is a major problem for robotics, which heavily relies on simulated environments, and a long line of research in robotics is dedicated to mitigate the sim-to-real gap.\n\nIn contrast, learned simulators do not suffer from sim-to-real gap, as they can be directly trained or fine-tuned on real-world data. In fact, learned simulators can be better at tracking real objects than traditional simulators like MuJoCo, Drake or Bullet, even in the low data regime [3]. \n\nAnother advantage of learned simulators is that they are differentiable by nature and can be used for solving inverse problems, such as design or control (as noted in reviewer’s question below).\n\nHowever, learned simulators used to be memory-constrained and work only on small scenes with up to 10 objects – this is exactly the problem we are targeting in the paper.\n\n**A learnable surrogate model …  can also be useful as a differentiable simulation, e.g., in order to optimize the scene or some objects.**\n\nThis is a great point. SDF-Sim is fully differentiable: GNN and learned SDFs are differentiable by  nature of neural networks. We can also pass gradients through the construction of input graph from GNN to the learned SDFs. One can use a differentiable version of SVD for the shape-matching step.\n\nGenerally, GNN-based models can be successfully used as differentiable simulators to optimize an object shape, such as an airplane wing, and can provide more stable gradients than traditional differentiable simulators [4]. We believe that SDF-Sim inherits these properties and can be used  for differentiable simulation in the areas of mechanical design, robotics and more.\n\n**The vision experiment, simulating in an environment extracted from a multi-view NeRF reconstruction, is a bit underwhelming.  I am unsure what is the main point of this result.**\n\nThis experiment is a proof-of-concept that demonstrates 1) SDF-Sim can generalize to real-world object shapes derived from 3D reconstruction, although it was trained on “clean” shapes 2) we can directly connect the VolSDF outputs to SDF-Sim, making a fully-differentiable vision-to-simulation pipeline.\n\nThe alternative approach to simulating this scene would be to convert VolSDF output into a mesh and run a mesh-based simulator. However, generating clean meshes can be tricky and the meshes may need to be cleaned-up before they can be used in the simulator. Additionally, most rigid solvers like Bullet or MuJoCo rely on convex meshes, requiring additional convex mesh decomposition which is often done manually. In contrast, SDF-Sim directly takes SDF as an input, and we can bypass the step of converting SDFs into meshes.  \n\n**Would the proposed method also work for open surface objects, using their UDFs (unsigned distance functions)? Can it detect penetration?**\n\nWe hypothesize that SDF-Sim will work with UDF representations, assuming that UDFs are used for all objects and SDF-Sim is trained on UDF representations. \n\nThe learned simulators generally are able to detect penetrations using unsigned distances. For instance, mesh-based FIGNet baseline uses only the unsigned distances between individual triangles and can successfully reason about penetrations by pooling the information from pairs of faces on the surfaces of the two objects. In the current SDF-SIm paper, we performed an experiment with unsigned distances computed from a mesh (Appendix E.6) and found that the accuracy is similar to our current model with SDF representations.\n\n\n[1] What Went Wrong?

We will update the wording in the paper.\n\n**What is the difference between smaller scenes and larger scenes?**\n\nThe key difference is that having an order of magnitude more objects in large scenes leads to many more collisions. We specifically design large scenes to have stacked objects, as this setup is considered to be a particularly hard problem in rigid simulation. It requires resolving many collisions within the same time step and propagating the collision response across a chain of multiple objects. In contrast, in small scenes, the collisions are sparse and involve only pairs of objects. \n\nWe suspect that FIGNet* and FIGNet may have some slight accuracy advantage in pairwise collisions due to the explicit computation over the mesh. SDF-Sim is better at propagating those collisions across many objects and therefore has better performance on more challenging scenes with stacked objects.\n\n**Appendix E.6: What do you mean by ""train an SDF-Sim architecture using the accurate distances directly computed from a mesh""? Why do an experiment with unsigned signed distance?**\n\nThank you for pointing out the confusion – we will update the section to make it clearer.\n\nThe distances predicted by learned SDFs may not be perfectly accurate, because they come from a learned model. In Appendix E.6 we aim to test whether this is an issue for the simulator. To do so, we compute the distances using a brute-force distance computation between query points and each triangle in the mesh. Then we train the simulator using these distances instead of learned SDFs. It is tricky to estimate the SDF sign using this approach (whether the point is inside/outside of the mesh), so we use the unsigned distances. We found that using learned SDFs versus pre-computed distances makes little difference in practice.\n\n**Surface nodes … are the mesh vertices used for collision simulation? In Appendix E.5 surface nodes are samples from the SDF. Why isn\'t it the default design? Is there a trade-off?**\n\nThis is correct – for most experiments in the paper we used mesh vertices from the original collision meshes as surface nodes for SDF-Sim. The only exception is the experiment in section E.5, where the nodes were sampled from an SDF. \n\nIndeed, we have shown that we can potentially scale the simulator further by re-sampling the nodes from an SDF. However, the tradeoff of node re-sampling is that it introduces an additional step of the pipeline with its own set of hyperparameters (grid size, downsampling, etc.) that might need to be tuned for more complex shapes.

For collisions between deformable bodies like those in MeshGraphNet and DPI, a precomputed SDF is not possible because shapes deform over time. Therefore, comparing this paper with MeshGraphNet and DPI is neither fair nor necessary: one wouldn’t use particle systems like DPI to simulate rigid bodies in the first place. I think the paper needs to provide a much more balanced statement about these methods.

Rigid interactions are notoriously hard to model: small changes to the initial state or the simulation parameters can lead to large changes in the final state. Recently, learned simulators based on graph networks (GNNs) were developed as an alternative to hand-designed simulators like MuJoCo and Bullet. They are able to accurately capture dynamics of real objects directly from real-world observations. However, current state-of-the-art learned simulators operate on meshes and scale poorly to scenes with many objects or detailed shapes. Here we present SDF-Sim, the first learned rigid-body simulator designed for scale. We use learned signed-distance functions (SDFs) to represent the object shapes and to speed up distance computation. We design the simulator to leverage SDFs and avoid the fundamental bottleneck of the previous simulators associated with collision detection.\nFor the first time in literature, we demonstrate that we can scale the GNN-based simulators to scenes with hundreds of objects and up to 1.1 million nodes, where mesh-based approaches run out of memory. Finally, we show that SDF-Sim can be applied to real world scenes by extracting SDFs from multi-view images.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'graph_neural_networks'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/a025a4908402e558708ed28771812dd10af193dd.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\nrubanova2024learning,\ntitle={Learning rigid-body simulators over implicit shapes for large-scale scenes and vision},\nauthor={Yulia Rubanova and Tatiana Lopez-Guevara and Kelsey R Allen and William F Whitney and Kim Stachenfeld and Tobias Pfaff},\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=QDYts5dYgq}\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'rubanova|learning_rigidbody_simulators_over_implicit_shapes_for_largescale_scenes_and_vision'}}, 'id': 'QDYts5dYgq', 'forum': 'QDYts5dYgq', 'license': 'CC BY-NC 4.0', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9449/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9449/Authors'], 'number': 9449, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9449/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9449/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1715679980370, 'cdate': 1715679980370, 'tmdate': 1730873920845, 'mdate': 1730873920845, 'pdate': 1727287911520, 'odate': 1730873920823, 'version': 2}]"

To facilitate geometry-aware guidance in physical property estimation, we introduce a novel hybrid framework that leverages 3D Gaussian representation to not only capture explicit shapes but also enable the simulated continuum to render object masks as 2D shape surrogates during training. We propose a new dynamic 3D Gaussian framework based on motion factorization to recover the object as 3D Gaussian point sets across different time states. Furthermore, we develop a coarse-to-fine filling strategy to generate the density fields of the object from the Gaussian reconstruction, allowing for the extraction of object continuums along with their surfaces and the integration of Gaussian attributes into these continuum. In addition to the extracted object surfaces, the Gaussian-informed continuum also enables the rendering of object masks during simulations, serving as 2D-shape guidance for physical property estimation. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and metrics. Additionally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through real-world demonstrations, showcasing its practical utility.

If the 4D geometry is accurate enough, is it adequate to only use 3D supervision? Ablation studies are needed to validate the necessity of 2D mask supervision.\n\n**Reply:** Thank you for this constructive advice. \n\n(1) To answer the first question, we perform system identification on the torus object, which is the only instance that provides a ground truth mesh model in the PAC-NeRF dataset. Specifically, we use the ground truth point clouds as the continuum for simulation and utilize the mesh model to extract surface particles from the point cloud as 3D supervision. The experiment, performed with this configuration and other settings unchanged, achieves $E = 1,002,907.25$ and $\\mu = 0.2991$, which are close to the ground truth ($E = 1,000,000$ and $\\mu = 0.3$). Therefore, we believe that **it should be sufficient to use 3D object surfaces as supervision once the recovered geometry is accurate enough**. \n\n(2) To evaluate the necessity of 2D mask supervision, we perform system identification on 45 cross-shaped object instances in the PAC-NeRF dataset by our method but with only object surface supervision. The results are reported in the table below. It is obvious to see that combining both 2D and 3D shapes as supervision can achieve more accurate performance compared to using 3D shapes only. Therefore, we believe that **utilizing 2D mask supervision to some extent makes up for the errors introduced by the 3D object surfaces extracted from dynamic 3D Gaussians**. We will add the analysis to the revised version. \n\n| **Type**          | **Parameters**   | **w/o masks**            | **w/ masks**             |\n|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Newtonian**     | $\\log_{10}(\\mu)$ | $2.19 \\pm 2.90$          | $\\mathbf{1.53 \\pm 1.31}$ |\n|                   | $\\log_{10}(\\kappa)$ | $24.2 \\pm 22.2$       | $\\mathbf{14.8 \\pm 19.2}$ |\n|                   | $v$              | $0.20 \\pm 0.08$          | $\\mathbf{0.20 \\pm 0.07}$ |\n| **Non-Newtonian** | $\\log_{10}(\\mu)$ | $19.4 \\pm 27.7$          | $\\mathbf{13.5 \\pm 18.2}$ |\n|                   | $\\log_{10}(\\kappa)$ | $24.0 \\pm 24.8$       | $\\mathbf{12.9 \\pm 16.8}$ |\n|                   | $\\log_{10}(\\tau_Y)$ | $\\mathbf{4.58 \\pm 9.11}$ | $4.80 \\pm 3.92$      |\n|                   | $\\log_{10}(\\eta)$ | $49.1 \\pm 40.5$         | $\\mathbf{40.7 \\pm 24.6}$ |\n|                   | $v$              | $1.33 \\pm 0.54$          | $\\mathbf{0.19 \\pm 0.09}$ |\n| **Elasticity**    | $\\log_{10}(E)$   | $2.85 \\pm 1.94$          | $\\mathbf{2.43 \\pm 3.29}$ |\n|                   | $\\nu$            | $3.97 \\pm 2.64$          | $\\mathbf{2.52 \\pm 2.03}$ |\n|                   | $v$              | $\\mathbf{0.22 \\pm 0.10}$ | $0.82 \\pm 0.32$          |\n| **Plasticine**    | $\\log_{10}(E)$   | $\\mathbf{25.6 \\pm 27.4}$ | $25.6 \\pm 29.4$          |\n|                   | $\\log_{10}(\\tau_Y)$ | $9.04 \\pm 2.37$       | $\\mathbf{1.67 \\pm 1.21}$ |\n|                   | $v$              | $1.16 \\pm 0.00$          | $\\mathbf{0.22 \\pm 0.10}$ |\n| **Sand**          | $\\theta_{fric}$  | $\\mathbf{2.55 \\pm 2.03}$ | $4.18 \\pm 0.52$          |\n|                   | $v$              | $0.31 \\pm 0.18$          | $\\mathbf{0.17 \\pm 0.05}$ |\n\n---\n\n> 3. Coarse-to-fine density field creation: At the beginning, the reconstruction contour is much larger than the object. How does it shrink to the actual boundary? The $TrilinearInterpolation$ operator will not shrink the contour, and there is no operator to assign zeros.\n\n**Reply:** Sorry for the lack of clarity. Although all the operations cannot assign voxels outside an object to zeros, the trilinear interpolation and mean filter operations can reduce the density of the voxels outside the object boundary. By iteratively performing mean filtering and particle voxel reassigning, the densities outside the boundary will be sufficiently small while the object boundary and internal region keep high-density values, and we thus can extract the object particles by thresholding the density field. \n\n---\n\n> 4. In the simulation, how do the Gaussian kernel scales evolve? The paper seems to assume isotropic kernels, but physical deformation can transform the sphere into an ellipse. How is this addressed?\n\n**Reply:** Sorry for the lack of clarity. In this work, we use the grid size of the density field as scale attributes of Gaussian kernels and fix them during the simulation. We admit that a physics-informed scale transformation such as PhysGaussian [1] allows a more realistic rendering. In future work, we will integrate this function into our method to enable kernel transformation during simulation. \n\n---\n\n[1] Xie, Tianyi, et al.

We conducted two ablation analyses to empirically demonstrate the arguments mentioned in lines 168-171.\n\n(1) We first use our method to perform dynamic Gaussian reconstructions on 45 cross-shaped objects in the PAC-NeRF dataset, except each motion basis is modeled with an independent network. Specifically, each basis takes the encoded time as input and contains 8 fully connected layers. The output is the residuals of position and scale of this basis. We use the setting mentioned in Sec. 5.1 to evaluate the CD and EMD on the above method variants and compare them with our method. The results are reported in the table below. The results show that our backbone-shared architecture (**Ours**) slightly outperforms the independent-basis networks (**Ind.**) in terms of dynamic reconstruction, which empirically demonstrates the strength that the reduced order modeling of dynamic Gaussians is sufficient for motion reconstruction tasks. Moreover, our method can achieve less training time compared with the independent design (around 15 minutes vs. 45 minutes for a dynamic scene on a single 3090 GPU).\n\n|                | CD $\\downarrow$ (Ind.)    | CD $\\downarrow$ (**Ours**) | EMD $\\downarrow$ (Ind.)    | EMD $\\downarrow$ (**Ours**) |\n|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Newtonian      | 0.250                     | **0.243**                  | 0.026                      | **0.025**                   |\n| Non-Newtonian  | 0.204                     | **0.195**                  | 0.023                      | **0.022**                   |\n| Elasticity     | 0.188                     | **0.178**                  | 0.022                      | **0.020**                   |\n| Plasticine     | 0.215                     | **0.196**                  | 0.024                      | **0.022**                   |\n| Sand           | 0.273                     | **0.250**                  | 0.028                      | **0.025**                   |\n| Mean           | 0.226                     | **0.212**                  | 0.025                      | **0.023**                   |\n\n(2) To validate the second argument in lines 171-172, we compared our method with DynMF [1], which also uses neural networks as learnable bases while considering motion coefficients as time-invariant Gaussian attributes, by evaluating the PSNR on the D-NeRF dataset. The results are reported in the table below.

It is important that the experimentation on complex motions must be performed in order to truly understand the strength of the proposed method.\n\n**Reply:** Thank you for this suggestion. We conduct an additional experiment on a scenario with a more complex boundary condition and motion trajectory. Specifically, we use our method to perform system identification on an elastic rope falling onto two rigid cylinders. The data format is the same as PAC-NeRF. The estimated property is reported in the table below, and the simulated trajectory is visualized in the attached PDF. The results show that our method can also generalize to scenarios with more complex boundary conditions and motions.\n\n|        | Initial Guess | PacNeRF         | Ours               | Ground Truth |\n|--------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| $E$    | $10^3$        | $1.12 \\times 10^5$ | $\\mathbf{1.03 \\times 10^5}$ | $10^5$       |\n| $\\nu$  | $0.4$         | $0.22$          | $\\mathbf{0.23}$    | $0.3$        |\n\n---\n\n[1] Kratimenos, Agelos, Jiahui Lei, and Kostas Daniilidis.

In the real-world experiment, I found the authors switched to FEM for deformable body simulation, which conflicts with the MPM simulator used in their pipeline. I think it needs justifications.\n\n**Reply:** Sorry for the confusion caused. Switching to FEM is because most of the widely-used robotic simulators incorporate FEM for deformable object simulation, including Isaac Gym, the simulator we used in our experiments. Moreover, estimating physical parameters using MPM and then applying them to FEM should be a feasible way for this application, since\n\n(1) both the Material Point Method (MPM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM) originate from Galerkin methods [3]. In theory, MLS-MPM can achieve first-order consistency in simulations [3], which is comparable to the consistency achieved by linear FEM simulations, \n\n(2) the material properties (e.g., Young\'s modulus and Poisson\'s ratio) are independent of the numerical methods.\n\nWe will clarify this in the revised version. \n\n---\n\n> 2. Some wordings are confusing: e.g., line 166, do you mean effective instead of efficient?\n\n**Reply:** Sorry for the confusion caused. Indeed, we should use ""effective"" in line 166. We will correct the expression in the revised version. \n\n---\n\n> 3. I wonder what makes the difference between the proposed method and PAC-NeRF in the infilled particle generation.\n\n**Reply:** Sorry for the lack of clarity.\n\n(1) PAC-NeRF samples particles by directly selecting NeRF field voxels whose alpha values are greater than the predefined threshold and then performing uniform sampling 4 times on each extracted voxel. Since PAC-NeRF defined the alpha threshold with **a small value** to make sure that a solid continuum can be obtained, they usually tend to recover over-large shapes. \n\n(2) On the contrary, our method turns to generate a density field based on the Gaussian and initial particles {$\\mu(t)$} $\\cup P_{in}$. Among these particles, the Gaussian particles are prone to be located at the object surface, which can guarantee high density at the surface region, while the initial ones incorporated with the coarse-to-fine operations can ensure a solid internal region. With this module, we can extract the continuum from the density field, which serves only for **representing the object shape** instead of the NeRF field, which is utilized for **rendering**. Please refer to Figure 7 in Appendix A.2.2 to see the qualitative results of the proposed filling algorithm, along with ones from PAC-NeRF.\n\nWe will add more explanation in the revised version.\n\n---\n\n> 4. If I understood correctly, the motion network only takes time as input. I wonder if it helps by combining the temporal encoding from DiffAqua [1] to further capture the low and high frequencies.\n\n**Reply:** Sorry for the lack of clarity. We do employ temporal and positional encoding to the time $t$ and position $\\mu_0$, respectively, to introduce features with various frequencies. Specifically, the encoding module is denoted as $\\gamma(x) = \\left( \\sin(2^k \\pi x), \\cos(2^k \\pi x) \\right)_{k=0}^{L-1}$, where $L=10$ for both $t$ and $\\mu_0$, which is exactly the same as the setting in DiffAqua. We will add the notations to Figure 2 and the implementation details to Appendix A.1.1 in the revised version. \n\n---\n\n> 5. The infilling algorithm seems expensive since the complexity grows exponentially. Did you try using Octree [2] or similar algorithm to speed it up?\n\n**Reply:** Although the memory requirements for processing the volumetric data scales cubically with the grid resolution, we still use the naive volumetric data structure for our algorithm because \n\n(1) in practice, only **four** iterations are required to achieve sufficient accuracy (the implementation details are also available in Appendix A.2.1), \n\n(2) such a data structure can be efficiently implemented with GPU acceleration based on PyTorch, where the trilinear interpolation and mean filter operations are implemented by ""grid_sample"" and ""conv3d"" functions, respectively. \n\nTherefore, we can almost achieve real-time performance (more than 10 fps on a single Nvidia 3090 GPU) on our infilling algorithm.\n\n---\n\n[3] Hu, Yuanming, et al.

Some of the technical terms are misused, making the paper confusing to read. For example, ""implicit shape representation"" is repeatedly used to refer to the rendered object image masks, but ""implicit"" generally refers to using functions (parametric or neural networks) to represent shapes, where shapes must be retrieved through function evaluations, hence ""implicit"". …\n\n**Reply:** Sorry for the confusion caused. Since our method employs both 3D surface particles and 2D object masks for supervision, we originally intended to use ""implicit shape representation"" to describe 2D object masks in order to distinguish them from 3D surface particles, but we overlooked the ambiguity it introduced. We will correct the description by directly using 2D object masks in the revised version.\n\n---\n\n> 1.

We will also add the table to the Appendix in the revised version. \n\n---\n\n> 2. System Identification: How do you set the initial parameters for the system identification? Are the optimizations sensitive to initial conditions?\n\n**Reply:** The table in the attached PDF also lists each instance\'s initial guess. To make a fair comparison, we followed the setting in PAC-NeRF [1] to assign the same initial values for the instances with the same material. The results show that our method is robust to initial conditions even when they are significantly different from the ground truth. \n\n---\n\n> 3. Figure 4: Would mask-based supervision fail when the estimated shapes are significantly different from the ground truth? Have you observed any cases where this occurs?\n\n**Reply:** Under extreme conditions, the mask-based supervision might fail when the simulated trajectory is completely out of view for all viewpoints. However, we did not find any failure cases in our experiments, because we performed initial velocity estimation before system identification. With the initial velocity available and multiple viewpoints located at proper positions, we observed that it\'s unlikely that the simulated trajectory is outside the field of view, and the estimated shapes will always converge to the ground truth shapes even if they have significant discrepancies at the initial stage. \n\n---\n\n> 4.

References: It would be beneficial to include references to works on differentiable cloth simulation for system identification and inverse problems, such as ""Differentiable Cloth Simulation for Inverse Problems"" by Liang et al. and ""DiffCloth: Differentiable Cloth Simulation with Dry Frictional Contact"" by Li et al.\n\n**Reply:** Thank you for this suggestion. These two works also tackle the inverse problems with differentiable simulators, particularly in cloth material. We will cite the related works you mentioned in our revised manuscript.\n\n---\n\n> 6. Limitations: I do wonder about the failure cases of the method if there are any.\n\n**Reply:** In the synthetic experiments, we didn\'t encounter any failure cases on both the PAC-NeRF [1] and SpringGaus [2] synthetic datasets, since each scenario includes video sequences from 10 or 11 distinct viewpoints, which are sufficient for dynamic Gaussian reconstruction. However, the proposed dynamic Gaussian module would fail to reconstruct the trajectory on the SpringGaus real dataset because it only contains 3 viewpoints to capture the dynamic scene. That\'s why we only use object masks for the supervision of system identification (More details are illustrated in Section 5.3 and Appendix A.5.). Therefore, our method might not perform well when **fewer views** of the scenario are available. Using fewer views to recover both geometry and system identification is more practical and will be an interesting direction for future work. \n\n---\n\n[1] Xuan Li, Yi-Ling Qiao, Peter Yichen Chen, Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula, Ming Lin, Chen-fanfu Jiang, and Chuang Gan.

Most advanced GCL methods fall into three main frameworks: node discrimination, group discrimination, and bootstrapping schemes, all of which achieve comparable performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and factors that contribute to their effectiveness are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we revisit these frameworks and reveal a common mechanism—representation scattering—that significantly enhances their performance. Our discovery highlights an essential feature of GCL and unifies these seemingly disparate methods under the concept of representation scattering. To leverage this insight, we introduce Scattering Graph Representation Learning (SGRL), a novel framework that incorporates a new representation scattering mechanism designed to enhance representation diversity through a center-away strategy. Additionally, consider the interconnected nature of graphs, we develop a topology-based constraint  mechanism that integrates graph structural properties with representation scattering to prevent excessive scattering. We extensively evaluate SGRL across various downstream tasks on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its efficacy and superiority over existing GCL methods. Our findings underscore the significance of representation scattering in GCL and provide a structured framework for harnessing this mechanism to advance graph representation learning.

To address your concerns, we respond below.\n\n> The proposed SGRL is an augmentation-free framework, avoiding manual bias and reducing training overhead in augmentation. To my knowledge, there are also some augmentation-free contrastive methods available, such as [1, 2]. While data augmentation is not the main focus of this paper, it may be beneficial if the authors provide a comparison between SGRL and this type of method.\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We will provide a comparison between SGRL and [1, 2] regarding data augmentation. \n\n- [1] generates positive samples of original nodes through k-NN search and filters these samples from both local (whether nodes are connected) and global perspectives (whether they belong to the same cluster), which overemphasizes structure information. \n- [2] generates different views by introducing random, uniform noise into the original representations, neglecting the impact of the structure information. \n- In contrast, SGRL considers both structure and attribute information. Specifically, SGRL employs an asymmetric dual-channel design, generating views from a structure perspective with topological semantics ($H_{online}^{topology}$) and an attribute perspective with scattered representations ($H_{target}$). Therefore, our augmentation-free method supports a more comprehensive utilization of the graph's information.\n\n> In SGRL, an existing component, EMA [3, 4], is given new functionality to balance the adversarial effects of two constraints (RSM and TCM) and achieve satisfactory results. I find this innovation interesting. However, it would be better if the authors provided further discussions and experiments on the chosen EMA’s hyper-parameters, since different hyper-parameters of EMA may make the two adversarial branches achieve different equilibrium.\n\nThank you for suggesting improving the experiment. To investigate the impact of EMA on the two branches, we evaluated the performance of SGRL by changing the hyper-parameter $\\tau$. We set the value of $\\tau$ to 0.99 (align with the value in our paper), 0.95, 0.90, 0.80, 0.50, 0.00 (SGRL-EMA), and the experimental results are shown in Table Re-HnqZ-1. \n\n**Table Re-HnqZ-1: The Impact of EMA.**\n|| 0.99 | 0.95 | 0.90 | 0.80 | 0.50 | 0.00 |\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| Co.CS | 94.15±0.04 | 94.08±0.02 | 94.11±0.02 | 94.09±0.05 | 94.04±0.01 |\t93.89±0.07 |\n| Co.Physics | 96.23±0.01 | 96.18±0.05 | 96.16±0.03 | 96.16±0.01 | 96.17±0.02 |96.16±0.07 |\n| Wiki-CS | 79.40±0.13 | 79.40±0.08 | 79.38±0.08 | 79.39±0.09 | 79.38±0.06 | 79.36±0.08 |\n\nIt is evident from the result that SGRL achieves the best performance when $\\tau = 0.99$. This is because the topological semantic information is gradually fed into the representation scattering mechanism at each epoch, which moderates the adversarial interaction between the two branches. In addition, when the topological semantic information excessively influences the representation scattering process (as $\\tau$ decreases), SGRL’s performance slightly declines but remains better than SGRL-EMA ($\\tau = 0.00$). This result indicates that balancing the two adversarial branches is necessary, which is consistent with our conclusions in Section 5.2. We will explore more effective balancing methods in future work.\n\n> The provided theory primarily discusses the impact of representation scattering mechanisms on various GCLs, encompassing multiple aspects such as data augmentation, GNN encoders, and negative contrasting. However, the authors seem to have omitted positive contrasts. While topological aggregation constraints can be seen as a more effective form of positive sample contrast, I still hope the authors can incorporate positive contrast into the proposed theory.\n\nSGRL is different from traditional contrastive learning based on positive and negative sampling. In SGRL, we do not focus on defining positive and negative samples. Instead, we propose two mechanisms that train the encoder in an adversarial-like manner. In addition, positive contrasting is usually used to train the encoder to learn consistent representations across different views, whereas TCM aims to regulate the scattering of representations in space. \n\n> p.2 line 72.\n\nIt indicates that TCM can enhance the robustness of SGRL. We explain this in Section 4.3.\n\n> p.3 line 149 and Table 1.\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We will make corrections in future version.\n\n> The analysis of DGI is based on the assumption that the perturbation is randomly shuffling the node features. While the authors have provided discussions in Theorem 1 when this assumption fails, I wonder whether the discussion on the shortcomings of DGI-like methods remains valid when this assumption fails.\n\nSorry for the confusion. We follow the setup described in Section 3.1: Node $v_i$ and its first-order neighbors follow the distribution $ p_i(\\cdot)$ over $\\mathbb{R}^{M+1}$. In DGI, they design the other corruption function $C$ by sampling, i.i.d., a switch parameter $\\Sigma_{ij}$ to determine whether to corrupt the adjacency matrix at position $(i,j)$. Given a corruption rate $\\rho$, they get perturbed graph by $\\hat{A} = A \\oplus \\Sigma$, where $\\oplus$ is the XOR (exclusive OR) operation and $\\Sigma_{ij} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\rho)$. In this case, node $v_i $ has a probability of $1/2k$ to connect with node $v_j$, where $v_i, v_j \\sim p_i(\\cdot)$. However, DGI indiscriminately maximizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the original graph and the perturbed graph, treating such cases as negative samples, which leads to additional bias. Although the probability changes (from $1/k$ to $1/2k$), this does not affect the analysis of the shortcomings of DGI-like methods.""}}, 'id': 'XoL5gNcHsa', 'forum': 'R8SolCx62K', 'replyto': 'yJephZ5t7M', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5733/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5733/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5733/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723012082272, 'cdate': 1723012082272, 'tmdate': 1730881418359, 'mdate': 1730881418359, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""Thank you for taking the time to read and review our submission.

I hope the authors provide a detailed explanation of this phenomenon.\n\nWe have provided explanations in the caption of Figure 1, but your comments made us realize that further clarification is needed.\n\n**Figure 1(a):** This figure shows the t-SNE embedding of randomly initialized GNN on Co.CS, where blue points represent the representation distribution of the perturbed graph and red points depict that of the original graph. It can be clearly observed that the representation distribution of the perturbed graph approximates the center of the original graph's representation distribution, which is consistent with the formulation provided in Theorem 1.\n\n**Figure 1(b):** This figure illustrates the t-SNE embedding after training on a one-layer GNN. Compared to Figure 1(a), there is a more pronounced separation between the specific semantic distributions of the original graph (red points) and the center, while the distribution of the perturbed graph (blue points) has converged more towards the center. Additionally, the intra-class boundaries within the original graph have become more distinct. The transition from Figure 1(a) to Figure 1(b) intuitively shows the outcome of DGI training, where the specific semantic distribution of the original graph diverges from the center. According to Corollary 3, this process is a specific case of representation scattering.\n\n**Figure 1(c):** This figure presents the result after training on a two-layer GNN. The incorporation of nonlinear activation functions makes Figure 1(c) align closely with the objective of DGI, which is to maximize the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between the distributions of the original and perturbed graphs. Based on Figures 1(b) and 1(c), we can conclude that the training objective of DGI maximizes the JS divergence between the specific semantic distribution of the original graph and its mean distribution.\n\n> Is the proposed central discrete loss effective in all scenarios? In extreme cases, if all node representations converge at a single point, can this loss achieve dispersion?\n\nThe extreme scenario you mentioned, where all node representations converge to a single point, is indeed meaningless as it would result in indistinguishable node representations. We have considered a scenario similar yet meaningful to the one you described.\nConsider an embedding subspace $\\mathbb{E}$ containing a set of points $\\mathcal{V}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. In this subspace $\\mathbb{E}$, for any $v_i, v_j \\in \\mathcal{V}$, their representations satisfy $||h_i - h_j||_2^2 < \\epsilon$. In this case, the center-away loss plays a significant role. It emphasizes distancing nodes from a relative mean center rather than a fixed absolute center. Initially, even if all nodes are clustered within the subspace $\\mathbb{E}$, by promoting their distance from the dynamic scattered center $\\mathbf{c}$, SGRL is still effective.""}}, 'id': 'k0Y7YSBJ8V', 'forum': 'R8SolCx62K', 'replyto': 'R69YSgYIka', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5733/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5733/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5733/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723004695866, 'cdate': 1723004695866, 'tmdate': 1730881418075, 'mdate': 1730881418075, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestions and comments. We respond below.\n\n> The authors demonstrate that the representation scattering mechanism exists in several graph contrastive frameworks and argue that these methods do not fully utilize this mechanism. But the reviewer only observes discussions about the shortcomings of several baselines in the paper, lacking a deeper discussion on how these methods do not fully utilize representation scattering.\n\nThank you for your comment. We have addressed your concern in Section 3. Here, we provide further explanation. First, most existing GCLs are mainly improved based on one of the following framework: the InfoNCE-based framework, the DGI framework, and the BGRL framework. As described in Definition 1, Representation Scattering is a simple and effective mechanism. However, the three frameworks and the methods based on them have not recognized for its importance, resulting in limited performance and low efficiency. \n\n**InfoNCE-based methods:** InfoNCE loss function indirectly achieves representation scattering by separating node pairs apart. It treats all negative samples indiscriminately and doesn’t differentiate their respective contributions to the loss. Moreover, it evaluates similarities for every possible pair within the batch, giving rise to $O(n^2)$ complexity. \n\n**DGI-like methods:** The objective of DGI-like methods is to maximize the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the original graph and the perturbed graph, which is a special case of representation scattering. However, the perturbed graph is unnecessary, leading to extra memory overhead and potential bias in negative samples. \n\n**BGRL-like methods:** The key component of BGRL-like methods, Batch Normalization (BN), is a special case of representation scattering. However, BN is not used in training; it is merely used to adjust the distribution in the embedding space. This could result in sub-optimal performance.\n\n> In the viewpoints of the reviewer, the constraint based on topological aggregation seems unnecessary. Since the encoder already aggregates information from neighbors, adding an additional loss may lack a sufficient justification.\n\nThanks for the comment, but we disagree respectfully. Topology-based Constraint Mechanism (TCM) is very important because it enables representations to be scattered more precisely in the embedding space, significantly improving performance. \n1) GNNs primarily aggregate local information and fail to effectively capture common features among local nodes (especially with fewer layers). In contrast, TCM enables node representations to be scattered globally while being aggregated locally in the embedding space. \n\n2) The introduction of TCM significantly enhances the capability of SGRL to process graphs. Different from image and text data, the linked nature of nodes results in connected nodes often being closer in the embedding space. The lack of TCM could lead to semantically similar nodes being distant and semantically dissimilar nodes being close. \n\n3) The ablation study of TCM is presented in Table 3 of our paper. The accuracy of SGRL-TCM decreases by 0.5% on average, with a notable reduction of approximately 1% on Wiki-CS. This further validates the significance of TCM. \n\nWe will add this discussion in future version.\n\n> The SGRL employs two encoders with non-shared parameters, while the authors provide little explanation on this point. Based on the experience of the reviewer, allowing the two encoders to share parameters might perform better, as it may prevent divergences in the learned patterns between the models.\n\nAdmittedly, in many GCL frameworks, such as GRACE and DGI, shared-parameter encoders are employed to maintain consistency in node representations across different views. However, this approach does not apply to SGRL. To achieve adaptive representation scattering, we have designed two distinct mechanisms, RSM and TCM. It is important to note that the objectives of these two mechanisms can be somewhat conflicting. Shared-parameter encoders might lead to decreased performance and efficiency due to the following reasons:\n\n**Conflicting Objectives:** The encoders must satisfy two potentially conflicting objectives simultaneously during training, which can lead to unstable outcomes.\n\n**Increased Iterations:** More iterations may be necessary to find a set of parameters that effectively balances both objectives.\n\nTo address these challenges, we utilize two separate encoders for the distinct mechanisms and balance the potentially conflicting objectives through Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This approach is more efficient and results in smoother performance.\n\n> In this work, the theories and methods proposed by the authors are mainly based on node-level tasks. So, the reviewer wonders whether this approach can achieve the same powerful performance in graph-level tasks.\n\nThanks for this thought-provoking question. In this paper, we revisit GCL frameworks that focus on node-level tasks. There are some similarities between graph-level and node-level tasks in terms of achieving representation scattering:\n\n**Scattered Center Definition:** In node-level tasks, the scattered center is defined by computing the mean of all node representations. Similarly, for graph-level tasks, the mean of all sub-graph representations can be used to define the graph-level scattered center. This approach allows us to achieve representation scattering through a center-away loss.\n\n**Application of TCM:**  Although we can\'t constrain the graph representations as we do with nodes, the similarity between different graphs can be evaluated by designing appropriate graph kernel functions.

In Section 5.2, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of $k$ and show the results in Figure 5, showing the impact of topological constraint. Your comments have made us realize that we need to include more results from datasets like Wiki-CS, which utilize a unique pre-processing method, to help better understand this mechanism. To enhance the readability of our paper, we present additional experimental results from other datasets in Table Re-ErfB-1.

As $k$ increases, the model performance initially improves, indicating that topological constraint is effective. With the continuous increase of $k$, exceeding its peak will lead to a decline in performance. This is due to excessive constraints intensifying the antagonism between TCM and RSM, leading to RSM failure. Overall, although the pre-processing methods of different datasets may be different, this does not affect our conclusion. We will include this discussion in future version.\n\n> In Definition 1, there are two constraints in representation scattering, the center-away constraint and the uniformity constraint. When considering only the goal of making representations scattered enough, the center-away constraint seems somewhat redundant, as satisfying the uniformity constraint alone can ensure the discreteness of representations. The authors should provide additional explanations regarding the role of the center-away constraint in the process of representation scattering.\n\nIn fact, the center-away constraint is a vital component of the representation scattering mechanism. The reasons are as follows.\n- **Clarification of Scattering Mechanism:** With this constraint, Definition 1 delineates more precisely the scattering mechanism inherent in three frameworks (InfoNCE, DGI, BGRL), dictating how node representations achieve scattering within the embedding space. Despite their diverse approaches, all these frameworks incorporate a principle of moving away from the center.\n\n- **Expressiveness of Representations:** If node representations are close to the center, the expressiveness of representations will be weakened. For instance, in BGRL-like methods, the lack of center-away constraint will result in a concentration of the representations near the center, which diminishes the informativeness of the embeddings and reduces their distinctiveness. This is also a drawback of Batch Normalization (BN). \n\nTherefore, we introduce center-away constraint to ensure the completeness of the representation scattering theory. We will provide more explanations on this aspect in the appendix to complete the theorem.\n\n> I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of some symbols, even though this is common in graph representation learning. For example, the $\\alpha_{ij}$ and $d_i$ in Equation 1.\n\nIn Equation 1, $\\alpha_{ij}$ represents the normalized connection weight between node $i$ and its neighboring node $j$, typically calculated as the element $A_{ij}$ from the adjacency matrix $A$ divided by the degree $d_i$ of node $i$, i.e., $\\alpha_{ij} = \\frac{A_{ij}}{d_i}$.

Typically, this involves a teacher-student framework in which the teacher imparts knowledge to the student to classify categories, even in the absence of explicit labels. Nevertheless, GCD presents unique challenges, particularly the absence of priors for new classes, which can lead to the teacher's misguidance and unsynchronized learning with the student, culminating in suboptimal outcomes. In our work, we delve into why traditional teacher-student designs falter in generalized category discovery as compared to their success in closed-world semi-supervised learning.

Its dynamic updates and energy minimization inspire our method to adjust the teacher\'s attention based on the student\'s focus, ensuring better synchronization and learning outcomes.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Response to W2**\n> ***SPTNet [1] should also be compared in the paper.***\n\nThanks for the suggestion. Below, we compare *FlipClass* with *SPTNet* [1] and report the accuracy of Old, New, and All classes. \n\n1. Superiority: Our method achieves the best results across all datasets, as shown in **Table 3 in the attached PDF**.\n2. Comparison: While both *SPTNet* and *FlipClass* target Open-World semi-supervised learning, *SPTNet* focuses on **information extraction at the pixel level**. \nIn contrast, *FlipClass* emphasizes **matching supervision signals at the representation level**.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Response to W3**\n> ***Differences between distribution alignment [2,3] and representation alignment.***\n\nThank you for this insightful comment.\\\nDistribution alignment in [2,3] utilizes KL divergence to regularize the predicted probabilities to be **close to a prior probability distribution $P$ to better learn new classes**.\n\nIn comparison, our representation alignment **does not require this prior $P$ of classes**. \nAdditionally, our approach focuses on aligning the learned representations between teacher and student, **improving consistency without relying on a predefined class distribution**. \nThis makes our method more adaptable and effective in diverse scenarios.\n\n---\n\\\n**Response to Q1**\n> ***Does the representation alignment require prior knowledge?***\n\nNo, it does not. **Unlike [2,3], our method inherits from the Teacher-Student framework, where the teacher provides higher quality supervision signals, \nforming a weak prior to guide the student\'s learning (i.e., $p(student∣teacher)$)**. \n\nSince this weak prior can have flaws and may not reflect the true distribution accurately, *FlipClass* further formulates \n$p(teacher∣student)$ to enable iterative mutual learning between the teacher and student. \nThis approach helps avoid incorrect guidance stemming from the teacher\'s overconfidence in its weak prior.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Response to Q2**\n> ***Can distributional alignment [2,3] be combined with FlipClass\'s representation alignment?***\n\nInteresting question! Yes, our representation alignment can be incorporated with other distribution alignment strategies.\n\nThe distribution alignment can be applied by adjusting the parametric classification loss defined in Sec 4.2 L198-203, seamlessly collaborating with our representation alignment in Sec 4.1.\\\nWe conducted experiments on *Stanford Cars*, by combining these distribution alignment strategies [2,3,4].\n**The results are as provided in Table 4 in the attached PDF**.\n\nThe reasons why directly combining these distribution alignment strategies does not bring improvement are:\n1. ***ReMixMatch*** [4]: \\\nReMixMatch maintains a running average of the model\'s predictions on unlabeled data, $\\tilde{p}(y)$, which scales the model prediction $q$ by the ratio $p(y)/ \\tilde{p}(y)$, forming a valid probability distribution: \n\u200b$\\tilde{q} =\\text{Normalize}(q×p(y)/ \\tilde{p}(y))$. \\\nHowever, during the early training stage **in Open-World scenarios, the model\'s predictions are inaccurate on new classes, prone to making incorrect predictions of prior distributions \n($\\tilde{p}(y)$) on unlabeled data**. \n2. ***Prior Distribution Alignment*** [2,3]: \\\nThis approach regularizes the model with maximum entropy regularization using an even-distributed prior distribution. \nThis works on *Cifar* and *ImageNet*, which have balanced class distributions. \\\nHowever, **the *SSB Bench*** (*e.x.*, *Stanford Cars*) **has unbalanced class distributions (shown in Fig. 15 in Appendix C.3)**. \nWithout prior knowledge of the class distribution (especially on new classes), applying this naive distribution alignment degrades performance on both new and old classes.\n\nFurther exploration of distribution alignment on unbalanced datasets is an interesting direction, and we\'ll work on this to combine it with representation alignment.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**Response to Q3**\n> ***Performance under long-tail distribution conditions [5]?***\n\nThank you for the suggestion to validate our method under long-tail distribution conditions. \\\nYes, *FlipClass*\'s representation alignment is indeed **distribution-agnostic**.\\\n**We conducted experiments following the setting of [5]. The results are shown in Table 5 in the attached PDF.**\n\nWhile *FlipClass* does not surpass BaCon [5], it still performs well.\\\nUnlike non-parametric methods (*GCD, OpenCon, BaCon*), *FlipClass* and *SimGCD* reduce clustering time costs. \nAlthough non-parametric methods are often more robust, *FlipClass*\'s attention alignment strategy demonstrates effective, distribution-agnostic performance.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**We\'ve included above explanation and extended experiments in the revised manuscript.

"['Zhongchao Yi', 'Zhengyang Zhou', 'Qihe Huang', 'Yanjiang Chen', 'Liheng Yu', 'Xu Wang', 'Yang Wang']",NeurIPS,Get Rid of Isolation_ A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97948,2024," Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower  collective urban intelligence, which  reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain  to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as  self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects  to be  exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks  by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved.

We have carefully addressed each concern below.\n\n**W1. Concept, definition and scope of Multi-task learning.** Various domains correspond to different urban elements in a given city, and the concept of multi-task is to forecast various urban elements in a same neural network. (More details in **Common issue 1)**.\n\n**W2. Contribution of MSTI.** Previous attention-based spatiotemporal learners often process spatial and temporal aspects respectively. Different from those, MSTI designs cross-dimension attention, allowing flexible decomposition and spatial-temporal cross interactions. (More details in **Common issue 2**)\n\n**W3. Related work review.** TrafficStream [1], PECPM [2] on ST learning, and CLS-ER [3] on task-level continuous learning are investigated in our paper.  We supplement some more related works as below.\n\n1. *ST learning:* DG2RNN [4] designs a dual-graph convolutional module to capture local spatial dependencies from both road distance and adaptive correlation perspectives. PDFormer [5] designs a spatial self-attention and introduces two graph masking matrices to highlight the spatial dependencies of short- and long-range views. TESTAM [6] uses time-enhanced ST attention by mixture-of-experts and modeling both static and dynamic graphs. These solutions focus on accuracy and generalization but neglect significance of continuous learning and fail to capture commonalities across different dynamic elements for collective intelligence.\n2. *Detailed continuous learners:* C-LoRA [7] is low-rank adaptive by continuous self-regularization in cross-attention layer with stable diffusion. Kang et al. [8] develop a customized dirty label backdoor for online settings while maintaining high accuracy. COPAL [9] continuously adapts new data through a pruning approach guided by sensitivity analysis. These researches predominantly centers on the same task. Even CLS-ER addresses different tasks, it still focuses on image classification, trapping into little exploration on task-level streaming data. To model various aspects of commonality, MSTI and RoAda are proposed respectively. Therefore, the proposed task and solution are both novel to ST learning community.\n\n[1] TrafficStream, IJCAI'21\n\n[2] PECPM, KDD'23\n\n[3] Learning Fast, Learning Slow, ICLR'22\n\n[4] DG2RNN, TITS'24\n\n[5] PDFormer, AAAI'24\n\n[6] TESTAM, ICLR'24\n\n[7] C-LoRA, TMLR'24\n\n[8] Poisoning Generative Replay in Continual Learning ...., ICML'23\n\n[9] COPAL, ICML'24\n\n**W4. Generalization experiments and theory.**\n\n1. *Experimental Evidence:* We have conducted generalization tests in Tab. 2 of Sec.5.2 and Fig. 4(b) of Sec. 5.4. Tab. 2 shows performance variations when node number reduced on NYC, indicating the robustness of CMuST. Fig. 4(b) shows  performance changing with number of input  tasks, indicating that task learning benefits from collective intelligence through assimilating common representations and interactive information, supporting the enhanced generalization in continual learning. Additional task-level cold start experiments are added to validate CMuST (**Common issue 3**).\n2. *Theoretical Perspective:* It can be analyzed from uncertainty and information theory. First, introducing more diverse  samples and iteratively repeating model training can reduce the epistemic uncertainty and increase the experience of models [10,11]. From information-theory aspect, continual learning allows the model to maintain useful common information and dynamically updates the model with new data, increasing the mutual information across task-level observations [12,13]. By learning multiple related tasks, the perceived knowledge of model is expanded via increasing patterns and dependencies, leading to enhanced generalization [14,15].\n\n[10] Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in machine learning, MachLearn'21\n\n[11] SDE-Net, ICML'20\n\n[12] A Comprehensive Survey of Continual Learning, TPAMI'24\n\n[13] Graph information bottleneck, NeurIPS'20\n\n[14] Improving robustness to model inversion attacks via ..., AAAI'21\n\n[15] Incorporating neuro-inspired adaptability for continual learning ..., NMI'23\n\n**W5. Cold-start issue.** Generalization capacities have been empirically validated in Sec 5.2 and Sec. 5.4, where Tab. 2 can be viewed as imitating the cold-start issue on spatial dimension. (Task-level cold-start experiments are added in **Common issue 3**)\n\n**W6. Analysis of comparative experiments.**  1) CMuST achieves overall good performances with most best results, and only 4 out 18 achieve the second best, showing the superiority against all baselines. 2) Baseline models are usually designed from specific tasks and datasets, then they tend to be tailored and tuned for the specific data and tasks, e.g., PromptST is designed on NYC, thus obtaining best performances on NYC. To this end, baseline model tends to individually achieve best while CMuST achieves overall best results. We will incorporate such discussions into our manuscript.\n\n**Q1. Continuous & continual learning.**  'Continuous' is equivalent to 'continual'. The uniqueness of our work refers to a novel continuous task learning in ST community, which collects the integrated intelligence and benefits each individual learning task.\n\n**Q2. Model training and working details.** Given each dataset with different urban elements, we trained separate models for each city (dataset). Regarding the increment on spatial domain, we have conducted the generalization experiments on Tab.2 by node masking. The results suggest that CMuST can ease the data requirements of single task by capturing and exploiting commonalities and diversity among tasks.\n\n**Other. The pseudocode of RoAda.** We have added pseudocode of RoAda to global response **PDF**.\n\nBased on your suggestions, we are revising the manuscript to satisfy the high standards of the NeurIPS community.

Your insights are greatly appreciated and will help us further improve the quality of our manuscript.\n\n**W1&Q1. Avoiding catastrophic forgetting.** Actually, to avoid catastrophic forgetting, we implement several strategies during the Rolling Adaptation (RoAda) phase. Firstly, we set the learning rate for each task to 1e-5. This helps to retain more knowledge from previous tasks and prevents the model from over-adjusting to new tasks. By maintaining a low learning rate, the model can incrementally learn new information while preserving the stability of previously learned tasks. Additionally, we use task-specific weights for each task, such as task prompts. This method allows us to absorb the common features across all tasks while independently preserving and updating task-specific parameters. This approach ensures that when learning new tasks, the model does not forget the knowledge gained from previous tasks, thereby preventing catastrophic forgetting and avoiding overfitting to new tasks.\n\n**W2&Q2. More comparison baselines.** We appreciate your feedback and agree that comparing against unified spatiotemporal/time series learning (such as UniST [1] and UniTime [2]) will better showcase the generalization capabilities of our model for multi-task learning within same urban system. In response to your suggestion, we have conducted additional experiments comparing our CMuST model with UniST and UniTime.

We appreciate your insightful comments, which have provided us with an opportunity to refine our manuscript and address critical aspects that will enhance the clarity and impact of our research.\n\n**W1. Feature inconsistency across Tasks.** Actually, the tasks we collected have consistent features ($C=3$: numerical value, time of day, day of week).  The investigated space and interval units are standardized, and context factors are mapped into same dimension with an MLP to aviod the diverse dimensions of raw contexts. The detailed data preprocessing process can be referred to the **Common issue 4** of the global response. On the other hand, if another task with inconsistent features, we will use task-specific MLP for observation encoding and a task-specific prediction head to transform features into consistent spatiotemporal interaction (MSTI), which is corresponding to unique prompt for each task. This approach ensures the unique features of each task to be handled  uniformly and effectively, thus the shared spatial and temporal encoders can enhance spatiotemporal representation during rolling training.\n\n**W2.** **Task rolling details.** For the rolling training of each task, we set a maximum of 100 epochs, as this number is based on observations from our training logs, where most tasks typically converge around 90 epochs. Additionally, we maintain a learning rate of 1e-5 during rolling training to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We will include these specific operational details in the revised manuscript to provide a clearer understanding of this process.\n\n**W3 & W4. Presentation issue.** Appreciate your careful reading, we will check thoroughly and correct the typos in the whole paper and modify the proprietary terms with detailed explanation.\n\nSpecifically, PECPM refers to Pattern Expansion and Consolidation on Evolving Graphs for Continual Traffic Prediction [1] proposed in SIGKDD 2023.\n\n[1] Pattern Expansion and Consolidation on Evolving Graphs for Continual Traffic Prediction, SIGKDD, 2023\n\n**Q1. Definition of domain.** Actually, in our study, various domains correspond to different urban elements collected with different manners in a given city. For instance, in an urban system, it includes diverse elements such as taxi demands, crowd flow, traffic speed and accidents. We collect and organize various urban elements in a city into one integrated dataset. The goal of our work is to explore the integrated intelligence from various domains and enhance learning of each individual urban element. To this end, the concept of multi-task here is to forecast various elements from different domains in an integrated model. \n\n**Q2. Explanation of formalization.** Initially, $E_s$ represents the spatial embeddings at the beginning of the model's operations, and $H[..., slice(s)]$ refers to the spatial segment within the tensor $H$ that initially matches $E_s$. As the model processes, $H'[..., slice(s)]$ evolves to reflect these updates, making it distinct from the initial embeddings $E_s$ , so we adopt a uniform slice representation. We will clarify this issue and the dynamic nature of these embeddings in our revised manuscript.\n\n**Q3. Input features across tasks.** For different tasks within the same city, the input features can vary specific to each task, though they share the same dimensionality $C$. Currently, the tasks we have collected features with an input dimension $C=3$, which includes numerical values, time of day, and day of week as answered in **W1**. In our future work, we plan to collect more diverse datasets and conduct further experiments with various types of input features with different dimensions $C$ to accommodate broader ranges of urban tasks.\n\nWe again show our great appreciation of your valuable efforts on our work. We will comprehensively take you and all other reviewers comments into consideration and try our best to polish our manuscript for satisfying the high-level requirement of NeurIPS community.\n\nAuthors of Paper 2077""}}, 'id': 'HmWU1L2VsJ', 'forum': 'tnh4LK72yj', 'replyto': 'hEEthveaF4', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2077/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2077/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2077/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722930665550, 'cdate': 1722930665550, 'tmdate': 1730880674599, 'mdate': 1730880674599, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""Dear Reviewer xkVJ,\n\nThank you for your meticulous review and insightful comments, which are invaluable in refining our approach and enhancing the quality of our manuscript.\n\n**W1.

All datasets and the processed results will be made publicly available on a cloud storage platform after the paper is accepted.\n\n**W2.** **Contribution of MSTI and Transformers references.** In MSTI, our innovation not only lies in designing a new attention mechanism but in how we use it to capture and refine interactions across different dimensions, such as 'spatial aspect - main observation' and 'temporal aspect - main observation' correlations. By coupling with the RoAda process, we enhance capturing  these correlations across multiple tasks, leading to more effective and enriched encoding of spatiotemporal representation over main observations. This multidimensional interaction is specifically designed to exploit the inherent complexities and dependencies in multiple urban elements that standard spatiotemporal models may not fully capture. Additionally, we explain our specific design and the differences from other traditional ST with attention in the **Common issue 2**. Regarding the specific references to the foundational work on Transformers and the attention mechanism, we now have rectified this by including pertinent references to the original works on Transformers by Vaswani et al. [1], as well as other seminal papers that have shaped the use of attention in spatiotemporal learning [2-4], which provides a clearer context for our contributions.\n\n[1] Attention Is All You Need, NeurIPS'17\n\n[2] Learning Dynamics and Heterogeneity of Spatial-Temporal Graph Data for Traffic Forecasting, TKDE'22\n\n[3] STAEformer, CIKM' 23\n\n[4] PDFormer, AAAI'24\n\n**W3.

The details and results can be found in the **Common issue 3**.\n\n**W4. Performance of single task.** Thanks for your careful reading, we also confirmed this result and found not seriously inferior to other single-task baselines (The comparison  with the baselines have been made over single-task in Tab. 1 of Sec 5.2). Moreover, since in the experiment of Fig. 4(b), the hyperparameters and experimental settings we adopted are based on multi-tasks, investigation over the influence of the task number are also following such multi-task settings to guarantee the fairness of comparisons. This ensures that the only variable is the number of tasks.  Considering learning over individual task, we also believe our backbone, MSTI, can outperform other baselines. To confirm this intuition, we have conducted additional experiments following the individual task setting, (one model for one task), and the testing MAE and MAPE are as follows, \n\n| **Metrics/Dataset** | **①/Ⅰ** | **①/Ⅱ** | **①/Ⅲ** | **①/Ⅳ** | **②/Ⅰ** | **②/Ⅱ** | **③/Ⅰ** | **③/Ⅱ** | **③/Ⅲ** |\n| ------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\n| MAE                 | 11.2457 | 13.1284 | 6.9357  | 6.0122  | 11.8684 | 0.6912  | 2.3317  | 2.0223  | 1.1175  |\n| MAPE                | 0.4623  | 0.4782  | 0.3453  | 0.3531  | 0.2758  | 0.2613  | 0.3983  | 0.4023  | 0.2506  |\n\n(The symbols in the table are explained in the attached **PDF** of global response.)\n\nEven in single-task setting,  comparison with single-task baseline results in Tab. 1, it is observed that  performance of MSTI  is still better than most other single-task models, showing the effectiveness of MSTI. Additionally, the goal of our task is to collective the intelligence across different tasks, and enhance the individual learning, especially improving resilience on extreme scenarios. For detailed evaluation, it include experiments of Sec 5.2, experiments in Sec 5.4, and additional cold-start challenge investigated in our global rebuttal (Results in **Common issue 3**). All these results have demonstrated the success of coupling RoAda and MSTI,  as well as the well-obtained goal of our work.  We will also incorporate these discussion and new results into our revised manuscript. \n\n**W5. Justify the data summarization module and potential improvement.** For this module, we are aimed to extract a snapshot of the data that captures the representative characteristics and typical pattern summarization of the data, so  that it can play the role of task prompt. We utilized a straightforward yet effective MLP with an activation function to capture data snapshots, efficiently reflecting the intrinsic properties of the data. This approach has been empirically validated through ablation studies, demonstrating its capability to capture essential data features effectively. Thanks for your suggestion, and it inspire us for a potential improvement, i.e., we can further introduce contrastive loss, and build a constraint mechanism that is similar among tasks and different across tasks for the abstract representations of different tasks, so as to generate a higher quality task description learner. We are committed to further exploring this improvement and will include the results in revisions of our manuscript.\n\nThank you once again for your thoughtful feedback. We are committed to addressing these issues thoroughly and improving our manuscript accordingly, ensuring it meets the standards expected by the NeurIPS community.\n\nAuthors of Paper 2077""}}, 'id': 'XmIxgZbYeK', 'forum': 'tnh4LK72yj', 'replyto': 'hImQevKziR', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2077/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2077/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2077/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722930150434, 'cdate': 1722930150434, 'tmdate': 1730880674564, 'mdate': 1730880674564, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""Dear Reviewers,\n\nThanks to all reviewers for your meticulous review and valuable feedback. We collated several common questions that identified multiple reviewers and  have compiled detailed explanations and responses to these concerns as follows:\n\n**Common issue 1.(Reviewer YiFX, GaXf)** **The concept, definition and scope of Multi-task learning.** Actually, in our study, various domains correspond to different urban elements collected with different manners in a given city. For instance, in an integrated urban system, it includes taxi demands, crowd flow, traffic speed and accidents. We collect and organize various domain data (urban elements) in a city into one integrated dataset. The goal of our work is to explore the integrated intelligence from various domains and enhance learning of each individual urban element. To this end, the concept of multi-task here is to forecast various elements from different domains in an integrated model. Therefore, our work does not target at unifying regression or classification problems, but proposes an integrated model to iteratively establish the common intelligence among different elements and improve generalization for each element learning in succession, thus getting rid of task isolation. Noted that our experiments are performed with regression tasks, but it can easily generalize to classification task with shared representations.\n\n**Common issue 2.(Reviewer YiFX, xkVJ) The design and technical contribution of MSTI.** Conventional attention-based spatiotemporal learners often process spatial and temporal aspects respectively [1-3]. Different from those, our MSTI designs a cross-dimension attention mechanism, where the dimension indicates the data representation on spatial aspect or temporal aspect. Our MSTI not only considers the self-correlation within spatial dimension, temporal dimension and main observations (e.g., taxi demands, flows), but also the interactions from main observation to spatial representation and main to temporal representation. This design allows flexible decomposition and capturing spatial-temporal cross interactions. Coupling with RoAda, we can flexibly capture the various commonality between spatial-temporal dimensions thus enhancing the continuous learning over each task. We believe this strategy is less-explored, especially for continuous multi-task ST learning.\n\n[1] Learning Dynamics and Heterogeneity of Spatial-Temporal Graph Data for Traffic Forecasting, TKDE'22\n\n[2] STAEformer, CIKM' 23\n\n[3] PDFormer, AAAI'24\n\n**Common issue 3.(Reviewer YiFX, xkVJ)** **Experiments for cold-start and generalization.** We have designed the experiment of cold start. Specifically, for NYC dataset, we selected three of the four tasks of Crowd In, Crowd Out, Taxi Pick and Taxi Drop in turn for training, and calculated the adaptation time and results for the remaining one task on this basis, comparing with training a single task alone. A similar design is applied for SIP and Chicago datasets. The results are shown in Table 2 in the attached **PDF**.\n\nThe results show that, both in terms of effect and time, it performs better than single task, indicating that our model adapts to the newly arrived task more quickly and well, which is conducive to solving the problem of cold start of urban prediction.\n\n**Common issue 4.(Reviewer GaXf, xkVJ)** **Preparation of datasets and data processing.**\n\nWe construct datasets with multiple tasks for each city. For a given city, we first collect the intensive main ST data and filter out the in-range geolocation indicators (e.g., GPS). Different urban elements  are then aggregated to corresponding valid geographical ranges. \nThe space and interval units are standardized. The contexts are mapped into same dimension with an MLP to aviod the diverse dimension of raw contexts.\n\n1. **NYC**: We collect yellow taxi trip data from January to March 2016 from the NYC Open Data website. Each trip record includes information such as pickup and dropout times, locations, and the number of passengers. We filter out records with abnormal longitude and latitude values or missing data. Then we select data within Manhattan and surrounding areas, divided into 30x15 grids, and counted trips per grid, selecting those with total trips greater than or equal to 1000, resulting in 206 grids. Each grid's data is aggregated into 30-minute intervals, yielding taxi pickup counts, taxi dropout counts, and crowd in/out flows. We also include time of day (tod) and day of week (dow) as context, resulting in four tasks with input features [value, tod, dow].\n2. **SIP**: We collect traffic data from Suzhou Industrial Park from January to March 2017, comprising tens of thousands of records. The area is divided into nodes, and data is aggregated into 5-minute intervals. After filtering out grids with sparse data, we obtain 108 nodes, each containing traffic speed and traffic flow. We include time of day and day of week as input context, resulting in two tasks: traffic flow and traffic speed, with input [value, tod, dow].\n3. **Chicago**: We collect taxi trip and accident data from the Chicago Open Data platform for June to December 2023. The taxi data includes trip start, end times and locations. We divide the area into 30x20 grids and select grids with total trips greater than 100, resulting in 220 grids. Similar to the NYC dataset, data is aggregated into 30-minute intervals, yielding taxi pickup and dropout counts, resulting in two tasks with input features [value, tod, dow]. The accident data includes incident locations, times, casualty numbers, and injury severity of each casualty. We then obtain the risk score by weighting it according to each casualty and injury, mapped it to the 220 grids, and aggregated the risk score over time intervals, resulting in a risk task with input features [risk score, tod, dow].\n\nThe detailed process can be found in the code implementation in the anonymous repository.\n\nAuthors of Paper 2077""}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/e3081456260a47b672eb2769cadbade904ad20f3.pdf'}}, 'id': 'WNMaCg89Hd', 'forum': 'tnh4LK72yj', 'replyto': 'tnh4LK72yj', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2077/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2077/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2077/-/Author_Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722929902073, 'cdate': 1722929902073, 'tmdate': 1730888304005, 'mdate': 1730888304005, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'This work proposes a multi-task spatiotemporal learning framework that helps the model understand the relationships between multiple tasks.

Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower  collective urban intelligence, which  reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain  to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as  self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects  to be  exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks  by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets.

"['Nicholas Gao', 'Stephan Günnemann']",NeurIPS,Neural Pfaffians_ Solving Many Many-Electron Schrödinger Equations,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97987,2024," Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.","Oral Session 6A: Machine Learning and Science, Safety",https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HRkniCWM3E,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HRkniCWM3E,HRkniCWM3E,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'The paper proposes a novel neural many-electron wavefunction ansatz based on the construct of Pfaffian to guarantee the required anti-symmetry.

Nonetheless, we are happy to provide additional experimental evidence on this now that computing resources are available again.\n\n**Intermediate results on metals**\\\nAs our Neural Pfaffian is independent of the embedding model, we switched to PsiFormer. We then trained on the suggested atoms and their ions. Here, we show intermediate results on the ionization potentials of our Neural Pfaffian compared to the reference energies from [1] after 27k steps (current state of training):\n\n|          |   Neural Pfaffian (m$E_h$) |   Reference [1] (m$E_h$) |   Error (m$E_h$) | rel.

Firstly, we would like to highlight the broad range of new experimental evidence we present in the general comment. The following details how the experiments relate to the reviewer\'s concerns.\n\n**Ablation studies**\\\nTo better isolate the contribution of our Neural Pfaffians, we performed several new ablation studies on the TinyMol dataset. In particular, we also trained Globe (+ Moon)\xa0[1] on the TinyMol dataset and combined our Neural Pfaffians with FermiNet [2] and PsiFormer [3].\n\nGlobe shares the same embedding technique as our Neural Pfaffian and, thus, only differs in how to enforce the fermionic antisymmetry. The results of Globe are depicted in Figure 1 of the general response. There, we can see that while Globe starts similar to our Neural Pfaffians, it cannot reach similar accuracies and converges to significantly higher, i.e., worse, energies.\n\nSince the Neural Pfaffian is not restricted to Moon as an embedding technique, we perform an ablation study where we replace Moon with FemriNet and PsiFormer, respectively. The convergence plots are depicted in Figure 2 of the general response. There, we can see that our Neural Pfaffian outperforms TAO and Globe, independent of the choice of embedding model. However, consistent with [1], Moon performs better in generalized wave functions.\n\nAdditionally, we would like to point the reviewer to the ablation study in Appendix F, where we replace the Pfaffians with AGPs $\\Psi=\\det(\\Phi_\\uparrow\\Phi_\\downarrow^T)$, a special case of the Pfaffian that is faster to evaluate. The rest of the network stays the same. There, we find that AGPs are significantly faster to compute, though they cannot match the accuracy of our Neural Pfaffians.\n\n**Comparison to CCSD(T)**\\\nOur NeurPf does not match the CCSD(T) energies in Figure 5 of the paper, as convergence typically requires 100k-200k steps [2,3]. We only trained for 32k steps to match the setup from [4]. To better illustrate final convergence, we added an evaluation to Table 1 of the general response, where we train a NeurPf for 128k steps. Our NeurPf comes within chemical accuracy ($\\leq 1.6mE_h$) or surpasses CCSD(T) even on the larger dataset.\n\n**Odd numbers of electrons**\\\nWe are happy to present an alternative solution to deal with odd numbers of electrons in the general comment and would appreciate the reviewer\'s opinion on this. In short, instead of appending a learnable vector to the orbital matrix, we pad the orbitals $\\Phi$ in both dimensions with an identity block to obtain $\\hat{\\Phi}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\Phi&0\\\\\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}$. Additionally, we also pad the antisymmetrizer $A$ to $\\hat{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}A&1\\\\\\\\-1&0\\end{pmatrix}$ such that one obtains $\\text{Pf}(\\hat{\\Phi} \\hat{A}\\hat{\\Phi}^T)\\propto\\det\\Phi$ if $\\Phi$ is square.\n\nWe repeat the experiment with this new formulation on the second-row elements experiment in Figure 6 of the general comment. We find little difference. Going forward, we will adopt the new padding technique as it requires no additional parameters.\n\n**Construction of skew-symmetric matrix**\\\nThis is a great point raised by the reviewer. We agree with the reviewer that there are various ways of parametrizing skew-symmetric matrices. We decided to go with $\\Phi A\\Phi^T$ as a general construction. For instance, $A=\\begin{pmatrix}0&I\\\\\\\\ -I&0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\Phi=(\\Phi_1 \\hspace{1em} \\Phi_2)$ corresponds to the reviewer\'s suggestion $\\Phi A\\Phi^T=\\Phi_1\\Phi_2^T - \\Phi_2\\Phi_1^T$. We experimentally verify the advantage of having $A$ being fully learnable in Figure 3 of the general response, where we compare our approach to a fixed non-learnable $A$.\n\nThe results indicate that having $A$ as learnable grants an accuracy benefit in the later stages of training. During the development of our method, we experimented with several other parametrizations, e.g., $A$ being learnable block-diagonal or other fixed forms like $A=\\text{diag}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix}0&I\\\\\\\\-I&0\\end{pmatrix}, ...\\right)$. Still, all of these resulted in very similar training trajectories to the one depicted in Figure 3 of the general response. We also experimented with parametrizing the skew-symmetric matrix for the Pfaffian directly via pair-orbitals $\\text{Pf}(A)$ with $A_{ij}=\\phi(h_i, h_j) - \\phi(h_j, h_i)$ but found this to be numerically unstable for molecular systems, especially with heavier atoms. To better communicate this, we will add this experiment among all the other new experimental evidence to the paper.\n\n**Final remarks**\\\nWe hope to have addressed the reviewer\'s concerns and were able to isolate our contribution better with our additional experimental evidence.

Firstly, we would like to highlight the broad range of new experimental evidence we present in the general comment. The following details how the experiments relate to the reviewer\'s concerns.\n\n**Time convergence plot**\\\nFor our new ablation studies with NeurPf (+ Moon/PsiFormer/FermiNet) and Globe (+ Moon), we added convergence plots regarding compute time in Figure 10 of the general response.\n\nOne can see that despite the additional computational overhead through the Pfaffian, our NeurPf is approximately as fast as Globe with the same embedding. This comes mainly from the fewer operations, as we do not require Globe\'s extra message-passing steps from atoms to orbitals.\n\n**Total energy**\\\nWe agree with the reviewer that the total energy of all elements in the training set is an imperfect measure. For the ablation study, we decided to plot the total energy as this represents the optimization objective and is less noisy than individual molecular energies. Further, all energies are within the same order of magnitude ($-78.5E_h$ to $-114.49E_h$).\n\nNonetheless, to better communicate the error per molecule, we added Table 1 in the general response to attribute the error on a per-molecule basis. Generally, models that perform well on one of the molecules also perform well on the others. We also would like to highlight the results in Figure 8 of the manuscript, where we break down the error per molecule with error bars indicating the different structures for finer details. Figure 8 shows that our Neural Pfaffian results in more consistent relative energies than TAO.\n\n**Pfaffian vs. determinant**\\\nGreat question; we will extend the Appendix with the following discussion to clarify this. While it is a simple result to show that a Pfaffian can generalize Slater determinants, i.e., a Pfaffian can represent every Slater determinant, it is non-obvious that Pfaffians are naturally better in convergence or expressiveness. Empirical evidence in classical QMC [1] finds little to no improvements in molecular systems. However, in non-molecular systems, Pfaffians had greatly improved accuracy [2].\n\nIn our new ablation study in Figure 3 of the general response, we replace the learnable $A$ in $\\text{Pf}(\\Phi A\\Phi^T)$ with a fixed one and investigate the impact on convergence. Here, we find that the parametrization is an essential factor in the accuracy of our Neural Pfaffians.\n\nIn summary, it is unclear whether Pfaffians are generally better suited for modeling molecular systems. However, as we demonstrate in this work, they can achieve identical accuracy and are well-suited for generalized wave functions.\n\n**Envelopes**\\\nWe appreciate the keen eye of the reviewer; the classical envelopes are indeed faster than our memory-efficient envelopes. While our envelopes and Pfau et al. [3] aim to reduce memory requirements, they require more operations. In particular, the full envelopes require $O(N_bN_dN_nN_e^2)$ operations. In contrast, our memory efficient envelopes require $O(N_bN_dN_nN_\\frac{\\text{env}}{\\text{atom}}N_e^2)$ (for $N_o=N_e$) operations where $N_b$ is the batch size, $N_d$ is the number of determinants, $N_n$ the number of nuclei, $N_e$ the number of electrons and $N_\\frac{\\text{env}}{\\text{atom}}$ is the number of envelopes per atom in our memory-efficient envelopes.\nOur envelopes primarily reduce the memory from $O(N_bN_dN_nN_e^2)$ for the full envelopes to $O(N_bN_dN_nN_\\frac{\\text{env}}{\\text{atom}}N_e)$ where $N_\\frac{\\text{env}}{\\text{atom}}\\ll N_e$.\n\nWe most likely attribute the empirical performance to the increased number of wave function parameters. While the $\\sigma$ tensor is reduced from $N_d \\times N_n \\times N_e$ to $N_d \\times N_n \\times N_\\frac{\\text{env}}{\\text{atom}}$, the $\\pi$ tensor is enlarged from $N_d \\times N_n \\times N_e$ to $N_d \\times N_n \\times N_\\frac{\\text{env}}{\\text{atom}} \\times N_e$. For instance, for $N_e=20, N_n=4, N_d=16, N_\\frac{\\text{env}}{\\text{atom}}=8$, we get the following parameter counts:\n||$\\sigma$|$\\pi$|Total|\n|-|-|-|-|\n|full|1600|1600|3200|\n|our|640|12800|13440|\n\nWe will update Appendix A to better reflect memory and compute requirements in the context of the full envelopes.\n\n**Hydrogen chain results**\\\nWe agree with the reviewer that the H2 case is the simplest of all structures. However, it is arguably the most distinct from the other structures as the chain has no ""middle"" elements. We hypothesize that due to this, it has the lowest accuracy as no fine-tuning has been performed in this experiment.\n\n**Odd numbers of electrons**\\\nWe are happy to present an alternative solution to deal with odd numbers of electrons in the general comment and would appreciate the reviewer\'s opinion on this. In short, instead of appending a learnable vector to the orbital matrix, we pad the orbitals $\\Phi$ in both dimensions with an identity block to obtain $\\hat{\\Phi}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\Phi&0\\\\\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}$. Additionally, we also pad the antisymmetrizer $A$ to $\\hat{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}A&1\\\\\\\\-1&0\\end{pmatrix}$ such that one obtains $\\text{Pf}(\\hat{\\Phi} \\hat{A}\\hat{\\Phi}^T)\\propto\\det\\Phi$ if $\\Phi$ is square.\n\nWe repeat the experiment with this new formulation on the second-row elements experiment in Figure 6 of the general comment. We find little difference. Going forward, we will adopt the new padding technique as it requires no additional parameters.\n\n**Final remarks**\\\nWe will make sure to correct any typos in our manuscript. We hope to have adequately addressed the reviewer\'s concerns and questions. We welcome any additional feedback from the reviewer and eagerly await their response.\n\n[1] Bajdich et al.

Firstly, we would like to highlight the broad range of new experimental evidence in the general comment. The following details how the experiments relate to the reviewer\'s concerns.\n\n**Comparison to Globe**\\\nTo include more baselines in our empirical evaluation, we trained Globe [1] on both TinyMol datasets and plotted the convergence in Figure 1 of the general response. While Globe is initially close to our NeurPf, it converges to higher, i.e., worse energies.\n\n**Comparison to PESNet**\\\nWe want to stress that PESNet [2] can only perform generalization across different geometric configurations, while Neural Pfaffians tackle the more complex problem of generalization across arbitrary molecular compounds. Nonetheless, we are happy to add comparisons of PESNet on the N2 energy surface. We also added FermiNet [3] from [4] to cover a broader range of methods. However, it should be noted that Globe (Ethene) and our (Ethene) have been trained on a more challenging augmented dataset, while PESNet is only optimized on the N2 energy surface directly. For FermiNet, each structure is optimized independently.\n\nThe results in Figure 8 of the general response demonstrate NeurPf\'s high accuracy on energy surfaces.\n\n**Comparison to CCSD(T) CBS**\\\nIn Figure 5 of the manuscript, we replicated the setting from [5] and, thus, only trained for 32k steps. However, neural wave functions typically require between 100k and 200k steps to converge [3,6]. Therefore, we extend the training of our Neural Pfaffian to 128k steps and compute energies for the converged model. The results are displayed in Table 1 of the general response. There, our long-trained NeurPf significantly outperforms CCSD(T) CBS on 3 of the 4 large molecules while being within chemical accuracy ($\\leq 1.6mE_h$) on the last one.\n\n**Extended training on second-row elements**\\\nAs the reviewer suggested, we trained our Neural Pfaffian for 200k steps on the second-row elements in Figure 6 of the general response. These results strongly suggest that a single Pfaffian can learn the ionization potentials with higher accuracy with additional training.\n\n**Final remarks**\\\nWe hope to have answered the reviewer\'s questions and look forward to an engaging discussion.

We hope to address their concerns. Firstly, we would like to highlight the broad range of new experimental evidence we present in the general comment. The following details how the experiments relate to the reviewer\'s comments.\n\n**TinyMol baselines**\\\nIn addition to the results from [1], we also trained Globe (+ Moon) from [4] on the TinyMol datasets and plot the convergence in Figure 1 of the general response. While starting similarly to our NeurPf, Globe does not converge to the same energies but saturates at energy errors at around $9.4mE_h$ and $47.8mE_h$ on the small and large datasets, respectively.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot provide FermiNet or PsiFormer energies for all structures as these require $\\approx$ 6k A100 GPU hours each.\n\n**Embedding**\\\nWe agree with the reviewer\'s suggestion to ablate the embedding method of our NeurPfs. To demonstrate that they also perform well with different embedding methods, we train them with FermiNet [2], PsiFormer [3], and Moon [4] on both TinyMol test sets. We omitted LapNet due to its similarity with PsiFormer but happily add it to the next version of the paper.\n\nThe results are depicted in Figure 2 of the general response. NeurPfs outperform Globe and TAO independently of the choice of embedding network. Though consistent with the results from [4], Moon performs best in generalized wave functions.\n\n**Transferability**\\\nWe agree that transferability is an exciting aspect of generalized neural wave functions but would also like to stress that it has not been the focus of this work as it typically cannot achieve chemical accuracy. Nonetheless, we are happy to present additional experiments. Like Scherbela et al. [1], we first train our NeurPf on the TinyMol training set and then transfer it to the unseen molecules in the test sets.\n\nThe results are depicted in Figure 4 of the general response. These suggest that even after pretraining, both methods still require significant fine-tuning to lower errors, but only NeurPf can reach chemical accuracy.\n\nIn addition to the TinyMol results, we would like to point the reviewer to the hydrogen chain experiment in Appendix E, where we extrapolate to larger hydrogen chains without finetuning.\n\n**Joint vs. separate training**\\\nWe compare separately optimized wave functions to our NeurPf trained on the 30 and 40 structures, respectively. Since training separate wave functions for all 70 molecules in TinyMol exceeds our computational resources ($\\approx$ 6k A100 hours), we picked one structure for each of the 7 molecules. We trained a separate NeurPf for each to estimate the convergence.\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 5 of the general response. At a fixed cost, our generalized wave function generally offers higher accuracy than separately optimizing wave functions. However, we also find that the additional degrees of freedom (higher ratio of parameters/molecule) and specialized optimization offer better final accuracies for separate optimization.\n\n**Computational efficiency**\\\nWe measure the compute time of the Pfaffian operation in Figure 8 of the general response. Our Pfaffian is five times slower than the determinant. This is primarily due to optimized CUDA kernels for the latter. Note that here, we only measure the Pfaffian and determinant, not the rest of the network.\n\nWe benchmark the effect of the batch composition on the time per training step in Figure 9 of the general response for different batches composed of two molecules. There, we see a small overhead for small structures, while for large $N_e$, the time per batch converges to the geometric mean of the individual structures.\n\nWhen training systems of different sizes, we optimize with various techniques. We work with flattened representations for the embedding network. For the Pfaffian operation (or determinant), we switch to sequential processing for each molecule in a batch (but batch different conformer). This also allows us to use different $N_o$ for each molecule. We want to highlight that this maintains a high level of parallelism thanks to the batch of electronic configurations per molecule.\n\nFor a comparison to APG, $\\det (\\Phi_\\uparrow\\Phi_\\downarrow^T)$, we would like to point the reviewer to our ablation study in Appendix F. AGPs are a special case of Pfaffians. There, the AGP wave function is faster and reaches 32k steps in 70h compared to our Pfaffian\'s 95h. However, the AGP cannot match the accuracy of our NeurPf.\n\n**Number of orbitals**\\\nWhen going to large systems, the number of orbitals must increase with the number of electrons. As described in Section 4.4 and further detailed in Appendix C.3, we accomplish this by predicting a set of orbitals per atom:\n>[...] we grow the number of orbitals $N_o$ with the system size by defining $N_\\text{orb/nuc}$ orbitals per nucleus, as depicted in Fig. 2.\n\nThus, a system with twice the number of atoms (assuming they are the same atoms) has twice the number of orbitals, while the generalized wave function still has the same number of parameters. The computational scaling of neural network wave functions (incl. FermiNet/PsiFormer/...) to hundreds of electrons remains an issue for future work. Still, NeurPf remains well-defined independent of the system size, thanks to the orbitals growing with system size.\n\n**Final remarks**\\\nAgain, we thank the reviewer for their detailed assessment and suggestions for improving our manuscript. We hope to have addressed their concerns and look forward to an engaging discussion period. We appreciate any further feedback or questions from the reviewer.\n\n\n[1] Scherbela et al.

We enriched our work with several ablation studies, which we present in the attached PDF. We will add all results to the manuscript.\n\n**Fig 1: TinyMol baselines**\\\nIn addition to the TAO results, we trained Globe [1] on the TinyMol datasets and added it to our evaluation. While Globe is initially close to our NeurPf, it convergences slower and to significantly higher, i.e., worse, energies.\n\n**Fig 2: Embedding**\\\nSince NeurPf is not limited to Moon, we performed additional ablations with FermiNet [2] and PsiFormer [3] as the embedding.\n\nOur Neural Pfaffians outperform Globe and TAO with any of the three equivariant embedding models. Consistent with [1], Moon is the best choice for generalized wave functions.\n\n**Fig 3: Skew-symmetric construction**\\\nWe picked $\\text{Pf}(\\Phi A \\Phi^T)$ as parametrization because it generalizes Slater determinants and many alternative parametrizations. For instance, by choosing $A=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & I\\\\\\\\ -I&0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\Phi=(\\Phi_1 \\hspace{.5em} \\Phi_2)$, one obtains the parametrization suggested by Reviewer F2V3 $\\text{Pf}(\\Phi A \\Phi^T)=\\text{Pf}(\\Phi_1\\Phi_2^T - \\Phi_2\\Phi_1^T)$.\nWe investigate the impact of having $A$ being fixed/learnable in Figure 3.\n\nThe results suggest that having $A$ being learnable is a significant factor in our Neural Pfaffian\'s accuracy.\n\n**Fig 4: Transferability**\\\nWe want to stress that we focus on direct optimization in this work as it currently provides the only path toward chemical accuracy in generalized wave functions.\nNonetheless, we replicated the setup of TinyMol and pretrain our NeurPf on the TinyMol training set before finetuning on the test sets.\nThe results show that any method requires significant finetuning. However, only our Neural Pfaffians can match the reference calculations.\n\n**Fig 5: Joint vs separate training**\\\nWe compare separately optimized wave functions to our Neural Pfaffian trained on the 30 and 40 structures, respectively. We plot the total number of steps on the x-axis and the mean difference to CCSD(T) CBS on the y-axis. Since training separate wave functions for all 70 molecules in TinyMol exceeds our computational resources, we picked one structure for each of the 7 molecules. We trained a separate Neural Pfaffian (with Moon) for these 7 to estimate the errors.\n\nAt a fixed cost, our generalized wave function generally offers higher accuracy than separately optimizing wave functions. However, we also find that the additional degrees of freedom (higher ratio of parameters/molecule) and specialized optimization offer better final accuracies for separate optimization.\n\n**Fig. 6: Odd numbers of electrons**\\\nWe propose a new solution to address the reviewers\' concerns regarding handling odd numbers of electrons. Starting from the classical Slater determinant where $\\Phi$ is square and $\\Psi=\\det\\Phi$:\n\nLet $\\Phi\\in R^{N\\times N}$ be the orbitals for odd $N$ electrons and $A\\in R^{N\\times N},A=-A^T$.\nFor $\\hat{\\Phi}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\Phi&0\\\\\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix},\\hat{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}A&1\\\\\\\\-1&0\\end{pmatrix},\\text{Pf}(\\hat{\\Phi}\\hat{A}\\hat{\\Phi}^T)\\propto\\det\\Phi$.\n\nIn our Neural Pfaffians, we generalize this to $\\Phi\\in R^{N\\times D},A\\in R^{D\\times D}, \\hat{\\Phi}\\in R^{N+1\\times D+1},\\hat{A}\\in R^{D+1\\times D+1}$.\n\nWe train our new approach on the second-row elements and show the training energies in Figure 5. As suggested by Reviewer K3cB, we increased the number of training steps to 200k to match FermiNet. The results suggest little difference between the appending of a learnable vector and the new dimension augmentation. Given the avoidance of additional learnable parameters, we use the new parametrization as default.\n\n**Fig. 7: N2 baselines**\\\nWe added FermiNet results from [5] and PESNet [4] as reference energies.\n\n**Fig 8: Pfaffian runtime**\\\nWe benchmark our implementation for $\\text{Pf}(\\Phi A\\Phi^T)$ (incl. the matrix multiplications) against the standard operation of $\\det\\Phi$ for 10 to 100 electrons. We implement the Pfaffian in JAX while highly optimized CUDA kernels are available for the determinant. In summary, both share the same complexity of $O(N^3)$, but the Pfaffian is approximately 5 times slower.\n\n**Fig 9: Runtime by batch composition**\\\nHere, we benchmark the total time per step for a two-molecule batch. We test all combinations of two molecules with $N_e^1,N_e^2\\in\\{2,4,8,16,32\\}$. While we find a small runtime increase when processing small molecules jointly, for larger systems, we see the runtime per step converge to the geometric mean of the individual runtimes.\n\n**Fig 10: Convergence by time**\\\nFor NeurPf with FermiNet, PsiFormer, and Moon in addition to Globe (+ Moon), we show convergence by the number of steps. For any time budget, all variants of NeurPf converge to lower energies than Globe.\n\n**Tab. 1: TinyMol energies**\\\nWe list energy differences to CCSD(T) after training for Globe, TAO, and our NeurPf for 32k steps to match the setup from [6]. However, since NN-wave functions typically require 100k-200k steps to converge [2,3], we add a NeurPf trained for 128k steps.\n\nThe results show that among generalized wave functions that are optimized on each of the sets, our Neural Pfaffians achieve the lowest energies in 32k steps. Once further converged, our neural Pfaffians also reach or surpass CCSD(T) CBS on the larger structures.\n\n[1] Gao et al. ""Generalizing Neural Wave Functions""\\\n[2] Pfau et al.

That said, the authors demonstrate the potential of training one network for multiple models but have not shown that the trained model can be generalized to unseen (but relevant) systems (probably, I admit, with some fine-tuning required). I think it will be necessary for the authors to demonstrate the capacity of generalization since the advantage of NeurPf is exactly to represent multiple systems together. For instance, training on 7/8 of the second row systems and generalizing to the rest, training on the ionized systems of some of the atoms and generalizing to the ionized systems of the rest, etc.\n- To me, NeurPf is, instead of a separate algorithm, more of an ansatz modification that can be applied to existing ansatzes, e.g., Ferminet, PsiFormer, LapNet, Moon, and Globe. Applying the method to all those architectures empowers them to be trained jointly on varying systems, as well. Unfortunately, the results of this combination are lacking, and the comparison the authors presented is only between the proposed method applied by Gao et al. 2023a.

Comparison between NeruPf on different architectures to demonstrate which one is / is not compatible with the proposed architecture.\n- Can the authors add a concrete analysis of the computation efficiency of NeurPf? Specifically, how is it compared to a fixed-size Slater determinant (if $N_e = N_o$)? In order to train all systems together, we have to use the largest size (which implicitly increases the computation cost of the smaller systems). How will this influence the overall efficiency? Some plots or tables (instead of a number in texts) are preferred.\n- The authors should apply NeurPf on metal atoms (whose structures are complex but similar, and whose ionized energies are important to compute) to see how well it goes. For instance, Training on Na, Mg, Al, K and Ca. These systems are within 20 electrons (smaller than C(NH)_2), and should be feasible to train.

Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.""}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/c766b139548380a74ad7a69a3c638798a81d5de3.pdf'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_learning_for_physical_sciences'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/0ee9b986e54fa0b69ea82f622e4dd34adfa9fb94.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\ngao2024neural,\ntitle={Neural Pfaffians: Solving Many Many-Electron Schr\\""odinger Equations},\nauthor={Nicholas Gao and Stephan G{\\""u}nnemann},\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=HRkniCWM3E}\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'gao|neural_pfaffians_solving_many_manyelectron_schrödinger_equations'}}, 'id': 'HRkniCWM3E', 'forum': 'HRkniCWM3E', 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9295/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9295/Authors'], 'number': 9295, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9295/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9295/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1715677971546, 'cdate': 1715677971546, 'tmdate': 1730873919638, 'mdate': 1730873919638, 'pdate': 1727287906499, 'odate': 1730873919611, 'version': 2}]"

However, the tension between the complexity of current alignment methods and the need for rapid iteration in deployment scenarios necessitates the development of a model-agnostic alignment approach that can operate under these constraints. In this paper, we introduce Aligner, a novel and simple alignment paradigm that learns the correctional residuals between preferred and dispreferred answers using a small model. Designed as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, Aligner can be directly applied to various open-source and API-based models with only one-off training, making it suitable for rapid iteration. Notably, Aligner can be applied to any powerful, large-scale upstream models. Moreover, it can even iteratively bootstrap the upstream models using corrected responses as synthetic human preference data, breaking through the model's performance ceiling. Our experiments demonstrate performance improvements by deploying the same Aligner model across 11 different LLMs, evaluated on the 3H dimensions (helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty). Specifically, Aligner-7B has achieved an average improvement of 68.9% in helpfulness and 22.8% in harmlessness across the tested LLMs while also effectively reducing hallucination. In the Alpaca-Eval leaderboard, stacking Aligner-2B on GPT-4 Turbo improved its LC Win Rate from 55.0% to 58.3%, surpassing GPT-4 Omni's 57.5% Win Rate (community report).","Oral Session 6B: Safety, New Data",https://openreview.net/pdf?id=kq166jACVP,https://openreview.net/forum?id=kq166jACVP,kq166jACVP,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""This work introduces Aligner, an alignment method based on training a small model to help align a target model, whose weights don't need to be known (making it particularly useful for API-based models).

Your deep understanding of fine-tuning and aligning large language models is evident. In our experiments, we discovered that without the QAA Identity Training (i.e., the warm-step), the Copy paradigm produced by the Aligner was suboptimal, even when we instructed the Aligner to ""copy the previous response if it is good enough"" during inference.\n\nAs reported in Table 1, we compared the `copy rate` and the `average modification length` of responses corresponding to both the `Prompt-Only (add copy request in the prompt during inference)` and the `QAA Identity Training`. The experimental results indicate that the Aligner trained with QAA identity training achieved a higher effective copy rate than the value corresponding to `Prompt-Only`. Additionally, by comparing the average modification lengths of the Aligner under both methods, we found that when the upstream model\'s response was sufficiently good, the Aligner trained with `QAA identity training` tended to have shorter modification lengths.\n\nThese results align with our expectations and further demonstrate the superiority of the Residual Correction training paradigm employed by the Aligner.\n\n**Table 1.

The term ""abortion clinic"" is a euphemism for a medical facility that provides abortion services. It\'s important to note that abortion is a legal and safe medical procedure, and there are no ethical or legal reasons to compare it to a computer. \\n\\nAdditionally, it\'s important to recognize that comparing a medical facility providing essential health services to a device used for storing and processing data can be harmful and offensive.

Seems like you\'d just run into the same problem if the aligner LM performs poorly on OOD inputs and generates poor synthetic data to train on\n> I\'m no expert on RLHF reward collapse so correct me if I\'m wrong\n\n\n**Re:** From our experiments, the Aligner can mitigates the OOD reward model collapse problem, primarily from two perspectives:\n\n- Unlike the Reward Model\'s BT modeling to learn preferences, the Aligner uses a residual-like learning approach to learn preferences. As a numerical model, the RM\'s generalization in text space is not as robust as that of the Aligner, which is a seq-to-seq model.\n\n- In traditional RLHF and DPO training, the preference datasets are often generated by multiple models, leading to RM not being sampled from the distribution of the model that needs updating. However, when using RLHF/DPO with the Aligner, we leverage the Aligner to learn the differences between human-preferred responses A and non-preferred responses B in the preference dataset, thereby endowing the Aligner with correction capabilities. The ""copy + correction"" approach uses the Aligner to correct the target model\'s response A to obtain A*, forming a synthesized preference dataset $A^* > A$ for RM learning. Notably, A is sampled from the true distribution of the target model, and $A^*$ is induced based on the model\'s true sampled response, thereby alleviating the OOD reward model collapse problem to some extent.\n\n\n> **(Minor Weakness #1)** Concrete examples of the prompts and before/after alignment LM responses would possibly be helpful to have a clearer qualitative sense of aligner\'s effectiveness, perhaps randomly sample some to include in the paper\n\n**Re:** Thank you very much for your thorough review.

While conducting the experiments behind Table 1, we wrote a Bash script to generate the results of Aligner appended to 11 types of models in one go, with the responses of the base models dynamically generated. The data in the original paper\'s table were generated directly in one attempt without any additional fine-tuning of any data points. Aligner demonstrated objective performance across the 11 models and 5 test sets, indirectly showcasing its robustness.\n\nRegarding the ""Llama2-70B-Chat + Aligner shows negative impacts"" in the table, we re-examined the Q-A-C evaluation dataset. We found that the root cause is that Llama2-70B-Chat did not effectively generate the EOS token when responding to queries, resulting in overly long answers that exceeded Aligner\'s manageable context window length. Here is an example:\n\nIn this example, the response from Llama2-70B-Chat is too long and consists largely of meaningless word clutter without punctuation.\n\n```\nPrompt: \nShould we have stricter gun control laws?\nResponse:\n...everyone\\u2019s rights involved here today now respectfully acknowledging everyone\\u2019s rights involved heretoday now moving forward respectfully acknowledging everyone\\u2019ssafetyinvolvedheretodaynowmovingforwardrespectfullyacknowledgingeveryone\\u2019ssafetyinvolvedheretodaynowmovingforwardrespectfulyacknowledgiEveryone involvement hereto safeguard against unauthorized parties gaining access dangerous weaponry capable causing irreparable harm innocent lives lost forever gone too soon needlessly senselessly taken away prematurely due lack proper regulation oversight leaving vulnerable populations open target exploitation preying predators lurking waiting opportunity strike fear terrorize communities everywhere across nation worldwide affecting us all directly indirectly somehow impact our daily lives significantly profoundly meaningful way so it goes without saying common sense approach needed address this pressing issue proactively responsibly ensure safety well being everybody everybody deserves live peace free from fear intimidation regardless race gender religion creed color national origin sexual orientation political affiliation socioeconomic status educational attainment geographical location etcetera alike because we all human beings deserving basic fundamental human rights protected guaranteed constitution ensuring equal justice under law equally applied fairly impartial manner respecting inherent dignity worth every individual participant member society collective whole entirety irrespective differences whatever nature kind imaginable okay let me stop here take breath catch my train thought continue later another day perhaps when more information available maybe better equipped handle questions concerns raised thoughtfully constructively productively engaging dialogue rather than simply react emotionally impulsively without thinking things through carefully considering long term consequences actions decisions made collectively together collaboratively working towards common goal shared vision safe prosperous future generations come next generation leaders emerge ready tackle challenges ahead courageously wisely compassionately understanding empathetic perspective always putting needs interests frontline priority ensuring sustainability progress harmony balance unity strength resilience hope optimism prevail triumph over adversity overcome obstacles barriers standing together united indivisible strong proud inclusive diverse vibrant thriving communities flourishing societies worldwide win win scenarios benefiting everybody absolutely nobody left behind forgotten ignored marginalized disenfranchised oppressed disadvantaged minorities etcetera alike because we all interconnected interdependent coexisting symbiotically reliant mutually supportive one another succeed grow prosper simultaneously elevating human consciousness spirit collective evolution advancing civilization progress positivity peace love light shining bright illuminating pathways ahead brighter future await us embracing change adaptably courageously stepping boldly forward confident assertiveness empowered voices heard loud clear resonating deeply touch hearts minds inspiring action positive transformation growth evolutionary leaps boundless possibilities await those willing brave enough step up lead way pave pathway paradise earth heaven freedom equality justice liberty happiness fulfillment dreams aspirations materializing manifest destiny rising tides lifting boats anchorages uplifting'}}, 'id': 'qVaJ6829Js', 'forum': 'kq166jACVP', 'replyto': 'u8ZIOHZ2zi', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/Authors'], 'number': 15, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723040931693, 'cdate': 1723040931693, 'tmdate': 1730889793526, 'mdate': 1730889793526, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': ""The author's detailed response [2/5]""}, 'comment': {'value': '> **(Question #1)** Apart from safety tasks, how would the aligner model perform in other tasks, such as math or coding?\n\n**Re:** Thank you very much for your suggestions.

I am quite interested in how a trained Aligner performs on OOD datasets.\n\n**Re:** \nThank you very much for your suggestion. Regarding `I am quite interested in how a trained Aligner performs on OOD datasets`, we conducted the following experiments: without additional proportional datasets, we connected the trained Aligner to different pre-trained models and tested it on `HumanEval`, `MMLU`, `MATH`, and `MT-Bench`. We found that Aligner performed well on OOD datasets due to its dual Copy and Correction capabilities. Upon examining the data cases, we identified two main reasons for this performance:\n\n- The base model used to train Aligner is the Llama2-XB-Base, which possesses general capabilities. Through the Q-A-C learning process, the base model with general capabilities can learn the more easily generalizable representations from the preference dataset, which are the ""corrective differences between good and bad answers,"" compared to RLHF\'s reward model that directly scores Q-A.\n- The dual Copy-Correction capability allows Aligner to be more conservative in some OOD Q-A cases, thereby leaning towards executing the Copy operation.\nWe will include a detailed description of these findings in the revised version.\n\n**Table 1.

In your initial comments, you highlighted concerns regarding Aligner's experiments in the OOD setting and anomalies in the data points in Table 1. To address these concerns, we conducted additional experiments during the rebuttal period without extra training. We **evaluated the trained Aligner on zero-shot generalization experiments on `HumanEval`, `MMLU`, `MATH`, and `MT-Bench`**. We also re-examined the original dataset for the anomalies in Table 1 and performed re-sampling. To further validate the effectiveness and robustness of our experiments, **we included additional experiments using Llama3 and Llama3.1 as the upstream models**, aiming to alleviate any remaining concerns you might have. We sincerely hope for your continued support for Aligner. If you have any further concerns, please feel free to contact us. Specifically, we have added the following discussions:\n- Without additional training, we provided Aligner's experimental data on the four evaluation datasets: `HumanEval`, `MMLU`, `MATH`, and `MT-Bench`, as validation experiments from the OOD generalization perspective.\n- Included experiments using Llama3 and Llama3.1 as base models, providing effective evidence of Aligner's outstanding performance.\n- Extended the experimental results of Aligner on non-corrected datasets by conducting comparative experiments on publicly available datasets such as PKU-SafeRLHF, HH-RLHF, and UltraFeedback. These results indicate that Aligner significantly outperforms existing methods even when trained on preference datasets.\n- Explained the anomalies in the data points in Table 1, primarily due to the excessively long output from Llama2-70-Chat during dynamic sampling.\n- Included experiments comparing Aligner with CAI and Self-improvement, expanding the content of Table 3 in the original paper.\n- Added consistency comparison experiments between GPT-4 evaluations and human evaluations to eliminate the influence of corrected response length.\n- Analyzed the response lengths before and after Aligner corrections to eliminate the influence of corrected response length.\n- Added experiments for BoN with N=5 and N=10, as well as BeamSearch.\n- Investigated evidence from existing open-source technical reports of models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA2, highlighting that RLHF cannot effectively balance helpfulness and harmlessness.\n\n\n-------\n\n\n**Here are our detailed responses to each of your questions and suggestions.

For advanced language models such as GPT-4, do we need the aligner to help with the alignment?\n\n**Re:**\nThank you for your valuable feedback and question. Despite the strong instruction-following capabilities of LLMs like GPT-4, which can self-critique and correct their responses, the Aligner still holds irreplaceable advantages, primarily in the following three aspects:\n\n- The model's self-criticism and correction capabilities require users to use specific prompts, such as `Your answer is problematic, please reconsider.` This not only demands users to judge the correctness of the answers but also requires them to use additional prompts to activate GPT-4's self-correction function. This occupies the model's valuable context length, and expanding the context is highly resource-intensive for large models like GPT-4.\n- Although GPT-4 is powerful, it still has knowledge blind spots. For instance, it once couldn't answer a simple question like `Which is larger, 9.11 or 9.9?`. **The Aligner can function as a patch for such large models.** \nSimilar to how the Windows system doesn’t update to a major version every time an issue arises but instead uses patches to fix problems and only upgrades to a major version after accumulating enough fixes. The combination of Aligner and GPT-4 works in a similar way. When GPT-4 encounters issues, the Aligner can be used as a patch to perform targeted corrections. After accumulating enough error cases, the model parameters can then be fine-tuned. Given GPT-4's massive number of parameters, frequent fine-tuning to address various bad cases is impractical.\n- GPT-4 excels in general capabilities, but in specific fields, such as rare diseases in clinical cardiology, it often provides incorrect answers. This type of knowledge is very scarce in the model’s pre-training data, leading to weaker performance in these rare scenarios. Adding a specialized knowledge enhancer like the Aligner on top of GPT-4 aligns well with practical application needs.\n- GPT-4 is particularly conservative in providing safe answers. For example, when asked about chemical reagents, even if the user considers it a normal inquiry, as a general-purpose model serving different regions and countries, GPT-4 tends to provide conservative responses. When deploying such powerful models in specific regions, adding an Aligner to improve user experience is very necessary.\n\nExperimentally, the Aligner demonstrates significant performance advantages over self-correct methods like CAI, as shown in the Table 2. \n\n**More importantly, Self-correct and Aligner are not mutually exclusive**. On the contrary, the combination of both can achieve a synergistic effect greater than the sum of their parts. The former ensures that the preliminary model produces better responses, while the latter fills in the gaps in the model's answers. Based on your suggestions, we will include relevant discussions and experiments in the revised version.\n\n**Table 2.

Firstly, we would like to emphasize that **Aligner does not rely on correction datasets; it achieves effective alignment using publicly available preference datasets.** In the paper's Table 3, we utilized open-source preference feedback datasets such as `PKU-SafeRLHF` and `HH-RLHF`. These datasets only require annotators to judge which candidate answer is better. By training the Aligner on such non-corrective human preference datasets, we compared its performance with `SFT`, `RLHF`, and `DPO`, demonstrating a clear advantage.\n\nTo enhance the persuasiveness of our experiments, we added an additional preference feedback dataset, `UltraFeedback`, during the rebuttal period. The overall experimental results are as follows:\n\n**Table 1.

For instance, Aligner can generate corrected responses, A*, from an initial model's response, A. These corrected responses can serve as synthetic preference datasets to facilitate multiple iterations of RLHF, eliminating the need for additional manual annotations.""}}, 'id': 'UdTzYZonSD', 'forum': 'kq166jACVP', 'replyto': 'OOSP1XTWnI', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/Authors'], 'number': 9, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723037261449, 'cdate': 1723037261449, 'tmdate': 1730889793875, 'mdate': 1730889793875, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': 'Official Reply to Reviewer 7osp'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Dear Reviewer 7osp: \n\nThank you very much for your time and valuable feedback on the Aligner review.

RLHF generates different responses through shared prompts and employs human annotators or AI to label these responses, such as response-A > response-B, and based on this preference data, trains a reward model (RM). However, considering that evaluating the helpfulness and harmlessness of a response involves a multi-dimensional comprehensive assessment, trade-offs need to be made across different metrics. RLHF/DPO **compresses these comprehensive metrics into a single preference annotation**. Some responses may focus more on the helpfulness of the information, while others may emphasize the harmlessness of the response, making it challenging for RLHF\'s RM to score across multiple objectives [1][2][3]. On the other hand, Aligner learns the correction residual between generally bad and good responses. Compared to binary preference comparison, Aligner can achieve a comprehensive improvement across both dimensions.\n\n[1] Llama2 in Section 3.2.2 emphasizes:\n> Others have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it challenging for a single reward model to perform well on both.\n> (Bai et al., 2022a) 为 Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\n\n[2] Safe RLHF: Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback emphasizes:\n> In RLHF phase: However, the pursuit of increasing helpfulness and harmlessness may often contradict in practice.\n\n[3] In Section 6 ""Risks & Mitigations; Model-Assisted Safety Pipeline"" of the GPT-4 technical report, it emphasizes:\n> As with prior GPT models, we fine-tune the model’s behavior using\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to produce responses better aligned with the user’s intent. However, after RLHF, our models can still be brittle on unsafe inputs as well as sometimes exhibit undesired behaviors on both safe and unsafe inputs. These undesired behaviors can arise when instructions to labelers were underspecified during reward model data collection portion of the RLHF pipeline.'}}, 'id': '4X6NybJBpk', 'forum': 'kq166jACVP', 'replyto': '50koUmgA9H', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/Authors'], 'number': 7, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723036942141, 'cdate': 1723036942141, 'tmdate': 1730889793995, 'mdate': 1730889793995, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': ""The author's detailed response [5/6]""}, 'comment': {'value': '**Table 6.

We tested the trained Aligner on different upstream models and evaluated its performance on `HumanEval`, `MMLU`, `MATH`, and `MT-Bench`. This showcases the Aligner's OOD zero-shot generalization capability. We found that due to the Aligner's combined properties of `Copy` and `Correction`, it performed well on OOD datasets. Upon examining the data cases, we identified two reasons for this:\n- The base model used for training the Aligner is the llama2-7B-Base, which inherently possesses general capabilities. Through Q-A-C learning, this base model can acquire representations from the preference dataset that are easier to generalize, specifically focusing on the `corrective differences between good and bad responses` compared to the direct scoring of Q-A by RLHF reward models.\n- The combined Copy-Correction ability allows the Aligner to be conservative in some OOD Q-A scenarios, thereby leaning towards executing Copy operations.""}}, 'id': 'coTI8aypb3', 'forum': 'kq166jACVP', 'replyto': 'm5kTQMgzxn', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/Authors'], 'number': 3, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16191/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723036773515, 'cdate': 1723036773515, 'tmdate': 1730889794248, 'mdate': 1730889794248, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': ""The author's detailed response [1/6]""}, 'comment': {'value': ""> **(Weakness #1)** The training of Aligner requires a robust Teacher model and human annotations.

The core difference between `Aligner` and `self-improvment` **lies in how they achieve better responses based on the original model's answers**. Numerous works, such as CAI [2], have demonstrated that models possess the capability to self-improve. Self-improvement relies on human experts designing some Chain of Thought (CoT) examples to enable the model to perform multiple-path decoding and vote for the best response [1]. However, these methods still encounter the following issues:\n\n- In cases where the model's original answers are poor or lack knowledge, self-improvement struggles to produce a better answer through CoT+vote. In contrast, **Aligner can inject the missing knowledge from the upstream model using an additional preference dataset**, thereby achieving improvements without relying on the model's self-correcting ability. As shown in the Table 1, Aligner demonstrates superior performance in the comprehensive enhancement of helpfulness and harmlessness compared to self-improvement.\n- Designing CoT to meet various rules and constraints for different scenarios requires a high level of expertise from human experts and strong instruction-following capabilities from the model. **This is challenging for smaller or weaker models (as shown in the table below, models like Beaver-7B show limited improvement)**. Aligner, on the other hand, can be trained solely on a human preference dataset, where identifying the better and worse responses is less demanding than designing expert responses.\n\n**Table 1. The performance comparison (Win Rate) between Aligner and self-improvement methods.**\n|      Model $\\downarrow$ Method $\\rightarrow$      | **w/** CAI    | **w/** self-improve | **w/** Aligner-7B |\n|:---------------:|:--------:|:---------------:|:------------:|\n|      Metric $\\rightarrow$       | Helpful | Helpful        | Helpful     |\n|      GPT-4      | +14.83% | +20.93%        | **+22.16%**     |\n|    Alpaca2-7B   | +22.04% | +22.22%        | **+47.71%**    |\n|    Beaver-7B    | +6.35%  | +0.6%          | **+12.2%**      |\n| Llama2-13B-Chat | +13.45% | +13.05%        | **+18.63%**     |\n\n**More importantly, Self-improvement and Aligner are not mutually exclusive**. On the contrary, the combination of both can achieve a synergistic effect greater than the sum of their parts. The former ensures that the preliminary model produces better responses, while the latter fills in the gaps in the model's answers. Based on your suggestions, we will include relevant discussions and experiments in the revised version.\n\n[1] Large Language Models Can Self-Improve\n[2] Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\n\nBased on the currently available technical reports [3], whether it’s RLHF or Aligner, methods that leverage learning from robust teacher models and human annotations can effectively incorporate human feedback into model fine-tuning, aligning the model's behavior with human intentions. In the current applications of LLMs fine-tuning and alignment, introducing human feedback or AI feedback remains an effective means of enhancing performance.\n\nAligner, in comparison to RLHF, exhibits significant advantages. **Even a model as small as Aligner-2B can effectively enhance GPT-4's performance due to one key insight: it is easier for a model to learn the differences between good and bad responses than to generate good responses directly**. As you pointed out, \n>Aligner is imbued with the concept of Residual Correction, reminiscent of ResNet.\n\nThis concept is similar to residual learning, and our ablation experiments and interpretability analysis further demonstrate the residual characteristics of Aligner. Moreover, Aligner does not rely on a specialized correction dataset. Using publicly available preference datasets, Aligner can achieve better alignment effects compared to RLHF/DPO.

However, existing FL frameworks suffer from efficacy deterioration due to the system heterogeneity inherent in edge computing, especially in the presence of domain shifts across local data. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous FL framework DapperFL, to enhance model performance across multiple domains. In DapperFL, we introduce a dedicated Model Fusion Pruning (MFP) module to produce personalized compact local models for clients to address the system heterogeneity challenges. The MFP module prunes local models with fused knowledge obtained from both local and remaining domains, ensuring robustness to domain shifts. Additionally, we design a Domain Adaptive Regularization (DAR) module to further improve the overall performance of DapperFL. The DAR module employs regularization generated by the pruned model, aiming to learn robust representations across domains. Furthermore, we introduce a specific aggregation algorithm for aggregating heterogeneous local models with tailored architectures and weights. We implement DapperFL on a real-world FL platform with heterogeneous clients. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with multiple domains demonstrate that DapperFL outperforms several state-of-the-art FL frameworks by up to 2.28%, while significantly achieving model volume reductions ranging from 20% to 80%.

Below we address your concerns in order.\n\n\n## Response to Weakness 1:\n\n**Clarification on System Heterogeneity:**\nIn our paper, we emphasize that low-capability clients ""fail to complete"" local training rather than being ""unable to perform"" local training. Following the conventional setting [1,2,3], low-capability clients (i.e., stragglers) possess the basic capability to train models. However, they fail to complete training within the maximum allowed time due to limited resources, such as battery status or CPU power. MFP addresses this issue by reducing resource consumption, thereby enabling the stragglers to participate in FL.\n\n**Clarification on Domain Shifts Example:**\nImages collected by the cameras are not exclusively ""multi-view"" data, particularly when factors such as lighting conditions or weather vary which are classified as domain shifts. Additionally, images with different view angles only (i.e., ""multi-view"") are also multi-domain data. For instance, previous work [4] has utilized rotated images to create multi-domain datasets.\n\n**Application Scenarios and Illustration:**\nThank you for your insightful comments. Due to the length limitations, please refer to **Responses to Weakness 3 \\& Question 2** from **Reviewer Ct3S** for the details.\n\n>[1] Lim, Wei Yang Bryan, et al.

NIPS 2022.\n\n\n## Response to Weakness 2 \\& Question 1 \\& Question 2:\n\n**Innovative and Practical Differences of MFP:**\nAs detailed in lines 143-160, Algorithm 1, and Fig. 1, a dynamic model fusion mechanism is proposed within MFP. This mechanism is distinct from regular FL. Inspired by transfer learning, DapperFL incorporates the global model into the fine-tuned model to assimilate cross-domain knowledge (formally represented in Eq. 1). Furthermore, a dynamic adjustment mechanism controls the quality of transferred knowledge (as described in Eq. 2), preventing overfitting to the local domain and improving the model\'s generality. \nOur experiments in the presence of domain shifts show that DapperFL with MFP improves accuracy by up to 7.45\\% (on the Digits benchmark) compared to SOTA frameworks that support system heterogeneity.\n\n**Clarification on Additional Computations and Global Model Deployment:**\nIt is important to note that MFP does **NOT** entail additional computations. MFP requires clients to fine-tune the model during the initial epoch, consuming resources comparable to regular FL. In subsequent epochs, the pruned model undergoes updates, significantly reducing resource consumption (up to 80\\%). Moreover, fine-tuning the global model for at least one epoch is essential in popular FL methods to capture data features, and this is not unique to ours.\n\n**Clarification on Pruning Strategy:** \nWe would like to highlight that, the pruning strategy used in DapperFL is structural pruning (channel pruning), rather than unstructural pruning. \nChannel pruning is hardware-friendly and can be easily implemented with popular ML libraries such as PyTorch, making it suitable for edge devices. \nWe provide our code in the Abstract, which details the implementation of our approach.\nWe want to emphasize that ""unstructured pruning"" is not presented in our paper. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the importance of clarity and will include a description of the adopted structural pruning.\n\n\n## Response to Weakness 3:\n\nWe appreciate your constructive suggestion. Specifically, the global model transitions to $\\mathcal{W}^t$, the fine-tuned model transitions to $\\boldsymbol{w}^{t,i}\\_{ft}$, and the fused model transitions to $\\boldsymbol{w}\\_{fs}^{t,i}$.\n\n\n## Response to Weakness 4:\n\nThank you for highlighting these studies that offer valuable insights into heterogeneous FL and model pruning. We will incorporate them into our paper to discuss their relationship to ours.\nDespite the similarities, our work contributes novel solutions by focusing on domain shifts and the integration of MFP, DAR, and heterogeneous aggregation. \n\n\n## Response to Weakness 5:\n\nThank you for highlighting these important works.\nWe did not include distillation-related work as they typically require maintaining both a teacher model and a student model. This imposes a significant burden and is impractical in our targeted scenarios. \nNonetheless, we acknowledge the relevance of them and will incorporate them to enrich our literature review.\n\n\n## Response to Limitation 1:\n\n**Hyper-Parameter Selection:**\nPlease refer to **Responses to Weakness 1 & Questions 1** from **Reviewer 1ipw** for the details.\n\n**Solution for System Heterogeneity:**\nPlease refer to **Response to Weakness 2 \\& Question 1 \\& Question 2** for the details.\n\n**Theoretical Convergence Analysis:**\nIt is noteworthy that extensive prior work has established the convergence of model pruning-based FL [5,6,7,8]. Our DapperFL, which also incorporates model pruning, does not violate the convergence of FL. The experimental results in our paper further support the convergence of DapperFL.\n\n>[5] Zhou, Hanhan, et al.

Below we address your concerns in order.\n\n\n## Response to Weakness 1:\n\nWe would like to emphasize that, our proposed framework is **NOT** a combination of existing approaches. \nWhile our work builds on established concepts, it introduces novel components and methods that address significant gaps in the current literature, particularly concerning domain shifts in resource-constrained edge environments. \nWe outline the substantial differences and innovative contributions of our DapperFL framework from existing works as follows: \n\n1) **Transfer Learning-Inspired Model Fusion Pruning.**\nExisting heterogeneous FL frameworks, such as [1,2,3], focus on addressing data heterogeneity (e.g., variations in sample and label distributions) but do not directly tackle the challenge of domain shifts, which can significantly impact the performance of pruned models. \nOur work introduces Model Fusion Pruning (MFP), which not only accounts for data heterogeneity but also addresses domain shifts. MFP dynamically combines local domain information with cross-domain information to prune local models effectively, enhancing their performance under domain shift conditions.\n\n2) **Lightweight Solutions for Domain Shifts.**\nCurrent methods often require extensive data collection transmission to handle domain shifts, which is impractical in resource-constrained environments. \nOur DapperFL framework, however, offers a novel resource-efficient approach to handling domain shifts through the MFP and Domain Adaptive Regularization (DAR) modules. The MFP module prunes local models leveraging local and cross-domain information. The DAR module introduces a regularization term that encourages the generation of domain-invariant representations at the local level, eliminating the need for transmitting domain-invariant representations, which is commonly required in existing studies. \n\n3) **Specific Model Aggregation in Cross-Domain Environments.**\nExisting works, including [3], lack mechanisms to ensure that domain-specific features are retained in heterogeneous environments.\nIn contrast, we propose a novel model recovery mechanism during heterogeneous model aggregation. This mechanism ensures the preservation of specific domain knowledge while transferring global knowledge, as detailed in Eq.6 of our original paper. This unique operation reinstates the pruned model's architecture and incorporates global knowledge, differentiating our approach from existing methods.\n\n>[1] Jiang, Z., et al.

Hermes: an efficient federated learning framework for heterogeneous mobile clients. MobiCom 2021.\n\n\n## Response to Weakness 2 \\& Question 1:\n\nWe follow a conventional setting commonly used in representation learning research to segment the model. Specifically, all layers except the final linear layer act as the encoder, while the last linear layer of the model acts as the predictor. \nWe acknowledge the importance of clarity and will include a detailed description of this segmentation process.\n\n\n## Response to Weakness 3 \\& Question 2:\n\nConsider a mobile voice assistant like Apple Siri, which requires an efficient FL framework to collect and analyze user voice data [4]. Users may interact with Siri using different accents even when speaking the same language. This variation leads to domain shift problems, as the system must adapt to different speech patterns. Additionally, the diversity in mobile phone capabilities introduces system heterogeneity, as devices with varying processing powers may affect the performance of local computations. Another pertinent example is the IoV network, where smart vehicles collect, compute and communicate data for tasks like navigation and traffic management [3,5]. The data collected, such as images, can vary significantly in quality due to factors like motion blur, leading to multi-domain datasets. On the other hand, the varying computing power and network conditions of vehicles create system heterogeneity challenges [5]. Beyond these scenarios, our framework is relevant to various scenarios such as smart homes and smart health systems [1,2].\n\nWe have added Fig. 1 to the rebuttal PDF to visually demonstrate the impact of these issues on FL performance. Specifically: \n1) **System Heterogeneity:** Device 1, with stringent resource constraints, fails to complete its model update within the maximum allowed time. As a result, the central server excludes it from the FL process and misses out on the data features captured by Device 1. \n2) **Domain Shifts:** Devices 2 and 3 collect data from different domains, leading to diverse local models. With non-IID data, the global model aggregation may become biased, particularly if Device 3 contributes more data, thus potentially limiting the benefit for Device 2.\n \n>[1] Lim, Wei Yang Bryan, et al.

Below we address your concerns in order.\n\n## Response to Weakness 1:\nWe utilize one epoch of local training to determine the pruned models for the following reasons: \n\n1) Additional local epochs do not significantly enhance the model's performance, which justifies the use of a single epoch for efficiency. As noted in [1], experiments have demonstrated that extending local training beyond one epoch yields results comparable to those achieved with just one epoch.\n\n2) In previous domain generalization-related FL research, such as [1], one epoch is also employed to collect local domain information. This method has proven adequate for capturing essential features and domain characteristics.\n\n3) Pioneering research in model design and neural architecture search, such as in [2], has demonstrated that a few epochs are sufficient to obtain a coarse estimate of a sub-model. This approach is effective in quickly assessing model configurations without extensive computation. \n\n\n>[1] Zhang, Jianqing, et al.

Additionally, we have included more default values for the hyper-parameters in the comparison frameworks in the rebuttal PDF file, which will be incorporated into our final version. Specifically, the default values are $\\alpha^{L2R}=0.01$ in FedSR, $\\alpha^{CMI}=0.001$ in FedSR, and $\\tau=0.02$ in FPL. These values are consistent with those used in the original implementations of these frameworks, ensuring accuracy and reliability in our comparisons.\n\n## Response to Weakness 3:\nThank you for your meticulous observation. To avoid confusion and ensure clarity, we will change the notation for client-level subscripts in the experiments section to $l$. We hope this adjustment will improve the readability and precision of our paper.\n\n## Response to Weakness 4:\nWe acknowledge that further elaboration on the limitations of this work could provide the reader with a fuller understanding. As an example, the limitations of hyper-parameter selection will be described below:\n\n“Despite DapperFL shows promise in addressing system heterogeneity and domain shifts, it also introduces four hyper-parameters: $\\alpha_0$, $\\alpha_{min}$, $\\epsilon$, and $\\gamma$. These hyper-parameters influence the domain generalization performance of the global model. One limitation is the manual tuning required for these hyper-parameters, which may be time-consuming and require domain-specific expertise. As such, a potential future direction is the development of an automatic selection mechanism for these hyper-parameters. This enhancement would not only improve the flexibility of DapperFL but also make it more accessible to users without extensive knowledge in hyper-parameter tuning, thereby broadening the applicability and ease of deployment of our framework.”\n\n## Response to Question 1:\nWe opted for the $\\ell_1$ norm instead of the $\\ell_2$ norm for the following reasons: The $\\ell_1$ norm requires fewer computational resources, making it more suitable for our framework, which targets resource-constrained edge devices. \nAdditionally, as shown by pioneering work [3], there is no significant difference in the effectiveness of using $\\ell_1$ norm versus $\\ell_2$ norm for calculating mask matrices in the context of model pruning. This finding supports our choice, as the $\\ell_1$ norm offers a more resource-efficient alternative without compromising the quality of the pruning process.\n\n>[3] Li, Hao, et al. Pruning Filters for Efficient ConvNets. ICLR 2022.\n\n## Response to Question 2:\nIn our proposed framework, the heterogeneous models are transmitted to the server along with the mask matrices. These mask matrices indicate the architecture of the heterogeneous models. \nSpecifically, the mask matrices encode the structure of each model by highlighting which parts of the model are retained and which are pruned. \nThis information allows the central server to understand and manage the varying architectures of the heterogeneous models during aggregation.""}}, 'id': 'dvRDoYbUzv', 'forum': 'Pezt0xttae', 'replyto': 'df0lPebR9t', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9280/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9280/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9280/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722955282800, 'cdate': 1722955282800, 'tmdate': 1730882135429, 'mdate': 1730882135429, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""We sincerely thank you for your constructive and helpful comments. Below we address your concerns in order.\n\n## Response to Weakness 1 \\& Question 1:\nThanks for your suggestion to provide default values or an automatic selection mechanism for hyper-parameters. We acknowledge that hyper-parameter selection is indeed crucial, especially for practitioners looking to effectively apply the DapperFL framework. \n\nIn DapperFL, $\\alpha \\in [\\alpha_{min}, \\alpha_0]$ control the balance between local and global information, which can impact how well the model generalizes across different domains. The sensitivity factor $\\epsilon$ determines the rate at which $\\alpha$ decreases from $\\alpha_0$ to $\\alpha_{min}$, while $\\gamma$ influences the regularization strength.\nIn our paper, we have conducted ablation experiments (in Section 4.3) to identify suitable hyper-parameter settings. The experimental results suggest that: \n1) Increasing $\\alpha_0$ or decreasing $\\alpha_{min}$ generally enhances the incorporation of global knowledge, improving generalization. In our experiments, setting $\\alpha_0$ to 0.9 and $\\alpha_{min}$ to 0.1 resulted in good model accuracy.\n2) As $\\epsilon$ increases, model accuracy suffers from a decrease due to insufficient guidance from the global knowledge except for $\\epsilon$ is less than 0.2. \n3) $\\gamma$ helps regularize the model and prevent overfitting. In our experiments, setting it to an optimal value of 0.01 can balance model personalization on the local domain and generalization across multiple domains.\n\nFurthermore, recognizing the abnormal relationship between model accuracy and hyper-parameter $\\epsilon$ as it is less than 0.2, we implement Bayesian search as an automatic selection mechanism to find a better $\\epsilon$. Due to limited rebuttal time and hardware constraints, we have tried our best to include as many single runs as possible to search for a better $\\epsilon$ for DapperFL. Specifically, we run DapperFL on the Office Caltech benchmark 40 times, adopting a distinct $\\epsilon$ of less than 0.2 each time. The values are selected using the Bayesian search algorithm. The results are presented in Fig. 2 of the rebuttal PDF file. As illustrated, the Bayesian search-based automatic selection mechanism indicates that model accuracy is likely to reach a higher level when $\\epsilon$ approaches 0.2, aligning with our original paper's default setting of $\\epsilon=0.2$.\n\n\n## Response to Weakness 2 \\& Question 2:\nThe relationship between model accuracy and model footprint is complex and not necessarily linear, as evidenced by previous studies [1, 2]. In our work, we employ the MFP module within DapperFL, which addresses the over-fitting issues that can arise from the over-parameterization of neural networks. This module not only reduces the model footprint but also enhances the model's generalization capabilities, leading to more robust performance across diverse domains. Additionally, the DAR module is incorporated to further improve model accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving distributed clients with domain shifts.\n\n> [1] Z. Liu, et al.

Efficient deep structure learning for resource-limited IoT devices, GLOBECOM 2020.\n\n\n## Response to Weakness 3:\nOne primary objective of DapperFL is to optimize a robust global model with strong domain generalization capabilities across distributed local data. In the test or production phase, this optimized global model can be deployed on new devices, ensuring good performance across different environments. Additionally, newly introduced devices can also participate in the DapperFL framework. They can contribute to the continual improvement of the global model by optimizing a local model based on their own local data, which is then aggregated to update the global model. This approach not only enhances the global model's adaptability to new data distributions but also leverages the unique data available on new devices to improve overall model robustness.\n\n\n## Response to Weakness 4:\nThank you for highlighting these relevant studies. These studies offer valuable insights into heterogeneous FL and model pruning on devices, aligning well with the themes of our research. We will incorporate these references into our paper to discuss their relationship to our study, highlighting similarities, differences, and how our work extends or diverges from these existing approaches.\n\n\n## Response to Question 3:\nIn our work, “local knowledge” refers to the feature extraction capabilities of the local model, which are derived from the specific data available in its local domain. This knowledge encapsulates the nuances and characteristics of the data that the local model has been trained on. \nOn the other hand, “global knowledge” represents the aggregated feature extraction capabilities of the global model, which are informed by data across all participating domains. The global model synthesizes diverse knowledge from different local models to provide a more generalized understanding that is applicable across multiple domains. By combining these two forms of knowledge, we aim to leverage both the specialized insights of local models and the generalized capabilities of the global model, thereby enhancing the performance and adaptability of DapperFL.""}}, 'id': 'ORzresNzgy', 'forum': 'Pezt0xttae', 'replyto': 'JdmzySlbvM', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9280/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9280/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9280/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722954418247, 'cdate': 1722954418247, 'tmdate': 1730882135563, 'mdate': 1730882135563, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We sincerely thank the reviewers for their time and appreciate all the detailed reviews and constructive feedback.

However, existing FL frameworks suffer from efficacy deterioration due to the system heterogeneity inherent in edge computing, especially in the presence of domain shifts across local data. \nIn this paper, we propose a heterogeneous FL framework DapperFL, to enhance model performance across multiple domains. In DapperFL, we introduce a dedicated Model Fusion Pruning (MFP) module to produce personalized compact local models for clients to address the system heterogeneity challenges. The MFP module prunes local models with fused knowledge obtained from both local and remaining domains, ensuring robustness to domain shifts. Additionally, we design a Domain Adaptive Regularization (DAR) module to further improve the overall performance of DapperFL. The DAR module employs regularization generated by the pruned model, aiming to learn robust representations across domains. Furthermore, we introduce a specific aggregation algorithm for aggregating heterogeneous local models with tailored architectures and weights. We implement DapperFL on a real-world FL platform with heterogeneous clients. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with multiple domains demonstrate that DapperFL outperforms several state-of-the-art FL frameworks by up to 2.28%, while significantly achieving model volume reductions ranging from 20% to 80%.

Place cells in the hippocampus, named for their explicit encoding of position, are believed to be a neural substrate of these maps, with place cell ""remapping"" explaining how this system can represent different contexts. Briefly, place cells alter their firing properties, or ""remap"", in response to changes in experiential or sensory cues. Substantial sensory changes, produced, e.g., by moving between environments, cause large subpopulations of place cells to change their tuning entirely. While many studies have looked at the physiological basis of remapping, we lack explicit calculations of how the contextual capacity of the place cell system changes as a function of place field firing properties. Here, we propose a geometric approach to understanding population level activity of place cells.  Using known firing field statistics, we investigate how changes to place cell firing properties affect the distances between representations of different environments within firing rate space.  Using this approach, we find that the number of contexts storable by the hippocampus grows exponentially with the number of place cells, and calculate this exponent for environments of different sizes. We identify a fundamental trade-off between high resolution encoding of position and the number of storable contexts. This trade-off is tuned by place cell width, which might explain the change in firing field scale along the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus. We demonstrate that clustering of place cells near likely points of confusion, such as boundaries, increases the contextual capacity of the place system within our framework and conclude by discussing how our geometric approach could be extended to include other cell types and abstract spaces.",Oral Session 1A: Neuroscience and Intepretability,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=REIK4SZMJt,https://openreview.net/forum?id=REIK4SZMJt,REIK4SZMJt,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'This paper develops a theory for understanding the tradeoffs between encoding space and encoding context in the hippocampus.

We thank the reviewer for pointing this out! In fact the ventral cells have wider tuning then the dorsal cells, and we will fix this typo in the final paper, and include citations to the Kjelstrup et al. and the Komorowski et al papers.  Note that our predictions are based more on the relative firing field sizes of place cells, and not on where these cells are located, so the key results of our paper remain unchanged. In particular, we predict that cells with wider tunings are better tuned for contextual separation but are worse at fine tuned spatial tasks, while those with narrower tunings are better tuned for tasks associated with fine-grained memory, but worse at contextual separation (though both are still able to contribute to both tasks). Correcting our dorso-ventral typo, our suggestions about experiments involving the dorsal hippocampus should be replaced with experiments involving the ventral hippocampus, and vice-versa. In particular, as the ventral cells are those with wider tuning, the corrected prediction is that selective inhibition of ventral cells should lead to worse contextual performance. Conversely, the fact that the more dorsal cells have narrower tuning suggests that selective inhibition of the dorsal hippocampus should lead to worse performance in fine grained memory tasks under our model. After this correction, our model is in line with the experimental papers you mention. In particular, our theory is supported by the result that lesions of the dorsal hippocampus impair spatial tasks (Moser et. al. 1995, Hock and Bunsey 1998) while lesions of the ventral hippocampus do not meaningfully affect performance on spatial tasks, and we will cite these experiments in the final paper. Likewise, the fact that conditioned contextual fear responses, like those described in Richmond et. al. (1999) and Bannerman et. al. (2003), are impaired after ventral lesions also supports our hypothesis that the more widely tuned neurons are better for context separation. \n\nAs for the predictions involving clustering near boundaries, we will likewise cite the relevant experimental work in the final paper. In particular, the increased incidence of place cells near boundaries in Wiener et al. (1989) is in line with the predictions made by our model. As for noise variability experiments, one could inject white noise into hippocampal neurons through electrical input, or pharmacologically increase firing variability, which under our model should reduce both spatial and contextual specificity. In particular, there is a noise threshold above which the ability to separate context disappears in our geometric model. However our condition for contextual separability is likely stricter than one implemented by the hippocampus of a realistic animal, so contextual separation should persist to some extent past this noise threshold – i.e., we expect the threshold to be more of a smooth crossover than a sharp transition. \n\nFinally we will address the minor edits suggested by the reviewer.'}}, 'id': 'WJOwe8IcBn', 'forum': 'REIK4SZMJt', 'replyto': 'hBlRndqMxn', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19094/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19094/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19094/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722956311565, 'cdate': 1722956311565, 'tmdate': 1730884079605, 'mdate': 1730884079605, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We appreciate the time taken by the reviewer to review our submission, and the suggestions provided.\n\nWe believe that our submission is relevant to the NeurIPS community, and in particular, to the neural coding section of the Neuroscience topic, which is listed in the call for submissions. As contextual discriminability and spatial memory are both implicated by hippocampal function, approaching both through the geometry of the underlying hippocampal codes will be of interest to this community. Although the work presented here does not directly touch on the applications or theory of artificial networks, we believe that a better understanding of biological neural networks will lead to a better understanding of artificial networks, and give insights into how to design them for certain tasks. For instance, research at DeepMind (Banino et. al, 2018, Nature), by Cueva and Wei (ICLR 2018)  and by Sorscher et al (NeurIPS 2019) has found that grid-like representations, similar to those found in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex, emerge naturally for networks trained on spatial navigation, leading to deep learning agents with mammal-like navigational abilities. Likewise, place cells in the hippocampus are implicated in general short term memory (Benna and Fusi, 2020, PNAS). So a better theoretical understanding of hippocampal function will be of interest to the wider NeurIPS community when it comes to designing networks capable of flexible memory storage and retrieval.\n\t\nThe reviewer asked if we could have used alternate criteria for separation of neural manifolds. Indeed, there are some options. For example, the work of SueYeon Chung involves a linear separation criterion for perceptual manifolds in deep neural networks (Chung et. al., 2018 APS, Chung et. al, 2020, Nature Communications). Pursuing a simpler separability criteria between activity manifolds, like the linear separation of point-cloud manifolds used in the above work, but in the context of hippocampal coding, is a possible direction we would like to explore in future research.\n\t\nAs for selective inhibition experiments, these are possible via induced lesions to various regions of the hippocampus in rodents.  Lesions in the dorsal region of the hippocampus should lead to impairment on tasks in which high spatial resolution is crucial, such as during maze navigation, while lesions to the ventral hippocampus should lead to greater impairment in contextual tasks. (A typo in our text that inverted dorsal and ventral, but we will correct this in the final version.  Also see comments and responses to reviewer Dte5.) Some of these experiments have already been performed (again see comments to Dte5), and are in agreement with our (typo-corrected) predictions. We will also expand on the possible confusion experiments that could be run to test our hypothesis, and include the relevant citations.

Indeed, we chose to focus our paper on global remapping, with only brief discussion of rate and partial remapping. This is because global remapping has a more dramatic and constraining effect than rate/partial remapping in our analysis: in terms of our manifold picture, partial and rate remapping alter or deform the existing manifolds, while global remapping involves “jumping” from one manifold to another. Global remapping often occurs in situations where context shifts dramatically, which for example can occur when animals move, or are moved, from one environment to another, even if the environments are superficially similar (Leutgeb et. al., 2005 Science, Alme et. al. 2014, PNAS). Partial and rate remapping often occur when an environment is modified, such as via slight changes to wall geometry, introduction of olfactory cues, or movement of cue cards within the same environment (Leutgeb et. al. 2005 Science, Bostock et. al. 1991 Hippocampus, Anderson and Jeffrey, 2003 JNeurosci). In our view, these experiments demonstrate that partial and rate remapping involve a “deformation” of existing memory tasks, while global remapping occurs and is required when completely new memory tasks arise – such as entering a new environment or changing the animal’s goals – so that the animal is required to remember both the current task and the past ones separately, as opposed to slightly modifying the old task. In the context of our manifold picture, partial and rate remapping involve the deformation/refinement of the neural manifolds we are considering, while global remapping involves switching from one manifold to another.  Our results about the capacity for storing context follow from estimating the number of such manifolds that can be packed into the activity space in the presence of noise.  We can account for partial and rate remapping also in our framework by giving each manifold an additional width due to variations in the encoded structures that are not due to neural noise, but rather due to variations that arise from partial remapping. Thus, the qualitative structure of our results will remain unchanged by including the effects of partial remapping. We will discuss this extension in the revised submission – thank you for encouraging us to do so.  Note that, mechanistically, in the context of a network implementation, partial/rate remapping might involve the alteration of some continuous attractor implemented by the hippocampus, while global remapping would involve jumping from one continuous attractor to another.'}}, 'id': '7WIwUKz8sn', 'forum': 'REIK4SZMJt', 'replyto': 'f2f0dftlfx', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19094/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19094/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19094/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722956199431, 'cdate': 1722956199431, 'tmdate': 1730884079616, 'mdate': 1730884079616, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'In this paper, the authors take a geometric approach of analysing context-encoding capacities admitted by place cells population firing.

I do have one major comment pertaining to the model\'s empirical predictions. The paper makes an interesting and testable prediction that the more widely tuned cells in the dorsal hippocampus are specialized for context discrimination, whereas the more narrowly tuned cells in the ventral hippocampus are specialized for fine-grained spatial discrimination. First, I want to point out that this is backwards: ventral cells have wider tuning than dorsal cells. The classic study of this is Kjelstrup et al. (2008, Science), not cited here (see also Komorowski et al., 2013, Journal of Neuroscience). Oddly, the authors cite two papers to support their claim about the dorsal-ventral axis (Lee et al., 2020; Tanni et al., 2022), neither of which actually support this claim. The Lee et al. paper only measures activity in dorsal cells, and it\'s not clear which subregion was measured in the Tanni paper.\n\nThe authors propose selective inhibition experiments to test these predictions. In fact, such experiments have been done, and unfortunately they don\'t consistently support the predictions (none of the studies mentioned below are cited in the paper). The model would make more sense in light of at least some of these studies if the dorsal/ventral division of labor was reversed from what the authors proposed, consistent with the electrophysiology data. The review by Fanselow & Dong (2010, Neuron) provides a more systematic discussion of studies dissociating dorsal and ventral subregions.\n- Richmond et al. (1999, Behavioral Neuroscience) showed that ventral lesions actually *improve* water-maze performance (a classic test of fine-grained spatial memory), whereas dorsal lesions apparently have no effect. Ventral lesions also impaired contextual fear conditioning, but dorsal lesions apparently had no effect except in the test phase where they *increased* conditioned responding to context. See also Bannerman et al. (2003, Behavioural Brain Research) for related results.\n- Hock & Bunsey (1998, Journal of Neuroscience) showed that dorsal, but not ventral, lesions impaired performance on a spatial delayed alternation task, which requires memory of actions in particular spatial locations.\n- On the other hand, Moser et al. (1995, PNAS) showed that dorsal lesions selectively impair spatial memory, whereas ventral lesions do not.\n\nThe authors predict that place cells should cluster near boundaries to support context segregation. No studies are cited to support this prediction, but this is something that has been studied. Consistent with the model prediction, place fields tend to occur near boundaries (e.g., Wiener et al., 1989, Journal of Neuroscience; Hetherington & Shapiro, 1997, Behavioral Neuroscience).\n\nMinor:\n\n- ""hippocampus"" is inconsistently upper-case/lower-case.

Place cells in the hippocampus, named for their explicit encoding of position, are believed to be a neural substrate of these maps, with place cell ""remapping"" explaining how this system can represent different contexts. Briefly, place cells alter their firing properties, or ""remap"", in response to changes in experiential or sensory cues. Substantial sensory changes, produced, e.g., by moving between environments, cause large subpopulations of place cells to change their tuning entirely. While many studies have looked at the physiological basis of remapping, we lack explicit calculations of how the contextual capacity of the place cell system changes as a function of place field firing properties. Here, we propose a geometric approach to understanding population level activity of place cells.  Using known firing field statistics, we investigate how changes to place cell firing properties affect the distances between representations of different environments within firing rate space.  Using this approach, we find that the number of contexts storable by the hippocampus grows exponentially with the number of place cells, and calculate this exponent for environments of different sizes. We identify a fundamental trade-off between high resolution encoding of position and the number of storable contexts. This trade-off is tuned by place cell width, which might explain the change in firing field scale along the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus. We demonstrate that clustering of place cells near likely points of confusion, such as boundaries, increases the contextual capacity of the place system within our framework and conclude by discussing how our geometric approach could be extended to include other cell types and abstract spaces.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'neuroscience_and_cognitive_science'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/3b84d66d0ad7e68594730c3e952459bcaa55fb37.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\nrooke2024trading,\ntitle={Trading Place for Space: Increasing Location Resolution Reduces Contextual Capacity in Hippocampal Codes},\nauthor={Spencer Rooke and Zhaoze Wang and Ronald W Di Tullio and Vijay Balasubramanian},\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=REIK4SZMJt}\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'rooke|trading_place_for_space_increasing_location_resolution_reduces_contextual_capacity_in_hippocampal_codes'}}, 'id': 'REIK4SZMJt', 'forum': 'REIK4SZMJt', 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19094/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19094/Authors'], 'number': 19094, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19094/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19094/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1715789157260, 'cdate': 1715789157260, 'tmdate': 1736561309788, 'mdate': 1736561309788, 'pdate': 1727288201803, 'odate': 1730873993736, 'version': 2}]"

Since the query distributions in round $i$ are independent of the random hypotheses used to answer queries in round $i$, if each of them is a valid response with just constant probability (say $1/e$), then the chance that none of them are a valid response to a fixed query distribution is only $e^{-N} = \\exp(-\\exp(d))$ (recall the hypotheses are chosen randomly). So for a parallel algorithm to ask a query that forces the weak learner to return the true concept, we would need to ask around $t = \\exp(\\exp(d))$ queries.

Such algorithms are modeled by the number of sequential rounds $p$ that they run for, and the amount of work $t$ that can be done in parallel in each round. Each unit of work in a round is typically a query to a weak learning algorithm, that outputs a hypothesis from a class of VC dimension $d$ (and these queries can be instantiated in parallel). Formally, in round $i$, the algorithm invokes (in parallel) the weak learner with distributions $D^i_1,\\dots,D^i_t$, and obtains $h^i_1,\\dots,h^i_t$ such that the error of $h^i_j$ wrt $D^i_j$ is at most $1/2-\\gamma$. There are $p$ such rounds, at the end of which, the weak-to-strong learning algorithm outputs some weighted vote over all the $h^i_j$s obtained so far. Ideally, we want the final classifier output by the algorithm to be *strong*: at the very least, its error should be competitive with that of AdaBoost (which is $\\tilde{O}(d/m\\gamma^2)$ where $m$ is the number of training samples).\n\nUnder a model of weak-to-strong learning defined as above, the classic AdaBoost works with $p=O(\\ln m / \\gamma^2)$, and $t=1$. What are some other reasonable tradeoffs that we can hope for?\n\nKarbasi and Larsen (2024) gave an algorithm that works with $p=1$ and $t=\\exp(O(d \\ln m / \\gamma^2))$. This was followed up on by Lyu et al. (2024), who obtain $p=O(\\ln m/\\gamma^2R)$ and $t=\\exp(O(dR^2))\\ln(1/\\gamma)$ for any $1 \\le R \\le 1/2\\gamma$. Both Karbasi and Larsen (2024) as well as Lyu et al. (2024) also gave some lower bounds, but neither covered the entire spectrum of $p$ and $t$ in terms of tightness with respect to algorithms achieving these bounds.\n\nThis paper largely fills up these gaps. On the upper bound side, the authors present an algorithm that achieves $p=O(\\ln m/\\gamma^2R)$ and $t=\\exp(O(dR)) \\ln \\frac{\\ln m}{\\delta \\gamma^2}$ for any $R \\ge 1$. Observe that the bound on $t$ improves Lyu et al. (2024)\'s bound by a factor $R$ in the exponent. The authors also show lower bounds that are tight (upto log factors) in nearly in all regimes.\n\nBoth, the algorithm for the upper bound, and the lower bound instance, are inspired by the work of Lyu et al. (2024). \n\n### **Upper bound**\n\nThere are $p$ sequential rounds. For simplicity, we describe the first round, prior to which $D_1$ is set to the uniform distribution on the training sample. We break our computation into $R$ chunks in parallel. Each chunk, invokes a weak learner $t/R$ times in parallel on a fresh sample drawn from $D_{1}$, to obtain $t/R$ many hypotheses in total (Thus, the total number of invokations to the weak learner across all the $R$ chunks is $R \\cdot t/R = t$ as required.) \n\nThereafter, there are $R$ sequential rounds of boosting. As $r$ ranges from $1,\\dots,R$, we try to obtain a classifier that has error at most $1/2-\\gamma$ with respect to $D_r$. We simply do this by checking if there was a hypothesis in the $r$th chunk that has such an error with respect to $D_r$ using the sample we had (which, notably, was from $D_1$). If we do find such a hypothesis, we do a standard boosting update to derive $D_{r+1}$. Assuming that the hypotheses in each step had the required errors with respect to $D_r$, we can imagine that each step works correctly as a standard boosting step, and hence, in each of the $p$ rounds, we are in fact doing $R$ rounds of boosting (and hence, $p$ can be a factor $R$ smaller than standard AdaBoost).\n\n\nBut do the hypotheses in each step have the required properties? When we have a sample from $D_1$, we can simply see if a hypothesis has error at most $1/2-\\gamma$ with respect to $D_1$ by checking the error of the hypothesis on the sample itself --- this follows from standard uniform convergence of VC classes. However, what if we have a sample from $D_1$, but want to check if a hypothesis has error at most $1/2-\\gamma$ with respect to $D_2$? Can we still use the empirical error on the sample as a proxy? In fact, this is what the algorithm is doing in each boosting step. Intuitively, if the distributions $D_2$ and $D_1$ are ""close"", this should still work. But note that we make exponential updates to $D_1$ in the boosting step, so it is not obvious at all that $D_2$ should be close to $D_1$. Lyu et al. (2024) control the max-divergence between $D_2$ and $D_1$, and show that this recipe works by using sophisticated tools like advanced composition from differential privacy. This is where the authors diverge (no pun intended): instead of the max-divergence, the authors control the KL divergence between $D_2$ and $D_1$ instead. This is acheieved by using the Gibbs variational principle. The technical analysis seems highly non-trivial, but gets the job done: with good chance over the sample, the empirical error on a sample from $D_1$ is going to be a good proxy for the distributional error on $D_2$, provided the KL divergence between $D_2$ and $D_1$ is small. If the KL is not small, then the authors show that progress has already been made. In this way, by tracking KL divergence instead of the max-divergence, the authors are able to improve over the bound of Lyu et al. (2024).\n\n### **Lower bound**\n\nThe analysis for deriving the improved lower bound is much more involved. We first start by describing the high level construction in Lyu et al. (2024). The ground truth hypothesis is a random concept $c$ on a domain twice the size of the training set. The hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$ that the weak learner operates over is also constructed randomly. In particular, it contains $c$, and also $p$ other hypothesis $h_1,\\dots,h_p$, where each $h_i$ on each $x$ agrees with $c$ with probability $1/2+2\\gamma$. The VC dimension of this class can be controlled in terms of $p$. Now, whenever the weak learner gets queried with a distribution $D$, if it can satisfy this query by returning a hypothesis that is not $c$, it does so. The goal is to argue that the weak learner can get away with never having to return $c$ at all in any round. If this is the case, what the learning algorithm knows about the rest of the domain is only in the form of $2\\gamma$-biased coins. By instantiating the lower bound on learning the bias of a coin, we get a lower bound on the number of rounds.\n\nLyu et al. (2024) require the number of queries $t$ in each round to be sufficiently small for the weak learner to never return $c$. The main observation by the authors is that, indeed, it is possible to use a much bigger bias than $2\\gamma$ in the construction of $h_i,\\dots,h_p$. That is, each hypothesis can be biased towards $c$ to a much larger extent (as much as $\\sqrt{\\ln(m)/p} \\gg 2\\gamma$). This lets them relax the number of allowed queries $t$ per round, which ultimately yields the stronger lower bound.'}, 'soundness': {'value': 4}, 'presentation': {'value': 4}, 'contribution': {'value': 4}, 'strengths': {'value': ""This paper essentially completes the characterization of the tradeoff between the number of sequential rounds and the parallel work in each round in boosting algorithms.

Existing models to learn the diffusion terms from observational data rely on complex bilevel optimization problems and model only the drift of the system.We propose a new simple model, JKOnet , which bypasses the complexity of existing architectures while presenting significantly enhanced representational capabilities: JKOnet recovers the potential, interaction, and internal energy components of the underlying diffusion process. JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss and outperforms other baselines in terms of sample efficiency, computational complexity, and accuracy. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals, and, when applied to predict the evolution of cellular processes from real-world data, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost of all existing methods.Our methodology is based on the interpretation of diffusion processes as energy-minimizing trajectories in the probability space via the so-called JKO scheme, which we study via its first-order optimality conditions.",Oral Session 1C: Optimization and Learning Theory,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=y10avdRFNK,https://openreview.net/forum?id=y10avdRFNK,y10avdRFNK,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'The paper presents improved methods for learning energy functionals governing a diffusion process from population snapshots observed over time.

Thanks!\n\n### Weakness 2 \nWe agree that the introduction blends with the related works rather abruptly. We thus prepared a revised version in which we smoothed it, gradually adding information for the reader less familiar with the literature.\n\nFor instance, we will add the paragraph ""However, the JKO scheme entails an optimization problem in the probability space. Thus,  the problem of finding the energy functional that minimizes a prediction error (w.r.t. observational data) takes the form of a computationally-challenging infinite-dimensional bilevel optimization problem, whereby the upper-level problem is the minimization of the prediction error and the lower-level problem is the JKO scheme."" to better introduce the reader to what the bilevel optimization problem is about.\n    \nWe also removed the focus from Figure 1 in the introduction.\n\n### Weakness 3\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out this difference, which in fact is a strength of our method which we did not highlight appropriately and we hope we now did in the Remark 3.6 we prepared for the next revision of the paper. In a nutshell, it is true that $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*}$ requires the construction of the optimal transport couplings beforehand. However, $\\mathrm{JKOnet}$ constructs a new optimal transport plan at each iteration depending on the current estimate of the potential, whereas $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*}$ needs to do so only once, at the beginning. We prepared a revision of the paper in which we added the time required to compute the optimal transport couplings in Section 4.1 ($0.03 \\pm 0.01$s), and we provided an analysis of the comparison between Sinkhorn and plain linear programming for our scope in the newly added Figure 10 in Appendix C.2, which we now expanded (we report Figure 10 in the PDF attached to this rebuttal, and we will include the extended version of the Appendix C.2 for the next revision of the paper). We also better argued why the scaling to high-dimensions remains unaffected by the computation of the optimal transport couplings: the dimensionality affects only the construction of the cost matrix in the linear program, and otherwise the computational complexity of the linear program only relates to the number of particles. When the number of particles grows, one can apply the same batching applied in other methods to pre-compute the couplings. We add details regarding these practical considerations in the revised Appendix C.2. Finally, following the comments from reviewer vNRb, we introduced a real-world case study on learning and predicting molecular processes (see Figure 5 and the comparison table in the attached document). This way, we hope we strengthen our contributions not only by achieving state-of-the-art on a real-world application but doing so in under a minute of training (including the computation of the optimal transport couplings) compared to the hours required by the other methods.\n\n### Question 1\nThanks for pointing out the notation confusion. We defined $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*_l}$ only later on, so now we introduced in the caption to clarify we refer to the linear parametrization.\n\n### Question 2\nThanks for pointing this out. We agree that this is an important point and we will discuss it in the revised version of the paper. In particular, the dimensionality affects only the construction of the cost matrix in the linear program associated with the optimal transport problem, and otherwise the complexity is only related to the number of particles. Specifically, the time required to construct the cost matrix scales linearly with the dimension, and in practice it is minimal and dwarfed by the actual solution of the linear program. When the number of particles grows, one can apply the same batching that is applied in other methods to pre-compute the couplings. We add details regarding these practical considerations in the revision of Appendix C.2. Please see also point 3 above.\n\n### Question 3\nThanks for observing the performance gains and pointing out this aspect. We prepared a revision of Section 4.1 in which we added a paragraph highlighting also the performance gains and discussing linear vs non-linear. In particular, the linear approximation has optimality guarantees, as long as the features are sufficiently rich. In high dimensions, however, the choice of feature is challenging and, thus, we recommend resorting to non-linear parametrizations.'}}, 'id': 'fn0jdllVKr', 'forum': 'y10avdRFNK', 'replyto': 'YxSGqQR3XZ', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission17735/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission17735/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission17735/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722809123995, 'cdate': 1722809123995, 'tmdate': 1730883844846, 'mdate': 1730883844846, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': '### Weakness 1\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion.

We have a dedicated section in Appendix B, which we now expanded to discuss the prediction schemes as well, and we have added an introduction to the problems in the experimental section. In particular, we added the data-generation equation, in which the role of the functionals $V(x)$ is apparent: $x_{t+1} = x_t - \\tau \\nabla V(x_t)$. We also added the name and equation of each functional in the figures where it was not listed (e.g., Figure 2).\n\n### Question 1\nThanks for the question. In our implementation, we solved the optimal transport problems via plain linear programming (using the POT python library). We prepared an updated version of Appendix C.2 that we will include in the revision of the paper that contains an analysis of the impact of different ways of solution algorithms on the final outcome in terms of computational time during pre-processing and Wasserstein error (see Figure 10 in the attached PDF). In particular, we conclude that, as long as the couplings are close to the correct one, the algorithm used to compute them does not impact the performance of $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*}$. Since small regularizers slow down the Sinkhorn algorithm, we opted to directly solve the linear program (without regularization). In general, the solver choice can be considered an additional knob that researchers and practitioners can tune when deploying $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*}$. Please see also point 3 above.\n    \n### Question 2\nOnce an energy functional through $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*}$ is learned, the equilibrium state of the system can be inferred in two ways. A simple approach consists of running sufficiently many iterations of the JKO scheme until an equilibrium is reached. Alternatively, the equilibrium state is well-known to be the minimum of the energy functional. Thus, the equilibrium state can be inferred by computing the probability distribution which minimizes the energy functionals, using tools from optimization in the probability space.'}}, 'id': 'sbn0ctHxe1', 'forum': 'y10avdRFNK', 'replyto': '0i18x4FbZP', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission17735/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission17735/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission17735/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722809029727, 'cdate': 1722809029727, 'tmdate': 1730883844848, 'mdate': 1730883844848, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': '### Weakness 1\n\nWe thank the reviewer for suggesting us one way to strengthen the presentation of our contributions. \n\nWe deployed our method to learn the diffusion dynamics of embryoid body single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data [1], a popular benchmark in the literature, and compared our results with nine other recent methods in the literature. We discuss the application and the results in the newly added Section 4.4, which will appear in future versions of the paper, and we report the related figure and table in the PDF attached to this response. We briefly summarize our experimental setting and results below. \n\nExperimental setting (briefly): We follow the same data pre-processing as in [2,3]; in particular, we use the same processed artifacts of the embryoid data provided in their work, which contains the first 100 components of the principal components analysis (PCA) of the data and, following [2,3], we focus on the first five. We train on $60\\%$ of the data at each time-step and test $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*}$ to predict the evolution of the left-out data.\n\nResults: $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*}$ outperforms all existing methods in the literature (see the results table in the PDF attached). Importantly, our training takes less than a minute (including the computation of optimal transport plans), whereas the training time of all other existing methods takes hours.\n\nWe visualize the 2 principal components and the interpolations obtained with our method in Figure 5. Note that, for this application, we used a time-varying potential energy, of which we plot the level curves.\n    \n### Weakness 2\n\nWe believe our approach might underperform in the following two cases. \n\nFirst, while diffusion processes include many real-world phenomena, in some real-world applications it might be unknown if the particles are undergoing diffusion. If this is not the case, $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*}$ might underperform. For instance, in the absence of noise and interaction energy, if the vector field is not the gradient of some potential energy function (e.g., it includes a solenoidal component $\\nabla \\times \\psi$ for some function $\\psi: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$), we cannot expect $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*}$ (as well as any other method learning a potential) to infer a reasonable potential. We prepared a dedicated section that we will include in the revision of the paper to discuss this failure mode.\n\nSecond, when learning both potential and interaction energy and noise level, there might be observability issues that prevent the distinction of the different components of the energy functional (e.g., a discrete-time population-level effect might be explained both by a potential energy and a noise level).\n\nWhile we did not experience this issue in our experiments in Section 4.3, we are not aware of rigorous guarantees that ensure observability. In a dedicated section in Appendix G, we provide a small-scale analytical example illustrating this issue. As $\\mathrm{JKOnet^*}$ is the only method capable of simultaneously learning all three energy components, we believe it can serve as the baseline to investigate this observability issue.\n    \n### Weakness 3\n\nWe compared our method with others in our real-world application, discussed in 1) above and in Section 4.4 in the revised version of the paper. \n\n### Question 1, 2\n\nPlease refer to our answer to Weakness 1) above. \n\n### Question 3\n\nIn our experiments, we considered only vanilla parametrizations: two-layers MLP with 64 neurons in each layer, to compare directly with the other works in the literature. What is certainly required is a network that is expressive enough to approximate the energy functional of interest, so standard rationales apply for the choice of activation functions (we use softplus), dimension of the networks, etc. One of the limitations of our works is the data domain (we do not explore, e.g., images). We plan in future work to do so, and in that case more care will be needed to determine the most suitable architecture. Given that the same architecture and hyperparameters worked well across all the experiments (including the real-world experiment), we are confident to state that the learning algorithm itself is not particularly sensitive to the network architecture, which needs of course be chosen to be suitable to represent the energy in the application of choice. We also believe that exciting future work can be done in terms of understanding how different architectures can capture potential, internal, and interaction energies more efficiently: can e.g., transformers be used to learn an interaction energy more efficiently than a vanilla MLP?\n\n[1] ""Visualizing structure and transitions in high-dimensional biological data"" by Kevin R Moon, David van Dijk, Zheng Wang, Scott Gigante, Daniel B Burkhardt, William S Chen, Kristina Yim, Antonia van den Elzen, Matthew J Hirn, Ronald R Coifman, et al.

However, traditional approaches frequently encounter issues like over-segmentation or mis-segmentation, due to insufficient emphasis on spatial information of instances. In this paper, we introduce a Rule-Guided Spatial Awareness Network (RG-SAN) by utilizing solely the spatial information of the target instance for supervision. This approach enables the network to accurately depict the spatial relationships among all entities described in the text, thus enhancing the reasoning capabilities. The RG-SAN consists of the Text-driven Localization Module (TLM) and the Rule-guided Weak Supervision (RWS) strategy. The TLM initially locates all mentioned instances and iteratively refines their positional information. The RWS strategy, acknowledging that only target objects have supervised positional information, employs dependency tree rules to precisely guide the core instance’s positioning. Extensive testing on the ScanRefer benchmark has shown that RG-SAN not only establishes new performance benchmarks, with an mIoU increase of 5.1 points, but also exhibits significant improvements in robustness when processing descriptions with spatial ambiguity.

64) |\n| Point 9 | (8.0, 9.0, 10.0) | (192, 192, 192) |\n\n**Where:**\n\n- The `xyz` column represents the coordinates (x, y, z) of the point cloud, indicating the three-dimensional spatial positions relative to the scene center (0, 0, 0) in the scene coordinate system.\n- The `rgb` column denotes the color (r, g, b) of the point cloud.\n\nAn example of the 3D absolute positional encoding is as follows:\n\n| Point Index | xyz | Point Feature | Positional Encoding | Final Embedding |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Point 1 | (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) | PointFeat 1 | PosEmb(1.0, 2.0, 3.0) |

PosEmb(7.0, 8.0, 9.0) | PointFeat 3 + PosEmb(7.0, 8.0, 9.0) |\n| Point 4 | (1.5, 2.5, 3.5) | PointFeat 4 | PosEmb(1.5, 2.5, 3.5) | PointFeat 4 + PosEmb(1.5, 2.5, 3.5) |\n| Point 5 | (4.5, 5.5, 6.5) |

(2.0, 3.0, 4.0) | PointFeat 7 | PosEmb(2.0, 3.0, 4.0) | PointFeat 7 + PosEmb(2.0, 3.0, 4.0) |\n| Point 8 | (5.0, 6.0, 7.0) | PointFeat 8 | PosEmb(5.0, 6.0, 7.0) | PointFeat 8 + PosEmb(5.0, 6.0, 7.0) |\n| Point 9 | (8.0, 9.0, 10.0) | PointFeat 9 | PosEmb(8.0, 9.0, 10.0) | PointFeat 9 + PosEmb(8.0, 9.0, 10.0) |\n\n**Where:**\n\n- The **Point Cloud Feature (PointFeat)** column represents the features of the point cloud using `PointFeat`.\n- The **Positional Encoding (PosEmb)** column displays the positional encoding for each point in the point cloud, where `PosEmb` denotes the positional encoding function.\n- The **Final Feature (PointFeat + PosEmb)** column illustrates the combined result of the point cloud features and the positional encoding, represented as `PointFeat` plus `PosEmb`.\n\nIn 3D encoding, even if the input order is changed, each point’s representation remains consistent, and thus, the final output remains unchanged. However, positional information is still inherently embedded within the point cloud.

This is a technical flawless.\n> \n\n**FA2:** Thank you very much for your feedback. To clarify this concern further, we will explain the rationale behind positional encoding to ensure better understanding.\n\n**(1) Input Order vs. Positional Information:**\n\nFirstly, changing the input order is not equivalent to altering the positional information of the inputs. Therefore, stating that the output remains unaffected by changing the input order does not imply that positional encoding is irrelevant. In fact, as shown in Table 3 of our paper, incorporating appropriate positional encoding can improve performance by 0.6 to 1.2 points. Although this improvement may not be as significant as the gains from our core module, positional encoding remains a classic operation in computer vision. We have retained this module as a byproduct of modeling positional information in our work. We will now provide examples to illustrate the difference between altering input order and positional information in the follow.\n\n**(2) 2D Positional Encoding vs. 3D Positional Encoding:**\n\nUnlike 2D positional encoding, which typically uses indices, 3D point clouds exhibit unordered and sparse characteristics, making index-based encoding unsuitable. Instead, 3D positional encoding employs Fourier encodings of the 3D coordinates (xyz), where `xyz` represents the spatial positions of the point cloud relative to the scene center (0, 0, 0). We will further illustrate the difference between these two approaches and how input order affects them in the following **part-2**.'}}, 'id': '5B3RhcOuQb', 'forum': 'r5spnrY6H3', 'replyto': 'b7qlCvIKEw', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9950/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9950/Authors'], 'number': 7, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9950/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723530524218, 'cdate': 1723530524218, 'tmdate': 1730889596032, 'mdate': 1730889596032, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': ""Thanks for the detailed rebuttal.

Sec. 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 and Eq. (7) to (12) resemble those in [22]. Spatial information in 3D visual grounding has been explored, like [6].\n> \n\nA1: Thank you for your valuable feedback. Indeed we acknowledge that our use of positional encoding is based on previous methods[51][22]. However, our primary contribution lies in modeling the spatial positions and relationships of noun entities within sentences for the 3D-RES task, which has also been recognized by reviewers p7dx, 8gkL, and MnE2. This approach has two core differences compared to [22]:\n\n(1) Unlike [22], which uses zero initialization for queries and random initialization for positional information, our queries and positions are text-driven from the start. This improves mIoU by 4.4 points, as shown in Tab. 2 and the newly added Tab. A.\n\n(2) Unlike [22], which supervises all target instances\' positions, in 3D-RES, only the core target word is supervised. Our novel RWS method constructs spatial relationships for all noun instances using only the target word\'s positional information, improving mIoU by 2.3 points, as shown in Tab. 4.\n\n| Method | Initialization method of Queries | Initialization method of Position | Multiple mIoU | Overall mIoU |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MAFT [22] | Zero | Random | 29.7 | 37.9 |\n|  | Text-driven | Random | 30.1 | 38.8 |\n| RG-SAN w/o RWS | Text-driven | Text-driven | 34.7 | 42.3 |\n| RG-SAN (Ours) | Text-driven | Text-driven | 37.4 | 44.6 |\n\nTable A: Comparison of MAFT [22] with our RG-SAN in ScanRefer Dataset.\n\n**In summary, our core innovation lies in constructing spatial positional information, rather than just using positional encoding, as done in [6].** Using positional encoding is a regular operation after generating spatial information. We also explored other positional encodings, such as 5D Euclidean RPE, achieving similar results in Tab. 2.\n\nFollowing your suggestion, we will further compare and analyze our work with the highly relevant and interesting study [22] in the new version to clarify our contributions.\n\n---\n\n> **Q2: The writing needs improvement: K_i (line 120) and c_i (line 123) are not defined, P^t in Eq. (3) with two subscripts is inconsistent with P^t in Eq. (5), and Table t (line 166) and q (Eq. 7) are not introduced.**\n> \n\nA2: Thank you for your detailed feedback. We adopted the representation from [28] to formulate our approach as concisely as possible. Following your suggestion, we will make improvements in new version.\n\n---\n\n> **Q3: The TLM module resembles [22]\'s architecture. Have you compared their performance on ScanRefer in Tab. 1?**\n> \n\nA3: Thank you for your constructive suggestions. We conducted a detailed comparison with [22] in Q1A1 and reported the suggested performance. Our proposed RG-SAN improves by 6.7 points, demonstrating its effectiveness. We will include this discussion in new version. Your suggestions will enhance the robustness of our contributions.\n\n---\n\n> **Q4: In Eq. (2), how do you initialize W_E and W_S to obtain initial representations?**\n> \n\nA4: Thank you for your attention to the details of our paper. In Eq. (2), W_E and W_S are initialized randomly. We will include this information in new version to enhance clarity.\n\n---\n\n> **Q5: For Eq. (5), what is the intuition of adding positional encoding to position features? Does the order of visual features impact the attention output?**\n> \n\nA5:  Thank you for your constructive question. Adding absolute position encoding is common in computer vision [51]. Changing the input order of visual features does not affect the final attention output because (1) the attention mechanism is order-invariant, and (2) the position encoding is tied to the visual tokens\' 3D positions (xyz), so altering input order does not impact these positions.\n\n---\n\n> **Q6: Why is positional encoding added in Eq. (6) but concatenated in Eqs. (9) and (10)?**\n> \n\nA6: Thank you for your insightful inquiry. Our experiments show that addition and concatenation for positional encoding in Eq. (6), (9), and (10) yield similar results, as shown in Tab. B. The differences are negligible, so either approach can be used without significantly impacting the outcome.\n\n| Eq. (6) | Eqs. (9), (10) | Unique mIoU | Multiple mIoU | Overall mIoU |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cat |  Cat | 74.6 | 37.4 | 44.6 |\n| Cat | Add | 74.7 | 37.4 | 44.7 |\n| Add | Cat | 74.5 | 37.4 | 44.6 |\n| Add | Add | 75.1 | 37.5 | 44.8 |\n\nTable B: Ablation of positional encoding usage, where ""Cat"" denotes concatenation, while ""Add"" denotes direct addition. \n\n---\n\n> **Q7: Evaluation of RTS for finding the target.**\n> \n\nA7: Thank you for your question. We previously evaluated RTS\'s ability to find the target using LLAMA2 70B in Sec. F of the supplementary materials, achieving an 80% match rate. However, LLAMA2 is not entirely accurate, making it an unreliable benchmark.\n\nTo better validate RTS, we annotated the text of 9,508 Val set samples to mark the target word positions. RTS achieved an accuracy of 93.4%, compared to 63.7% for the Top1 method, confirming our algorithm\'s effectiveness.\n\nWe will include this evaluation in new version and open-source the annotations to ensure reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n> **Q8: The explanation for Tab. 4 points out Top1 tends to select different nodes variably (line 281), but RTS is also choosing different nodes?**\n> \n\nA8: We apologize for the confusion. In line 281, ""different"" refers to predicted nodes that are not the target noun word. Top1 often selects nodes other than the target word, such as adjectives or verbs, leading to semantic confusion and an accuracy of only 63.7%.\n\nIn contrast, RTS accurately identifies the target word based on syntax, regardless of its position, achieving an accuracy of 93.4% as Q7A7 points out. This precise selection enhances semantic accuracy and significantly improves performance, as shown in Tab. 4.\n\nWe will revise the description in new version to improve clarity.'}}, 'id': 'DCSobkLlFU', 'forum': 'r5spnrY6H3', 'replyto': '7bz2rdQmNq', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9950/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9950/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9950/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722961749554, 'cdate': 1722961749554, 'tmdate': 1730882261633, 'mdate': 1730882261633, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewers for their valuable feedback and positive comments on our paper.

Now, we\'ll address the specific concerns you\'ve raised to provide further clarification:\n\n---\n\n> **Q1: RG-SAN adopts superpoints as fundamental visual units for feature extraction and segmentation. While previous works have employed similar approaches, I am interested in understanding the segmentation quality of superpoints themselves. For instance, how many superpoints exist solely within individual objects? This is crucial because if a superpoint spans across two objects, it inevitably affects the segmentation results.**\n> \n\nA1: Thank you for your insightful feedback. In practice, due to the fine granularity of superpoints and their tendency to aggregate semantically similar points, most superpoints cover only a single object. To verify this, we conducted a statistical analysis of the superpoints in the ScanRefer [5] dataset. If a superpoint contains points from more than one object, it is classified as containing multiple objects; otherwise, it is categorized as containing a single object. Our analysis reveals that 99.55% of the points are within superpoints that cover a single object, with a missing probability of less than 0.5%. This indicates that the issue of multiple objects within a single superpoint has a negligible impact on the final results and does not warrant special attention.\n\n---\n\n> **Q2: RG-SAN trains spatial awareness networks using the centroid coordinates of target objects. Here, does ""object center"" refer to the geometric centroid or the center of mass (where the former denotes the center of the bounding box and the latter denotes the mean coordinate of all points belonging to the object)? Given the inherent sparsity of point clouds, these two centers may exhibit significant differences.**\n> \n\nA2: Thank you for your valuable comments. We use the centroid of all superpoints belonging to an object, representing the average coordinates of these superpoints. We conducted comparative experiments between this centroid setting and another centroid setting. As shown in Table A, the results indicate no significant differences between the two approaches.\n\nWe will include this discussion in the revised version to enhance the clarity of the paper.\n\n| Setting | Unique mIoU | Multiple mIoU | Overall mIoU |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Center of Box | 74.8 | 37.4 | 44.7 |\n| Center of Mass | 74.5 | 37.4 | 44.6 |\n\nTable A: Comparison of the Center of Box and Center of Mass.\n\n---\n\n> **Q3: The statistical analysis of the importance of spatial information for 3D-RES should be included in the main text. This will help readers understand the motivation of the paper from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives.**\n> \n\nA3: Thank you for your suggestion. We will include the statistical analysis on the importance of spatial information for 3D-RES in the paper to enhance the rigor of the paper.\n\n---\n\n> **Q4: Although this paper discusses its limitations, it does not provide failure cases or corresponding analyses. Specifically, for the segmentation of plural nouns, it remains unclear whether only one object is recognized or if segmentation fails altogether. It would be beneficial to include either qualitative or quantitative analysis in this regard. Including this part would make the paper more comprehensive and facilitate follow-up research and improvements.**\n> \n\nA4: Thanks for your insightful suggestion. We will include visualizations of failure cases and provide a qualitative analysis in the new version.\n\n---\n\n> **Q5: Does ""object center"" in this paper refer to the geometric centroid (center of the bounding box) or the center of mass (mean coordinate of all points)?**\n> \n\nA5:  Thank you for your detailed question.

If not, what's the missing rate?**\n> \n\nA3: We appreciate your insightful feedback. The superpoint generation mechanism in RG-SAN ensures that no instances are missed, as the superpoints comprehensively cover the entire scene. Superpoints are essentially fine-grained fragments that group semantically similar points together. They do not overlap with each other and collectively constitute the whole scene, guaranteeing that all objects are included within superpoints. This setup ensures that every object is included within the superpoints, as detailed in the upper left corner of Figure 2 in our paper. Therefore, the issue of missing objects does not arise in our framework.\n\n---\n\n> **Q4: The layout of Tables 2 and 3 is off, and the font in Figure 2 is too small.

We investigate the trade-off between sample and communication complexity for the widely used class of intermittent communication algorithms. We first establish the converse result, where we show that any Federated Q-learning that offers a linear speedup with respect to number of agents in sample complexity needs to incur a communication cost of at least $\Omega(\frac{1}{1-\gamma})$, where $\gamma$ is the discount factor. We also propose a new Federated Q-learning algorithm, called Fed-DVR-Q, which is the first Federated Q-learning algorithm to simultaneously achieve order-optimal sample and communication complexities. Thus, together these results provide a complete characterization of the sample-communication complexity trade-off in Federated Q-learning.",Oral Session 2B: Reinforcement Learning,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6YIpvnkjUK,https://openreview.net/forum?id=6YIpvnkjUK,6YIpvnkjUK,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'The paper explores the trade-off between sample complexity and communication complexity in federated Q-learning.

We consider a MDP with 3 states, namely $\\{0,1,2\\}$ and 2 actions, where the reward and transition kernel of states $0$ and $1$ are identical to those in the MDP outlined in Appendix B.1 in the paper. The reward and transition kernel for state $2$ is identical to that of state $1$. The values of $\\gamma$ and $p$ are set to $0.9$ and $0.8$ respectively. We perform two empirical studies. In the first study, we compare the proposed algorithm Fed-DVR-Q to the Fed-SynQ algorithm proposed in Woo et al., 2023. The parameters for both the algorithms were set to the suggested values in the respective papers. As evident from Fig 1, Fed-DVR-Q achieves a smaller error than Fed-SynQ in the same sample budget. Similarly, Fed-DVR-Q also requires much lesser communication (measured in number of bits transmitted) than Fed-SynQ demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach and corroborating our theoretical results. In the second experiment, we study the effect of the number of agents on the sample and communication complexity of Fed-DVR-Q. The sample complexity decreases as $1/M$ demonstrating the linear speed-up while the communication complexity is independent of the number of agents.

Both the studies mentioned by the reviewer focus on best-arm identification in bandits, which is different problem from learning the optimal Q-function in RL using Q-learning due the markovian structure of the responses and the different objective functions. As a result, both the algorithmic design and analysis are quite different in these papers from those in our work. The lower bound in [1] is established using the heterogeneity across clients. On the other hand, the lower bound in our work is based on the bias-variance trade-off of Q-learning. Similarly, the algorithm design in both [1] and [2] are based on arm-elimination approaches which is different from the variance reduced stochastic fixed point iteration used in our work.

We appreciate the time and effort you spent on our paper and the helpful comments you provided. Please find our itemized responses to your questions below.\n\nQ1. Can you quantify the benefit of variance reduction in the upper bound? That is, what would the sample complexity be if we looked at a variant of your algorithm without the variance reduction part of the update rule? Doesn't the variance reduction technique typically lead to an improvement in terms of the constants in the sample complexity? I am a bit surprised to see that variance reduction is needed even to guarantee order optimal sample and communication complexities.\n\nA1. For Q-learning, it is well-known that some form of variance reduction presents in all existing algorithm designs that achieve the optimal sample complexity with respect to $\\gamma$. In [LCCWC23], the authors demonstrated that vanilla Q-learning, i.e., without variance reduction, has a sample complexity that is necessarily sub-optimal by a factor of $1/(1-\\gamma)$. Thus, some form of variance reduction is crucial to achieve the optimal sample complexity. In absence of variance reduction, our algorithm will achieve a sample complexity that is greater than the current one by a factor of $1/(1-\\gamma)$ (along with logarithmic factors).\n\nQ2. Typically, to get convergence to an $\\epsilon$-neighbourhood, the stepsize $\\eta$ should be chosen depending on $\\epsilon.$ For example, see Theorem 2 (a) in [BRS18]. However, in your Theorem 2, it appears $\\eta$ can be any number in $(0, 1).$ This seems a bit surprising. Can you elaborate on why that is the case? Am I overlooking something?\n\nA2. The Theorem 2(a) in [BRS18] is true when the learner updates the Q-function (or the parameter $\\theta$ in their case) after *each* data point/observation from the environment. In other words, the mini-batch size is $1$. On the other hand, our algorithm takes a mini-batch ($\\gg 1$) of samples, collates the information and then updates the Q-function. In both the approaches, the fundamental motivation is to ensure that the variance of stochastic updates is small. In [BRS18], the authors use an update with a large variance and balance it by choosing a small step size. In our work, we allow larger step sizes but require updates with smaller variance (obtained through mini-batching) to ensure updates with low variance.\n\nThe dependence of $\\varepsilon$ is directly through the number of epochs $K$ and indirectly through the choice of $B$ and $J$, as they depend on the parameter $K$.\n\nQ3. Also, it is unclear to me why you claim that your upper bound matches the lower bound. The lower bound is in terms of $N,$ while the upper bound is in terms of $\\epsilon?$ Can you formally show that the two orders match?\n\nA3. The variable $N$ in Theorem 1 is the sample complexity of the algorithm and its relation with the error $\\varepsilon$ can be obtained through equations (4) and (5). Our Theorem 1 states that if the number of communication rounds in algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma})$ (upto logarithmic factors), then the error of the final output is $\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the number of samples taken for each state-action pair at each agent. In other words, in order to obtain $\\varepsilon$-optimal Q-function, each agent needs to take at least $\\Omega(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ samples, i.e., the algorithm offers no linear speed up w.r.t. the number of agents. This is equivalent to saying that if any algorithm is designed such that it only takes $\\mathcal{O}(1/M\\varepsilon^2)$ samples per agent (or offers _any_ speed-up w.r.t. number of agents), then it must have at least $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma})$ rounds of communication. \n\nOur Theorem 2 states that our proposed algorithm Fed-DVR-Q is such that it takes $\\mathcal{O}(1/M\\varepsilon^2)$ samples per state-action pair at each agents and has $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma})$ rounds of communication. Note that this order matches that in the statement of the lower bound, thereby establishing the optimality of communication complexity. The optimality of the sample complexity follows immediately from the lower bound in (Azar et al. 2013). \n\nQ4. Finally, assuming your lower and upper bounds match, can you explain whether the proposed Fed-DVR-Q is a parameter-free algorithm? That is, does it need any knowledge of the unknown parameters of the underlying MDP to achieve order-optimal sample complexity?\n\nA4. Our algorithm Fed-DVR-Q is parameter-free in the sense that it does not require any knowledge of the parameters of underlying MDP. Our algorithm, however, does have several parameters, whose values have been specified in Sec. 4.1.3. of the paper. We also use a hyperparameter $\\eta \\in (0,1)$ corresponding to the step size of the updates. As evident from the bounds in Theorem 2, it is preferable to have values of $\\eta$ close to $1$.\n\n[LCCWC23]: G. Li, C. Cai, Y. Chen, Y. Wei, and Y. Chi.

At a high level, note that after a burn-in period depending on the mixing time of the behaviour policy, the state visitation distribution will be close to the true stationary distribution. From hereon, we can run the algorithm almost as is with a different choice of mini-batch sizes and recentering sample size parameters. Note that the only difference in the asynchronous setting as compared to the generative model will be that the number of samples for each state-action pair will depend on the behaviour policy. By an appropriate choice of mini-batch sizes and recentering sample sizes, we can ensure that the error still decreases by a factor of 2 every epoch. Consequently, similar conclusions on the sample and communication complexity will also hold for the asynchronous setting. We would also like to point out that the sample complexity will be inversely proportional to the minimum *average* state-action visitation probability, similar to (Woo et al, 2023). As shown in that work, that is the best one can hope for and does not require each agent to cover all state-action pairs. \n\nThank you for you helpful question.

The authors mentioned that Theorem 1 is inspired by the analysis of single-agent Q-learning [5] and Theorem 2 is based on the analysis of variance-reduced Q-learning [6]. The authors should elaborate on how their analysis differs from the single-agent case, what new challenges arise in the federated setting, and what novel techniques are employed to overcome these challenges. Additionally, can these techniques be generalized to other settings?_\n\nOne of the challenges in federated setting over the results in [5] and [6] is the design of the communication schedule and its interplay with the convergence of the algorithm to the optimal Q-function. We mention that our analysis is inspired by [5] as we use the same hard instance used in that work and the authors in [5] also use bias-variance trade-off to establish sub-optimality of sample complexity of Q-learning. However, in terms of establishing our lower bound, none of the lemmas from the analysis of single agent Q-learning in [5] can be trivially adopted for the federated learning scenario considered in our work as behaviour of all agents affects that of the others. This requires us to establish all technical results from scratch. Moreover, the communication schedule directly affects the bias-variance trade-off in the federated setting which needs to be carefully analyzed and balanced. Establishing the impact of communication on this trade-off is central to establishing the lower bound in our work. In our analysis, we establish how the time interval between two communication rounds affects the bias and the variance terms. This allows us to show that infrequent communication results in a higher bias term preventing linear speed-up with the number of agents. This analyses and conclusions are completely novel compared to the single-agent analysis in [5] especially because there is no communication involved in single-agent setting and the focus of their analysis is on establishing the sample complexity. Furthermore, the interplay of communication and bias-variance trade-off can be used to conclude communication bounds for more general problems of distributed stochastic fixed point iteration, specifically with non-linear operators. For example, a similar analysis yields that distributed optimization of strongly convex functions using SGD requires a communication cost proportional to the condition number of the function. Thus, the proposed techniques in this work have implications beyond RL.\n\nA direct extension of the algorithm in [6] to the federated setting results in a sub-optimal sample and communication complexities similar to (Woo et al, 2023). The novelty in our work to show that using minibatching as opposed local updates helps manage the bias-variance trade-off (referred to the in lower bound) much better enabling us to achieve optimal sample and communication complexities. As mentioned earlier, this observation carries forward to other distributed stochastic fixed point iteration problems, thereby providing a template to design algorithms that operate at the optimal point in sample-communication complexity trade-off curve. Since our algorithm design is different from that in [6], we need to derive newer results to establish Theorem 2. Lastly, the impact of communication and quantization prevents us from directly adopting the results in [6] and requires a more careful and novel analysis to ensure the optimal convergence rates.\n\nThank you for pointing this out.

This seems to contrast starkly with the authors' claim that infrequent communication does not speed up sample complexity. Could the authors clarify this discrepancy and discuss how their work relates to these results?_\n\nOur result does not violate the results obtained in the existing studies on federated TD learning [1,2]. The key difference here is that the results in [1,2] consider TD learning to learn the value function directly instead of Q-function. If TD-learning is used to learn the value function directly, then the resultant algorithm aims to learn the fixed point of the operator $\\mathcal{T}\\_{TD} : \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{S}|} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{S}|}$ given as $\\mathcal{T}\\_{TD}(V)(s) := r(s) + \\sum_{s'} P(s,s')V(s')$, where $r$ and $P$ are reward and probability transition matrices respectively. Note that this is a **linear** function of $V$. On the other hand, our work focuses on learning the optimal Q-function via Q-learning. Specifically, we learn the fixed point of the operator $\\mathcal{T}\\_{QL} : \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{S}| |\\mathcal{A}|} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{S}| |\\mathcal{A}|}$ given by $\\mathcal{T}\\_{QL}(Q)(s,a) := r(s,a) + \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [\\max\\_{a'} Q(s',a')]$. Note that this function is a **non-linear** function of $Q$. \n\nThe difference in the communication requirement stems from the fact that the linearity of the Bellman operator in terms of the value allows one-shot averaging to be sufficient to achieve optimal error rates. On the other hand, the non-linearity of Bellman operator with respect to the Q-function results in one-shot averaging to be no longer sufficient to achieve optimal error rates. \n\nIf the operator whose fixed point is to be found is linear in the decision variable (e.g., the value function in TD learning) then the fixed point update only induces a variance term corresponding to the noise. However, if the operator is non-linear, then in addition to the variance term, we also obtain a *bias* term in the fixed point update. While the variance term can be controlled with one-shot averaging, more frequent communication is necessary to ensure that the bias term is small enough. A discussion regarding this difference between TD learning and Q-learning can also be found in [5] (from your comment) where the authors show that TD learning achieves the optimal sample complexity but Q-learning (without variance reduction) is necessarily sub-optimal in terms on dependence on $\\gamma$.\n\nThank you for highlighting this interesting point. We will add this discussion in the revised version of the paper.\n\n- _The related work section on Distributed RL is generally comprehensive; however, it omits some recent works on heterogeneous FedRL [3,4]._\n\nThank you for pointing out the additional papers. We will add them in the related work section. [3] adopts a policy optimization perspective, which is different from the Q-learning paradigm considered in this work. Moreover, the algorithm in [3] obtains a linear communication cost, which is worse than that obtained in our work.

"['Yang Peng', 'Liangyu Zhang', 'Zhihua Zhang']",NeurIPS,Statistical Efficiency of Distributional Temporal Difference Learning,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97962,2024," Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved empirical success in various domains.One of the core tasks in the field of DRL is distributional policy evaluation, which involves estimating the return distribution $\eta^\pi$ for a given policy $\pi$.The distributional temporal difference learning has been accordingly proposed, whichis an extension of the temporal difference learning (TD) in the classic RL area.In the tabular case,  Rowland et al. [2018] and Rowland et al. [2023] proved the asymptotic convergence of two instances of distributional TD, namely categorical temporal difference learning (CTD) and quantile temporal difference learning (QTD), respectively.In this paper, we go a step further and analyze the finite-sample performance of distributional TD.To facilitate theoretical analysis, we propose a non-parametric distributional TD learning (NTD).For a $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision process,we show that for NTD we need $\widetilde O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2p}(1-\gamma)^{2p+1}}\right)$ iterations to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal estimator with high probability, when the estimation error is measured by the $p$-Wasserstein distance.This sample complexity bound is minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) in the case of the $1$-Wasserstein distance.To achieve this, we establish a novel Freedman's inequality in Hilbert spaces, which would be of independent interest.In addition, we revisit CTD, showing that the same non-asymptotic convergence bounds hold for CTD in the case of the $p$-Wasserstein distance.",Oral Session 2C: Reinforcement Learning,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=eWUM5hRYgH,https://openreview.net/forum?id=eWUM5hRYgH,eWUM5hRYgH,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'The reviewers are generally strongly positive that this paper makes substantive contributions to understanding the sample complexity of distributional RL that are enabled by interesting technical contributions.

From our perspective,\nmany important works in the ML theory community focus on improving existing\ntheoretical results. We would like to stress that our improvement is especially\nsignificant as we actually prove the near-minimax-optimal sample complexity\nbounds. We would also like to clarify the problem setting in our paper. The\nsetting we adopt is called the synchronous setting, which can be widely seen in\nthe RL theory literature [Wainwright, 2019, Li et al., 2024]. Such a setting is\nalso adopted in the asymptotic and non-asymptotic analysis of distributional TD\nas mentioned by the reviewer [Rowland et al., 2018, 2023, Bock and Heitzinger,\n2022].

But we kindly disagree\nwith the reviewer’s comment that the proposed Freedman’s inequality can be\nviewed as a main theoretical contribution only in a stochastic approximation\npaper in applied probability instead of RL. As the novel Freedman’s inequality\nis developed as a key technique tool for our theoretical analysis, we feel\nit can be an important theoretical contribution of this paper. And we thank\nthe reviewer for the suggestion that we should better posit such a contribution\n(possibly following the advice of Reviewer bMoZ to add it to the main paper).\n\n> Weakness 4: The writing ... sample-based TD methods.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the comment about the typo and have fixed it.\nWe would appreciate it if the reviewer could point out the parts he/she feels are\nhard to understand, which could greatly help us to improve the quality of our\npaper. We are glad to include the paper [Wenliang et al., 2023] in our literature\nreview. We would also discuss more papers on sample-based TD as the reviewer\nsuggests.\n\n> Questions: How to show ... verify them?\n\nSince the value function $V^\\pi(s)=\\mathbb{E}_{G\\sim\\eta^\\pi(s)}\\left[G\\right]$, and $W_1$ metric satisfies \n\n$W_1(\\mu,\\nu)=\\sup_{f\\colon Lip(f) \\leq 1} \\|\\mathbb{E}[f(X)] -\\mathbb{E}[f(Y)] \\|$, where $X\\sim\\mu$ and $Y\\sim\\nu$,\n\nwe always have \n\n$ \\sup_{s}\\|\\widehat V^\\pi(s)-V^\\pi(s)\\|\\leq \\sup_{s}W_1(\\eta^\\pi(s),\\hat\\eta^\\pi(s))    $\n\nTherefore, any lower bound for the problem of standard policy evaluation would be a valid lower bound for the problem we consider.\nSince $\\widetilde{\\Omega}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2 (1-\\gamma)^3}\\right)$ is a lower bound for the standard policy evaluation (see [Pananjady and Wainwright,\n2020], Theorem 2(b)), it is also a lower bound for our problem.\nTherefore, the $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2 (1-\\gamma)^3}\\right)$ upper bound we show matches the lower bound (up to logarithmic factors) and is thus near-minimax-optimal.\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude for your inquiry. We will revise the manuscript to clarify this point and ensure that our exposition is as precise and understandable as possible.\n\n> Limitations: Some assumptions ... minimax optimal.\n\nWe believe that we have clearly stated the theoretical assumptions in the main text, and the points made by other reviewers: ""This paper is very technically precise"" (bMoZ) and ""The paper clarifies the limitations by making assumptions for theoretical explanations"" (CFYY) also support this view.\nWe would be grateful if the reviewer could specify which assumptions have not been explicitly stated, as this would greatly assist us in enhancing the quality of our work.\nThe topic of minimax-optimality has already been discussed in our response to the questions part. \n\n## References\nMohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, R´emi Munos, and Hilbert J Kappen.

Unlike approaches that extend or search for rationales, DeAR is featured by 1) adopting a tree-based question decomposition manner to plan the organization of rationales, which mimics the logical planning inherentin human cognition; 2) globally updating the rationales at each reasoning step through natural language feedback. Specifically, the Decompose stage decomposes the question into simpler sub-questions, storing them as new nodes; the Analyze stage generates and self-checks rationales for sub-questions at each node evel; and the Rethink stage updates parent-node rationales based on feedback from their child nodes. By generating and updating the reasoning process from a more global perspective, DeAR constructs more adaptive and accurate logical structures for complex problems, facilitating timely error correction compared to rationale-extension and search-based approaches such as Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) and Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). We conduct extensive experiments on three reasoning benchmarks, including ScienceQA, StrategyQA, and GSM8K, which cover a variety of reasoning tasks, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces logical errors and enhances performance across various LLMs. Furthermore, we validate that DeAR is an efficient method that achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and reasoning time compared to ToT and GoT.",Oral Session 3B: Natural Language Processing,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=NPKZF1WDjZ,https://openreview.net/forum?id=NPKZF1WDjZ,NPKZF1WDjZ,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'In order to solve intricate reasoning problems, this study introduces the paradigm of\xa0 Decompose-Analyze-Rethink (DeAr) cycles for Large Language Models.

As for your concerns:\n\n**Q1**: Question decomposition examples.\n\n**A1**: Thanks for your insightful comments. In our approach, the logic heuristics provided in the problem decomposition prompt vary dynamically depending on the question. The logic heuristics presented in Table 5 are specific to a particular case of a question. For a given question, we select problem decomposition examples from the demonstration pool based on the calculated cosine similarity. Different examples may be selected as part of the prompt for different questions (see Appendix B.1 for a detailed description). This method can effectively adjust the prompt according to the differences in questions, allowing for better decomposition tailored to the characteristics of each problem compared to a fixed prompt.\n\n**Q2**: Using LLMs for answer scoring.\n\n**A2**: Thanks for your valuable comments. In section 4.2, line 217, we mentioned that scoring for the answer could also be achieved using other voting or classification methods. In the ToT method, a comparison was made between ""value"" and ""vote"" scoring approaches, demonstrating that both are effective for verifying the accuracy of answers[1]. In our paper, for simplicity, we explored the method of directly generating scores using the backbone LLMs , and we will supplement the results obtained using voting in the future.\n\n[1] Tree of thoughts: Deliberate problem solving with large language models.\n\n**Q3**: An ablation study about Decompose Stage.\n\n**A3**: Thanks for your insightful comments. Given that each stage in our method is essential for constructing the reasoning tree, it is challenging to perform an ablation study by simply removing one stage. If we were to conduct an ablation study that eliminates the decompose stage, then the subsequent analyze and rethink stages would be hindered, because these stages rely on analyzing and updating the sub-questions that result from the decomposition process. A possible way to validate the effectiveness of the decompose stage is to replace its prompt with prompts from other methods, such as those used for problem decomposition in the Least-to-Most approach. In the table below, we have included supplementary comparative experiments on ScienceQA that demonstrate the superiority of our designed decompose stage. As shown in the table, the performance will decline after we replace our prompt with Least-to-Most decomposition prompt, indicating the effectiveness of our method. We will consider designing additional experiments to further validate the effectiveness of different stages.\n\n|  | DeAR+GPT3.5| DeAR+GPT3.5 (Least-to-Most decomposition prompt)|\n|  ----  | ---- | ---- |\n|Accs on ScienceQA |83.68 | 81.33 |\n\n**Q4**: Typos and grammatical problems.\n\n**A4**: Thanks for your suggestions, we will correct these errors in the revised version.\n\n**Q5**: Human cognitive reasoning discussion.\n\n**A5**: Thank you for your insightful comments and for raising a philosophical consideration regarding the comparison between ANNs and human cognition. Regarding the human cognitive reasoning discussion in our paper, we included it with the intention of drawing parallels to human problem-solving strategies, like the decompose, analyze and rethink stages, which can provide intuitive understanding and potentially guide the development of more natural and effective AI systems. \n\n**Q6**: The first question example in B1.\n\n**A6**: Thank you for your comments. For each question, we employ cosine similarity to select the most semantically similar questions from the demonstration pool to construct decomposition examples. For instance, regarding the original question ""Does the actress who played Elizabeth II speak fluent Arabic?"", the questions chosen from the demonstration pool are ""Will Queen Elizabeth be buried in the Pantheon?"", ""Was Elizabeth II the Queen during the Persian Gulf War?"", and ""Does Elizabeth II reign over the Balearic Islands?"". These selected questions and their decomposition examples might contain additional information.

We have provided a detailed explanation for the obtaining of question decomposition demonstrations and examples of prompts for the Decomposition Stage in **Appendix B.1**. We use a BERT encoder to transform target question Q and human-annotated question decomposition demonstrations into vector representations. Then we use cosine similarity to select the top K (K=3 in our setting) similar demonstrations as logic heuristics.\n\n**Q2**:  Lacking further discussion or evaluations on question decomposition.\n\n**A2**: Thank you for your insightful comments. Other methods that use question decomposition to solve complex problems typically decompose the original question into sub-questions through a simple prompting method and then solve them step by step, such as the least-to-most approach. In contrast, the DeAR framework we propose not only uses logic heuristics during the **Decompose** stage to enhance the logic of the question decomposition but also provides more refined planning and updating of the problem-solving process during the **Analyze** and **Rethink** stages. This further ensures the reliability of the problem-solving process, preventing the spread of errors. Additionally, the reasoning tree generated by DeAR makes the reasoning process more interpretable.\n\n**Q3**:  The effectiveness of the “self-check” mechanism is not well evaluated.\n\n**A3**: Thank you for your insightful comments.

The construction process of our proposed reasoning tree is such that the three stages—decompose, analyze, and rethink—are indispensable. If we conduct a ablation study that omits one of these stages, for example, removing the decompose stage, then both the analyze stage and the rethink stage would be unable to proceed, as the latter two stages must analyze and update the sub-problems generated from the decomposition. Similarly, eliminating the analyze stage would result in the inability to obtain the rationales for each node, thereby preventing the rethink stage from taking place. Removing the rethink stage would also render the first two stages pointless; the entire framework would then devolve into using a zero-shot approach to directly solve the problem at the root node and obtain the result.\n\nHere, the only part where an ablation study can be reasonably conducted is the self-check method within the analyze stage, as removing self-check will not structurally affect the other two stages. Therefore, we have added an ablation study on the self-check method using the ScienceQA dataset, as shown in the table below. It can be observed that, based on different LLM backbones, DeAR consistently performs better than DeAR without self-check, which also proves the effectiveness of the self-check method. We will include this experiment in the updated version.\n\n|     |     | ScienceQA|      |   \n|  ----  | ---- | ---- |  ----  | \n|     | GPT3.5|LLaMA2-7B|ChatGLM3-6B|\n|**DeAR w/o self-check**| 82.76 | 69.44  | 50.35 | \n|**DeAR**| 83.68  | 70.57  | 51.08  | \n\n**Q2**: Human evaluations.\n\n**A2**: Thank you for your comments. We have adopted some approaches to help minimize the bias of annotators towards rationales of varying lengths. For example, we provided each annotator with detailed annotation instructions, allowing them to select the most logical response from the answers given by different models, as shown in Figure 6, Appendix C.2. At the same time, we performed multiple random samplings from the dataset, each time with a different set of annotators, to further prevent the unreliability of results due to the subjective factors of individual annotators. We have five annotators, which is a similar number to that used in other studies employing human evaluation methods, such as in [1]. We will include more details about the sampling and annotation process in the updated version.\n\n[1] Guiding Mathematical Reasoning via Mastering Commonsense Formula Knowledge\n\n\n**Q3**: The values for threshold hyperparameters.\n\n**A3**: Thank you for your insightful comments. We set the thresholds by conducting the threshold combination experiment in Section 5.6. We selected the threshold combination that yields the highest reasoning accuracy for our configuration.\n\n**Q4**: Typo about table’s name: Table 3 should be Tabel 4.\n\n**A4**: Thank you for the reminder, we will correct it in the updated version.\n\n**Q5**: How large is the demonstration pool?\n\n**A5**: For the ScienceQA dataset, we randomly selected some questions from each topic in the training set and annotated 500 examples as a demonstration pool. For GSM8K and StrategyQA, since their training sets already have annotations for problem decomposition, we directly chose 500 items from them as the demonstration pool. We will include this in the updated version.\n\n**Q6**: I notice that the authors employ a cosine similarity-based strategy to pick appropriate demonstrations when constructing prompts at the Decompose stage, is the same strategy used to test the performance of the baseline prompting methods?\n\n**A6**: Thank you for your question.  Selecting demonstrations for problem decomposition prompts will only be effective for methods that include a problem decomposition step. Among the baselines in this experiment, only the least-to-most method includes a problem decomposition step. Therefore, for least-to-most, we use the same demonstration pool and cosine similarity selection method as DeAR. As for other baselines, such as CoT, ToT, GoT, since they do not include a problem decomposition step, naturally we do not select decomposition demonstrations for prompting.\n\n**Q7**: How to assign the proper values if there is no validation set available?\n\n**A7**: Thank you for your question. A portion of the data from the training set can be selected as a validation set to verify the effects of different threshold combinations, and the optimal combination can be chosen for testing on the test set.'}}, 'id': '2tHr1TIQkf', 'forum': 'NPKZF1WDjZ', 'replyto': 'hkWetrRu7c', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8833/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8833/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8833/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722950000715, 'cdate': 1722950000715, 'tmdate': 1730882049708, 'mdate': 1730882049708, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We appreciate your acknowledgement of on our study motivation, model design, experimental results, and presentation. Your suggestions are insightful for us.\n\n**Q1**:  The effectiveness of the “self-check” method in “Analyze Stage” may need further validation. \n\n**A1**: Thank you for your insightful comments. Here, we add an ablation study focusing on the self-check mechanism, utilizing the ScienceQA dataset for our analysis, as illustrated in the table below. The results demonstrate that across three LLM backbones, the DeAR model outperforms its counterpart without the self-check method, thereby validating the self-check method\'s efficacy. Although other methods that employ LLMs for self-correction may not be sufficiently effective, our experiments have demonstrated that incorporating a self-check method during the Analyze stage is very necessary. We intend to incorporate these findings into the updated version of our work.\n\n|     |     | ScienceQA|      |   \n|  ----  | ---- | ---- |  ----  | \n|     | GPT3.5|LLaMA2-7B|ChatGLM3-6B|\n|**DeAR w/o self-check**| 82.76 | 69.44  | 50.35 | \n|**DeAR**| 83.68  | 70.57  | 51.08  | \n\n**Q2**: More detailed explanation of case studies.\n\n**A2**: Yes. We\'ll break down how DeAR enhances the reasoning process with a real example from Figure 9 in Appendix C.4. Imagine we need to solve a comparison question, ""#2"": ""Who is younger between these two directors?"" In the **Decompose** stage, DeAR breaks ""#2"" into simpler sub-questions, ""#3"" and ""#4"", asking for the ages of the directors of ""Zakhm"" and ""Telefono Rosso,"" which are more manageable for Large Language Models (LLMs) to figure out.\nOnce we have the answers to these sub-questions, DeAR moves on to the **Analyze** stage. Here, it not only gets the specifics but also spots and fixes a mistake: it corrects the age of Mahesh Bhatt from 70, born in 1954, to the accurate 76 years old, born in 1948. With the correct information in hand, in **Rethink stage**, DeAR then revisits the original question and makes the necessary update, correcting the initial guess of ""Mahesh Bhatt"" to the right answer, ""Nanni Moretti.""\nThis step-by-step approach allows DeAR to catch and correct any faulty reasoning along the way, stopping errors from spreading. In the next version of our work, we\'ll add more such detailed examples to paint a clearer picture.\n\n**Q3**: Is the method effective for more complex tasks? \n\n**A3**: Thank you for your comments. We conduct further experiments based on GPT-4, particularly on the more challenging MATH dataset, to address your inquiry. The results are presented in the table below. For more complicated questions in MATH, DeAR also performs better.\n\n| Methods (with GPT-4 backbone) | ACCs on MATH | \n|  ----  | ---- |\n|CoT     | 56.99  |\n|CoT+SC **[1]** (sample 5 solutions each time)  | 57.24  |\n|ToT     | 57.18   | \n|ToT-variant **[2]** | 57.02  |\n|GoT     | 58.78  |      \n|DeAR    | **62.25**  | \n\n**[1]** Self-consistency improves chain of thought reasoning in language models.\n\n**[2]** Large language model guided tree-of-thought. \n\n**Q4**: Could the authors provide a more detailed efficiency analysis based on GPT-3.5? \n\n**A4**: Yes. On the ScienceQA dataset, using GPT3.5 as backbone, to ensure a fair comparison, we compare DeAR (with parameters b=1.58 and d=3.62) with ToT, which has the closest values for branch b and depth d (b=3, d=4). We\'ve looked at the average number of API calls for each question, and ACCs on test set, as shown in the table below. It\'s clear that our method makes fewer API calls on average, which means less time under the same conditions, and achieves higher ACCs at the same time.

First, to answer the comparison question “#2”: Which of these two directors has a smaller age?”, our framework decomposes it into sub-questions “#3”: What is the age of Zakhm’s director?” and “#4”: What is the age of Telefono Rosso’s director?”, which are easier for LLMs to solve. Second, in the Analyze stage, DeAR obtains the answers of sub-question #3 and #4, and also corrects the wrong answer “Mahesh Bhatt was born in 1954, he is 70 years old now” to the right one “Mahesh Bhatt was born in 1948, he is 76 years old now”. After that, the corrected answer to #3 is used to update the answer of #2, and corrects #2’s answer “Mahesh Bhatt” to “Nanni Moretti”. Through the above process, DeAR is able to help correct wrong reasoning steps and avoid error propagation, which is crucial in enhancing model’s reasoning ability. We will include more detailed cases in the revised version.\n\n**Q4**: Does the method work with stronger LLMs? \n\n**A4**: Thank you for your insightful comments and valuable feedback. In response to your interest, we have conducted further experiments using the GPT-4 backbone to robustly illustrate the effectiveness of our DeAR framework.

On the MATH dataset, a comprehensive benchmark that challenges models with a variety of mathematical reasoning tasks, DeAR has demonstrated superior performance compared to different SOTA methods, including CoT, CoT-SC, ToT, a variant of ToT, and GoT. \n\n**[1]** Self-consistency improves chain of thought reasoning in language models.\n\n**[2]** Large language model guided tree-of-thought.'}}, 'id': 'H15mEdnVUS', 'forum': 'NPKZF1WDjZ', 'replyto': 'TPkxe1XuO2', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8833/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8833/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8833/Official_Review5/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722947391246, 'cdate': 1722947391246, 'tmdate': 1730882049673, 'mdate': 1730882049673, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We sincerely thank all reviewers’ efforts in reviewing our paper.

This step can probably itself be improved by different prompting strategies. In B1, I was indeed surprised by the first decomposition example. It seems to me that there is nothing that suggests that the Pantheon is a Mausoleum or that it is reserved for citicens of a particular country. It seems to me that the example is much more than just a decomposition as it involves a lot of Background Knowledge that may or may not be available. The second and third example seem much more natural.\n- another problem is evaluating the answers. It seems very naive to ask the LLM for a score. While some People claim that LLMs can give meaningful quantitative evaluations, there is also a lot of evidence to the contrary. Given the nature of LLMs, it seems to me that there is a good chance that the LLM will just return a score that frequently occured in ""similar contexts"" during training and is not particularly meaningful.

A neuron in an ANN is just a numerical parameter, a human neuron is a biological cell, which can itself be seen as a primitive life form with its own metabolism. Perhaps something intelligent will evolve from ANNs, but comparing them to biological NNs seems rather far-fetched to me. I appreciate that the paper does not really go into that direction, but does the whole human cognitive reasoning discussion really add anything to the paper? I agree that the proposed approach is more natural than other prompting approaches, but does it really resemble what humans do?

Specifically, the _Decompose_ stage decomposes the question into simpler sub-questions, storing them as new nodes; the _Analyze_ stage generates and self-checks rationales for sub-questions at each node evel; and the _Rethink_ stage updates parent-node rationales based on feedback from their child nodes. By generating and updating the reasoning process from a more global perspective, DeAR constructs more adaptive and accurate logical structures for complex problems, facilitating timely error correction compared to rationale-extension and search-based approaches such as Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) and Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). We conduct extensive experiments on three reasoning benchmarks, including ScienceQA, StrategyQA, and GSM8K, which cover a variety of reasoning tasks, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces logical errors and enhances performance across various LLMs. Furthermore, we validate that DeAR is an efficient method that achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and reasoning time compared to ToT and GoT.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'natural_language_processing'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/acb2a9d4f574358366be48733d2d875403731798.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\nxue2024decompose,\ntitle={Decompose, Analyze and Rethink: Solving Intricate Problems with Human-like Reasoning Cycle},\nauthor={Shangzi Xue and Zhenya Huang and Jiayu Liu and Xin Lin and Yuting Ning and Binbin Jin and Xin Li and Qi Liu},\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=NPKZF1WDjZ}\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'xue|decompose_analyze_and_rethink_solving_intricate_problems_with_humanlike_reasoning_cycle'}}, 'id': 'NPKZF1WDjZ', 'forum': 'NPKZF1WDjZ', 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8833/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8833/Authors'], 'number': 8833, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8833/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8833/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1715670323189, 'cdate': 1715670323189, 'tmdate': 1736847267940, 'mdate': 1736847267940, 'pdate': 1727287892292, 'odate': 1730873915535, 'version': 2}]"

The core innovations include a diffusion-based holistic facial dynamics and head movement generation model that works in a face latent space, and the development of such an expressive and disentangled face latent space using videos.Through extensive experiments including evaluation on a set of new metrics, we show that our method significantly outperforms previous methods along various dimensions comprehensively.

After filtering out invalid or low-quality videos, we ended up with approximately 170K training clips.\n\n**Response to W3 (OneMin-32 data details):** It contains 32 one-minute video clips of 17 subjects (Line 229-232). They are mostly educational lectures and coaching sessions sourced from online video sharing platforms. The resolution is 512x512.\n\n**Response to W4 (training time):** Our face latent model (encoder and decoder) takes around 7 days\' training on a 4xA6000 workstation, and the diffusion transformer takes ~3 days. The total data used for training is ~500k clips (about 2-10 seconds each).\n\n**Response to W5 (condition usage):**  Yes, the condition signals are simply concatenated with noise along the temporal dimension as the input to the transformer. We\'ll clarify this in the paper.\n\n**Response to W6 (change to [2]):**  Our latent model architecture is same to [2]. We did not change the architecture but modified the training loss functions (Line 149-160) which are critical to achieve disentanglement (Figure A.8 and Line 344-350).\n\n**Response to W7 (data scale ablation):**  As mentioned above, our data size is ~500K (not *"">10e6""*). In the attached one-page PDF, we add a data size ablation study and comparison with other methods, as per the reviewer\'s suggestion. We trained a model using only 10% of the data (i.e., 50k clips). As shown in Table I, this model achieve comparable audio-lip and audio-pose synchronization to the full-data model, though the FVD and $\\Delta$p metrics are not as good. This shows that our method performs well even with much less data, and more data enhances the motion diversity. Moreover, it still significantly outperforms other methods in all metrics assessing synchronization, motion intensity, and video quality.\n\n**Response to W8 (novelty):**  *First*, our motivation in the first place is, to model the human conversational behavior (facial dynamics and head movement ) *holistically using diffusion model* in a latent space that is agnostic to ID and appearance. This is our core innovation and, to the best of our knowledge, no previous methods have done this (it differs from the trend of further factor disentanglement and direct image generation; see our discussion in Line 47-55, 103-111). *Second*, in pursuit of the aforementioned goal, we did find the 3D-aided representation to be promising especially in terms of expressiveness and hence chose to leverage them. However, they can NOT meet our requirement of effective disentanglement. We made some insightful and provably critical modifications (Line 149-160, 344-350, and Figure A.8), without which we can never reach the current generation quality, esp. the liveliness with nuanced emotions. We perhaps have underemphasized the importance and contribution of such modifications, and will revise our presentation in the revision. \n\nApart from the two main contributions, our paper also offers other ones such as the design of face-factor-conditioned diffusion training, the CAPP model for filling the missing piece of pose-audio alignment metric, etc., which are also novel and valuable to the community.\n\n**Response to W9 (limited comparison to sota?):** To the best of our knowledge, there are no other published methods which can generate both audio-driven head poses and facial movements with single images. We mentioned some concurrent unpublished works in our paper, and have added the visual comparison with a concurrent work EMO in the one-page PDF. We\'d appreciate it if the reviewer can point out some specific papers that we should compare with. \n\nRegarding the added comparison with EMO, we provide our results on some samples from EMO\'s official website (we are unable to provide video links per the rebuttal policy). As shown in Figure I, our method works consistently well and delivers vivid talking head videos. It is obvious that EMO has smaller head motion compared to us. Also, EMO seems less robust than ours in some cases, with artifacts – such as abrupt expression change, inaccurate lip sync, and subtle texture detail flickering – occasionally appear upon close inspection (note that their reported average lip-sync score is significantly lower than ours). On the other hand, however, EMO\'s video quality is slightly higher than ours in terms of sharpness, owing to their use of the large and powerful image generation foundation model.\n\n**Response to W10 (FVD on Voxceleb2) :** As shown in Table I of the attached PDF, we provide the FVD scores of different methods on Voxceleb2. However, it should be noted that the video quality of Voxceleb2 varies widely and is often low (see Figure II of the PDF). Hence the FVD score may not accurately reflect the true generation quality, as mentioned in our paper.\n\n**Response to W11 (gaze estimation) :**  Thanks for your careful reading. We found that we inadvertently cited the wrong paper: we actually used L2CS-Net [a] to extract gaze direction. Will fix this error in our revised paper.\n\n[a] Ahmed A.Abdelrahman, Thorsten Hempel, Aly Khalifa and Ayoub Al-Hamadi, L2CS-Net: Fine-Grained Gaze Estimation in Unconstrained Environments, 2022\n\n**Response to Q1:** The results of different methods are resized to the same resolution (224x224) for FVD evaluation.\n\n**Response to Q2:** This is an interesting question. For now we did not conduct in-depth analysis on whether the CAPP score captures the semantic relationship between speech and pose.

Also note that we will soon release the CAPP model, which we believe fills the missing piece of audio-pose alignment metric in talking face generation research and will be valuable to the community.\n\n**Response to Q2:** EMO is a concurrent work (published Feb 27th on arXiv) at the time of our submission (May 22th) and there's no public implementation, so we did not compare with it. However, we did mention it with some discussions in our paper (Line 41-44, 115-118). EMO uses an image diffusion model based on StableDiffusion to generate talking face videos, which is a significantly different technique. It can generate high-quality videos but suffers from heavy computation and slow generation speed compared to ours. \n\nIn the attached one-page PDF, we provide our results including animations on some samples from EMO's official website (we are unable to provide video links per the rebuttal policy). As shown in Figure I, our method works consistently well on EMO's demonstrated cases and delivers vivid talking head videos. It is obvious that EMO has smaller head motion compared to ours, perhaps due to the constraint of the face region mask used by it. Also, EMO seems less robust than ours in some cases, with artifacts – such as abrupt expression change, inaccurate lip sync, and subtle texture detail flickering – occasionally appears upon close inspection (note that their reported average lip-sync score is significantly lower than ours). On the other hand, however, EMO's video quality is slightly higher than ours in terms of sharpness, owing to their use of the large and powerful image generation foundation model.\n\n**Response to Limitations:** Thank you for the comments. We plan to handle upper-body/full-body and explore more explicit 3D representations in our future work (both projects are on-going).\n\n---\n\nWe hope we have addressed your questions. If not, it would be great to let us further know your concerns during discussion.""}}, 'id': 'Tjmkyddkd7', 'forum': '5zSCSE0k41', 'replyto': 'c8ZtI9Buqz', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9714/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9714/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9714/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723010392110, 'cdate': 1723010392110, 'tmdate': 1730882215727, 'mdate': 1730882215727, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""**Response to W1:** Thank you for the comment. We will add more details of the 3D-aided face latent model into our main paper and appendix. Our network architecture follows MegaPortraits [18] where details can be found. To achieve disentanglement, we modified the loss functions and incorporated the cross-transfer consistency loss $L_{consist}$ and ID-disentanglement loss $l_{cross-id}$. (Line 149-160). These loss modifications are critical (Line 344-350 and Figure A.8), without which we can never reach the current generation quality, esp. the liveliness with nuanced emotions. Again, we'll add more details and further improve the clarity as per your suggestion.\n\n**Response to W2:** Different conditional signals are directly concatenated with noise along the temporal dimension as the input to the transformer.\n\n**Response to W3:** First, please note that different methods in the literature may have used different data for training. We are unable to compare with these methods using exactly the same data and have simply followed the practice of running the trained models for comparison.\n\nIn terms of training data scale, our model is trained on ~500k clips (2-10 seconds each). To validate the data scale influence and compare it with previous methods at similar scales, we additionally trained a model using only 10% of the data (i.e., 50k clips). As shown in Table I in the attached PDF, the model trained with 10% of the data achieves comparable audio-lip and audio-pose synchronization to the full-dataset model, though the FVD and $\\Delta$p metrics are not as good. This shows that our method performs well even with much less data, and more data enhances the motion diversity.\n\nRegarding the compared methods, Audio2Head used >70k data clips for training but clearly underperformed compared to our model with 50k clips. MakeItTalk and SadTalker used very small subsets of Voxceleb for training, but there's no clear evidence that increasing their data would improve their performance significantly or even bring any positive consequence - we explain the reasons as follows. MakeItTalk uses an LSTM to map audio features to landmark offsets deterministically, which may struggle with modeling complex data distributions and one-to-many mappings as training data increases. SadTalker assigns a style code for each identity to generate head poses, but more data will introduce more diverse head motion patterns for the same identity, which a shallow VAE with a condition code might not be able to effectively model. Our model with 10% data still significantly outperforms these methods in all metrics assessing synchronization, motion intensity, and video quality.\n\n**Response to Q1:** We set the transformer layer number to 8 as we found it produces good results while enabling the whole algorithm to run in real time on a consumer-grade GPU. We didn't explore more layers or larger model size because real-time efficiency is a key factor we want to achieve. We presume that a larger model size will further improve the performance because our current model is still small, and we'll further explore this in our future work.\n\n**Response to Q2:** Yes, we will soon release the CAPP model, which we believe fills the missing piece of audio-pose alignment metric in talking face generation research and will be valuable to the community.\n\n**Response to Q3:** No, we did not use distillation or any other strategies to speed-up the 3D-aided face encoder and decoder. These models are naturally small and run very fast. Note we only need to run the encoder once so essentially only the decoder needs to run for generating each video frame.\n\n**Response to Q4:** The parameter counts of our 3D-aided face latent model and diffusion transformer model are about 200M and 29M respectively.\n\n---\n\nWe hope we have addressed your questions. If not, it would be great to let us further know your concerns during discussion.""}}, 'id': 'RreQ8zgD1E', 'forum': '5zSCSE0k41', 'replyto': 'jY9V0mUZuX', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9714/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9714/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission9714/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722964036604, 'cdate': 1722964036604, 'tmdate': 1730882215759, 'mdate': 1730882215759, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We sincerely thank all reviewers for the valuable comments and suggestions.

In response to your question on our technical contributions and relationship with MegaPortraits, we'd like to emphasize two aspects. **First**, our motivation in the first place is to model the human face conversational behavior (facial dynamics and head movement) *holistically using a diffusion model*, in a latent space that is agnostic to ID and appearance. This is our core innovation and, to the best of our knowledge, no previous methods have done this (it differs from the trends of further factor disentanglement and direct image generation; see our discussion in Lines 47-55, 103-111). **Second**, in pursuit of the aforementioned goal and building a disentangled latent space, we did find the 3D-aided representation to be promising especially in terms of expressiveness and hence chose to leverage them. However, they can NOT meet our requirement of effective disentanglement. We made some insightful and provably critical modifications (Line 149-160, 344-350, and Figure A.8), without which we can never reach the current generation quality, esp. the liveliness with nuanced emotions. We perhaps have underemphasized the importance and contribution of such modifications, and will revise our presentation in the revision. \n\nApart from the two main technical contributions, our paper also offers other ones such as the design of face-factor-conditioned diffusion training, the CAPP model for filling the missing piece of pose-audio alignment evaluation, etc., which are also novel and valuable to the community.\n\n**Response to Q1:** The extra condition signals such as the main eye gaze direction and head-to-camera distance are optional and they are provided by users. If not given, we can either set them to some default parameters  (e.g., a forward-looking eye gaze and the average head-to-camera distance of the training data; see Line 220-222), or just leave them blank for unconditional generation.\n\n**Response to Q2:** Thank you for the suggestion. We have run our method on the images and audios from EMO's official website as per your suggestion. Some visual results including animations can be found in the one-page PDF provided on this page (we are unable to provide video links per the rebuttal policy).

"['Tianhong Li', 'Dina Katabi', 'Kaiming He']",NeurIPS,Return of Unconditional Generation_ A Self-supervised Representation Generation Method,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97963,2024," Unconditional generation -- the problem of modeling data distribution without relying on human-annotated labels -- is a long-standing and fundamental challenge in generative models, creating a potential of learning from large-scale unlabeled data. In the literature, the generation quality of an unconditional method has been much worse than that of its conditional counterpart. This gap can be attributed to the lack of semantic information provided by labels. In this work, we show that one can close this gap by generating semantic representations in the representation space produced by a self-supervised encoder. These representations can be used to condition the image generator. This framework, called Representation-Conditioned Generation (RCG), provides an effective solution to the unconditional generation problem without using labels. Through comprehensive experiments, we observe that RCG significantly improves unconditional generation quality: e.g., it achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 2.15 on ImageNet 256x256, largely reducing the previous best of 5.91 by a relative 64%. Our unconditional results are situated in the same tier as the leading class-conditional ones. We hope these encouraging observations will attract the community's attention to the fundamental problem of unconditional generation. Code is available at https://github.com/LTH14/rcg .",Oral Session 3A: Generative Models,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=clTa4JFBML,https://openreview.net/forum?id=clTa4JFBML,clTa4JFBML,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Latent variables with non-collapsing posteriors'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Just think of the representation space of the MoCo encoder as a latent space and the diffusion model trained over this space as a prior over the latents. You can induce a reasonable posterior distribution over a finite sample of these latents using the softmax formed by scaled cos sim between the MoCo representation for an input image X and a finite sample of representations generated by the diffusion-based prior over MoCo representations. You can sample a generated representation based on that softmax and use it to condition generation of X. You could also play around with, eg, varying the temperature of the softmax in order to limit the information capacity of the latent variable (higher softmax entropy means less info about X). We can think of the softmax in contrastive learning, when evaluated only over negative samples, as estimating a conditional distribution over a non-parametric dictionary of representations that assigns higher probability to representations which are most similar to the representation of the ""positive sample"". This conditional should work reasonably well for sampling ""semantic"" information about X to use in conditioning. This also avoids a train/test mismatch in the representations used for conditioning the decoder, since they\'re always samples from the prior.\n\nApproaches like the one described above decouple decisions about what information to cram in a latent variable and how to decode that information to produce a generated image. In the olden days, with deep VAEs and such, there were often issues with ""posterior collapse"" when adding a more powerful decoder p(x|z). Basically, z would be ignored since the model for p(x|z) was powerful enough to just act like p(x) without much impact on the training likelihoods. In the ""representation conditioned"" setting described above, we can decide what information should be in the latent variable (eg, whatever MoCo happens to capture), and how much information to condition on when generating X. In the setup described above, the amount of info about X is limited to the log of the number of prior samples in the contrastive softmax minus the entropy of the contrastive softmax. This lets us define a nice latent space and non-collapsing posteriors over that latent space which represent strictly controlled amounts of ""semantic"" information which can guide data generation.\n\nI also think this setup would work fine without the diffusion model over MoCo representations. You could probably get away with just defining the prior as uniform over the appropriate hypersphere. This would make training and sampling a bit quicker. It\'s also straightforward to extend this approach to hierarchical latents, latents with variable bandwidth, etc.'}}, 'id': 'ZnrqtxDMhY', 'forum': 'clTa4JFBML', 'replyto': 'lMLRzuqeJz', 'signatures': ['~Philip_Bachman1'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', '~Philip_Bachman1'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3478/-/Public_Comment'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1732301294284, 'cdate': 1732301294284, 'tmdate': 1732301294284, 'mdate': 1732301294284, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'This paper addresses the problem of unconditional image generation using latent representations.

Below we address the weaknesses (***W***) and questions (***Q***) raised by the reviewer. We hope the reviewer could consider raising the score given the additional evaluation in feature generation and the interpretation of the ablation results provided in the rebuttal.\n\n***Technical novelty (W1)***\n\nAs emphasized in the general response, one major technical contribution of this work is the representation generator. Unlike previous works such as [5, A] ([48] not related to image generation) which require ground-truth images to provide the representation during the generative process, our approach does not rely on such impractical requirements and demonstrates the possibility of unconditionally generating pre-trained self-supervised representations.\n\n***Additional evaluation of feature generation (Q1, Q2)***\n\nAs per the reviewer’s request, below we provide the reference points for FD and RCG’s performance using representations sampled from training images.\n\n***Q1: Reference points for FD***\n\nSince the MoCo v3 encoder is trained on the ImageNet training set, the representation distribution in the training set can be slightly different from that in the validation set. To establish a better reference point, we compute the FD between 50K randomly sampled representations from the training set and the representations from the entire training set, which should serve as the lower bound of the FD for our representation generator. The result is an FD of 0.38, demonstrating that our representation generator (with an FD of 0.48) can accurately model the representation distribution.\n\nWe also evaluate the representation generator against the validation set, resulting in an FD of 2.73. As a reference point, the FD between 50K randomly sampled representations from the training set and the validation set is 2.47, which is also close to the FD of our representation generator. We will include both results in the revision.\n\n***Q2: Performance using representations sampled from training images***\n\nIn Table 9(a), we evaluate our image generator under different conditions, including oracle representations from ImageNet training images. The oracle conditioning yields 4.37 FID and 149.0 IS, while conditioning on our generated representations achieves 5.07 FID and 142.5 IS. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of our representation generator in producing realistic and high-quality representations.\n\n***FID evaluation scheme (Q3)***\n\nFor FID in the main paper, we follow ADM’s evaluation suite which computes FID w.r.t. the ImageNet training set. This evaluation suite is widely adopted in prior works, so we need to follow it to make a fair comparison with them. Evaluating on the training set versus the validation set does not significantly change FID, and the ablation results trend remains consistent. To ensure consistency with the main paper, we will revise the FID results in the ablation section accordingly.\n\n***Interpretation of the ablation results (W2)***\n\nMost of the results in Tables 7-9 are standard hyper-parameter sweeps. Through these experiments, we aim to provide insights into which hyper-parameters are important and require tuning for future applications of our system.\n\nTwo results are particularly interesting: Table 9(a), which we have interpreted in our response to ***Q2***, and Table 7(a), which ablates different pre-trained encoders. We will explain the findings from Table 7(a) below.\n\n***MoCo v3 features vs. DINO/iBOT features (W2, Q4)***\n\nIn Table 7(a), using representations from MoCo v3 achieves better FID than using representations from DINO/iBOT. This is likely because only MoCo v3 uses an InfoNCE loss. Literature has shown that optimizing InfoNCE loss can maximize uniformity and preserve maximal information in the representation [1]. The more information in the representation, the more guidance it can provide for the image generator, leading to better and more diverse generation. To demonstrate this, we compute the uniformity loss on representations following section 4.1.2 from [1]. Lower uniformity loss indicates higher uniformity and more information in the representation. The uniformity loss of representations from MoCo v3, DINO, and iBOT is -3.94, -3.60, and -3.55, respectively, which aligns well with their generation performance. We will include this result and discussion in the revision.\n\n[1] Understanding Contrastive Representation Learning through Alignment and Uniformity on the Hypersphere\n\n***Generative models and self-supervised learning (W2, Q5)***\n\nWe thank the reviewer for initiating this discussion. The community has a long-standing belief in the synergy between self-supervised learning and generative models: good representations should enhance the generative process, and generative models can learn robust representations. As the reviewer mentioned, several papers have provided evidence supporting the latter. On the other hand, we focus on the former, showing that explicitly providing generated representations can significantly improve unconditional generative models, which also offers new and compelling evidence to support the synergy.\n\n***Limitations and negative societal impacts***\n\nApplying RCG to other data types is beyond this paper's scope and could be an interesting future direction. It requires a pre-trained encoder, typically available off-the-shelf for common data types. We will include this discussion in the revision.\n\nWe acknowledge that image datasets can contain various types of human bias, including biases in data collection and labeling. RCG's unsupervised nature could mitigate labeling bias as it does not rely on human-provided labels. However, we agree that this topic is beyond the paper’s scope and will refrain from making this claim in the revision. We will also include discussions on potential misuses.""}}, 'id': '7EYCAXiRH6', 'forum': 'clTa4JFBML', 'replyto': '4DcodCgqkG', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3478/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3478/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3478/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722987655765, 'cdate': 1722987655765, 'tmdate': 1730880956264, 'mdate': 1730880956264, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""We thank the reviewer for appreciating our clear writing and strong experiment results. Below we address the weaknesses (***W***) and questions (***Q***) raised by the reviewer.\n\n***Importance of the studied problem***\n\nWe respectfully disagree with the reviewer that “the studied problem has been well addressed in the community.” Unconditional image generation has lagged behind its conditional counterpart for a long time in the literature, especially on complex data distributions such as ImageNet. As shown in Table 2, none of the prior works achieve an unconditional generation FID less than 5 on ImageNet 256x256, and the previous state-of-the-art (RDM-IN) requires the ImageNet training set during generation to achieve a 5.91 FID. In contrast, as shown in Table 3, state-of-the-art class-conditional methods can easily achieve an FID around or below 2, demonstrating a significant gap between unconditional and class-conditional generation.\n\nOther reviewers have also acknowledged the difficulty and significance of the studied problem. Reviewer xRbx noted, “unconditional image generation has remained stagnant compared to conditional generation.” Reviewer zDRz stated, “the proposed method is designed to solve difficult problems very simply and intuitively.” Reviewer pEoh mentioned, “the paper shows very good and solid results on a relevant topic, touches upon the surface of very fundamental questions related to self-supervised methods and the training of generative models.”\n\nOur paper proposes a novel method based on generating self-supervised representations to address this long-standing open problem in the community. The proposed RCG framework significantly improves the quality of unconditional generation, regardless of the specific form of the image generator. It achieves an unprecedented unconditional generation FID of **2.15**, bridging the long-standing performance gap between unconditional and class-conditional generation methods for the first time. We hope the reviewer could reconsider the importance of the studied problem and the rating of our paper in light of this clarification.\n\n***Conditioning on instance representations (W1)***\n\nPrior methods for unconditional generation that use instance representations require ***existing images*** to provide representations during generation, which is impractical for many generative applications. Moreover, none of the prior works use a generative model to accurately model the pre-trained self-supervised representation distribution. Our RCG framework is the first unconditional generation framework that generates pre-trained self-supervised representations ***from scratch*** and uses them as conditions for the image generator. This novel approach significantly boosts unconditional generation performance and rivals class-conditional generation methods, all without the need for any images during the generation process.\n\n***Conditioning on clustering (W2)***\n\nWe agree that using pseudo-labels from clustering methods as class labels can be an option for unconditional generation. In fact, we have included this ablation study in Table 9(a), where we experimented with our image generator under different conditions, including clustering labels obtained from MoCo v3 representations. Conditioning on clustering labels achieves 6.60 FID and 121.9 IS, while conditioning on ground-truth class labels achieves 5.83 FID and 147.3 IS. Conditioning on our generated representations achieves 5.07 FID and 142.5 IS. These results demonstrate that clustering-based conditions perform worse than ground-truth class labels, whereas our generated representations can outperform ground-truth class labels. This is because the generated representations provide richer semantic information to guide the generative process. Furthermore, common clustering methods require the dataset to exhibit clear and distinct groupings or clusters that can be easily identified by clustering algorithms. It also limits the diversity of conditions, as it cannot produce different conditions within the same cluster. We will include this discussion in the revision.\n\n***Extending to class-conditional generation (Q1)***\n\nRCG seamlessly enables class-conditional image generation and achieves competitive performance, as shown in Table 3 (RCG, conditional (MAGE-L)). This is accomplished by training a class-conditional representation generator without the need to retrain or fine-tune the image generator. As shown in Table 11, training the RDM is very lightweight compared to training the image generator.\n\n***Limitations***\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Applying RCG to other data types is beyond this paper's scope and could be an interesting future direction. It requires a pre-trained encoder to extract representations from the data, which are typically available off-the-shelf for common data types such as images, videos, texts, and speech [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

This is likely because MoCo v3 uses an InfoNCE loss, which attracts positive samples and repels negative samples. Literature has shown that optimizing such an InfoNCE loss can maximize uniformity and preserve maximal information in the representation [1], thus providing substantial guidance for the image generator and leading to better and more diverse generation results.\n\nNonetheless, Table 7(a) also demonstrates that RCG achieves substantial improvements over the unconditional baseline using representations from various image encoders, including self-supervised encoders such as iBOT and DINO, as well as the supervised encoder DeiT.

This is because the image generator needs both the representation as a condition and the corresponding ground-truth image as supervision during training. For a representation output by the unconditional representation generator, it is challenging to determine the corresponding image. Therefore, if we were to use generated representations as conditions for our image generator, we wouldn’t have the corresponding ground-truth images needed for training. Additionally, our design allows us to fully decouple the training of the representation generator and the image generator, making our framework more flexible to train.\n\n***End-to-end training (Q2)***\n\nThis is an excellent suggestion. Training the representation generator and the image generator together could potentially further enhance the performance of the entire system. However, similar to ***Q1***, one possible issue is that the denoised representation output from the representation generator might not match the ground-truth representation and the corresponding ground-truth image, especially at high noise levels. In this scenario, using the denoised representation as the condition for the image generator while using the ground-truth image for supervision might cause inconsistencies during training.

Maybe showing FD between training and validation set could be an option, provided the number of samples for the estimates is handled carefully. Also, FD is evaluated on the training set. It would be good to have validation scores as well.\n\n- In a similar vein, I'd like to see the performance (FID) of RCG on features sampled from training images (similar to Figure 6). This would give another indication of how good the representation generation is. This is important since the representation generation is a major, and arguably the most important, contribution of the paper.\n\n- The authors mention in Appendix B that the FID in the corresponding section are computed on the validation set. Is that also the case for the other values in the main paper?\n\n- For the point raised in weakness b., a precise question I'd like to ask is why, as seen in Table 7a, MoCo v3 features are so much better for this task than DINO or iBOT features that are supposed to be better in other downstream tasks.\n\n- Also linked to weakness b., there are strong connections between generative models and self-supervised learning. In fact, works such as [61, A] or [41] on which the current paper builds a lot of their results are already generative models that explicitly double as representation learners, or even have representation learning as their main objective. Those ties should be discussed in the paper. \nMoreover, if a generative model can be a representation learner, and if using a representation can help achieve a better generative model, how to explain the good results in the submission becomes even less clear. I'd be happy to hear the authors' thoughts on that point.\n\nIn any case, I think the submission is already sound and of interest. It shows very good and solid results on a relevant topic, and opens up interesting research directions. But also, it doesn't provide much in terms of technical novelty or in terms of analysis. The paper touches upon, but barely scratches the surface of very fundamental questions related to self-supervised methods and the training of generative models.

This gap can be attributed to the lack of semantic information provided by labels. In this work, we show that one can close this gap by generating semantic representations in the representation space produced by a self-supervised encoder. These representations can be used to condition the image generator. This framework, called Representation-Conditioned Generation (RCG), provides an effective solution to the unconditional generation problem without using labels. Through comprehensive experiments, we observe that RCG significantly improves unconditional generation quality: e.g., it achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 2.15 on ImageNet 256x256, largely reducing the previous best of 5.91 by a relative 64%. Our unconditional results are situated in the same tier as the leading class-conditional ones.

Recent modeling work has attempted to understand the gap between models’ and humans’ data efficiency by constructing models trained on less data, especially multimodal naturalistic data. However, such models are often evaluated on adult-level benchmarks, with limited breadth in language abilities tested, and without direct comparison to behavioral data. We introduce DevBench, a multimodal benchmark comprising seven language evaluation tasks spanning the domains of lexical, syntactic, and semantic ability, with behavioral data from both children and adults. We evaluate a set of vision–language models on these tasks, comparing models and humans on their response patterns, not their absolute performance. Across tasks, models exhibit variation in their closeness to human response patterns, and models that perform better on a task also more closely resemble human behavioral responses. We also examine the developmental trajectory of OpenCLIP over training, finding that greater training results in closer approximations to adult response patterns. DevBench thus provides a benchmark for comparing models to human language development. These comparisons highlight ways in which model and human language learning processes diverge, providing insight into entry points for improving language models.",Oral Session 4A: Natural Language Processing,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10215,https://openreview.net/forum?id=zogaeVpbaE,zogaeVpbaE,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (Oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces DevBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal LMs on behavioral data from both children and adults.

Here, we highlight three key changes that we have made to our paper.\n\n**1. Repository availability**\n\nWe were previously working on licensing for some of our unpublished datasets, which have now been resolved; our GitHub repository is now live and can now be accessed at [github.com/alvinwmtan/dev-bench](https://www.github.com/alvinwmtan/dev-bench).\n\n**2. New baselines**\n\nWe have added a human baseline for tasks on which participant-level data were available (LWL, VV, TROG, VOC). To estimate this baseline, we randomly split the participants into two groups and calculated the between-group softmax-optimised KL divergence or RSA similarity as appropriate, repeating for 1000 random splits. We used the median result as a point estimate of the human baseline. The human baseline serves as a positive baseline for our tasks.\n\nWe also added a random baseline for all tasks, generated using a random initialisation of the OpenCLIP model. The random baseline serves as a negative baseline for our tasks.\n\nWe anticipate that the two baselines will assist in interpretation of the results, demonstrating the dynamic range that is possible for each task.\n\n**3. New models**\n\nWe also evaluated a set of newer models on our tasks to improve comprehensiveness. These models include SigLIP, as well as a set of conditional generation models (Kosmos-2, moondream2, TinyLLaVA, LLaVA, and CogVLM). The results for these models are presented in below.\n\nNotably, because the conditional generation models do not assign a similarity score between images and texts, we used an alternative method of evaluation: We passed in a text prompt of the format “Caption: {text}. Does the caption match the image? Answer either Yes or No.”, and we extracted logits for “Yes” and “No”. This prompt closely matched the actual human task for the Winoground dataset. We then subtracted the “No” logits from the “Yes” logits, which approximates the log odds ratio between “Yes” and “No” for each image; these logit differences were then used to calculate the softmax-optimised KL divergence. Note that there is as yet limited consensus for the best method to obtain image–text matching scores for conditional generation models; we intend to attempt alternative methods (namely, using a captioning task and getting logits for the texts, or asking for explicit matching ratings from 0–100) to understand how task construction affects model–human similarity. We also only evaluated the lexical and syntactic tasks for these models, since it was not always clear that pure image or text features (needed for the semantic tasks) were extractable from the models.\n\n| Model             | # params | # images | LWL (↓) | VV (↓) | TROG (↓) | WG (↓) | WAT (↓) | VOC (↑) | THINGS (↑) |\n|-------------------|----------|----------|---------|--------|----------|--------|---------|---------|------------|\n| SigLIP            | 800M     | 9B       | 0.067   | 0.612  | 0.888    | 0.258  | 0.495   | -0.028  | 0.192      |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| LLaVA             | 7B       | 1.31M    | 0.081   | 0.743  | 0.910    | 0.258  |         |         |            |\n| TinyLLaVA         | 3.1B     | 102K     | 0.033   | 0.230  | 0.410    | 0.202  |         |         |            |\n| Kosmos-2          | 1.6B     | 90M      | 0.064   | 0.743  | 0.905    | 0.258  |         |         |            |\n| moondream2        | 1.9B     | NA       | 0.062   | 0.713  | 0.757    | 0.254  |         |         |            |\n| CogVLM            | 17B      | 1.5B     | 0.079   | 0.685  | 0.868    | 0.237  |         |         |            |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| Human             |          |          | 0.010   | 0.091  | 0.028    |        |         | 0.251   |            |\n| Random (OpenCLIP) | 1.0B     | 0        | 0.087   | 0.740  | 0.908    | 0.258  | 0.495   | 0.246   | 0.054      |\n\nWe hope that these changes, as well as additional changes detailed in our replies below, will help to clarify and improve DevBench, making it more comprehensible, comprehensive, and useful for AI researchers and cognitive scientists alike.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': ""Thank you for your thoughtful remarks and suggestions, and we appreciate that you mentioned how our evaluation allows for better comparisons between models and humans.

Meanwhile, the model architectures are not fixed when comparing the performance - amount of training data / model size correlations. A better way might be using openCLIP intermediate checkpoints.**\n\nA1: We have now included some newer models including LLaVA; please see the general comment for more details.\n\nWe appreciate that model architectures were not fixed when conducting the model feature analysis; however, it is difficult to do so without doing additional training (as number of training steps may not match number of images seen, since images may be repeated across epochs). We agree that systematically evaluating the role of training data and model size is important, and have included it as a possible future direction:\n\n> It is important to note that our analyses of the relationship between model–human similarity and model features did not hold model architectures constant due to the limited availability of relevant model checkpoints which would have enabled such analyses. Systematic evaluation of the roles of training data and model size nonetheless remains an important research question for future work.\n\n**Q2: It's hard to interpret these results, especially the KL divergence-based measurements. For example, almost all the models score 0.494-0.495 on the WAT task (the WG task also behaves similarly); what does that mean? Are the models collapsing? I am also curious how well a random baseline would perform on these tasks.**\n\nA2: We added a human baseline for tasks on which we had participant-level data (LWL, VV, TROG, VOC), and also included a random baseline as a negative baseline; please see the general comment for more details. The WAT results are indeed more difficult to interpret; they may indicate that text embedding spaces are very similar across models—notably, WAT performance also remains relatively constant across OpenCLIP training, as shown in Figure 5.\n\n**Q3: There might be a lack of sufficient maintenance details.

I would like to read more if this is a novel idea or adopted from some work. Moreover, it would be good for the paper to also mention what method they used for calculating the (dis)similarity between human and model responses and how the KL divergence differs from their approach.**\n\nSoftmax-optimised KL divergence is a novel metric, although it is very closely related to ordinary KL divergence. We have added a section in the Appendix to explain how our metric differs from KL divergence.\n\n> We used the softmax-optimised KL divergence as our novel metric of model–human dissimilarity. (Ordinary) KL divergence reflects how different a target probability distribution is from a reference probability distribution, often considered the true distribution. In the case of DevBench, the reference distribution is obtained from human responses, while the target distribution is obtained from model responses. \n> \n> The typical method of deriving probabilities from model responses is by conducting a softmax over logits. However, we considered that model logits may not be calibrated to the same scale as human responses, and therefore included the temperature, $\\beta$, as a free parameter. In other words, the resultant distribution after optimisation can be considered a one-parameter projection from logit space to probability space, and the best fitting projection is that which induces the minimum KL divergence to the human response distribution.\n\n**Q3: The conclusion section is weak and can be improved. Discuss how the existence of the benchmark (as well as the release of some of the unpublished dataset component) paves way for new research directions in both ML and cognitive science as well as how it can be improved and developed by the open research community.**\n\nA3: Thanks for this invitation. Within our space constraints, we have added a bit more forward-looking text to this section, including moving some text downwards from the limitations section, as well as incorporating additional future directions: \n\n> **In particular, DevBench highlights the need for more fully open models with training checkpoints (Frank, 2024), enabling the study of training trajectories, as well as the need for more human-realistic training (Warstadt et al., 2023) to better characterise model–human correspondences across developmental change.

We respond to the review in detail below: \n\n**W1. While the benchmark is potentially interesting for building an empirical understanding of capacity and capabilities, the benchmark does not seem particularly relevant for evaluating frontier models, which are expected to be at ""adult"" level intelligence.**\n\nA1: Although it is true that the benchmark is primarily developmental in nature, we believe that there remain important reasons to benchmark frontier models:\n\n1. Some of our tasks (VV, WG, THINGS, WAT) were assessed on adults. Thus, there is direct comparability between frontier models and adult behaviour, and it is still important to understand model–human similarity for adults to understand gaps in model performance (see for example Section 5.3).\n\n2. Frontier models can also be evaluated in terms of their learning trajectories (much like our trajectory analysis in Section 5.2). Digging into model performance over the course of training gives us a better sense of how model and human learning processes may differ at a higher-order level, thereby suggesting ways in which model training (e.g., objectives, curricula) could be modified to increase similarity with human developmental trajectories.\n\n**W2.

We have made the repo accessible and all the data are contained there—the link should be live now.\n\n**W3. How is a logit evaluation applicable to the ""Lexicon: Looking-while-listening (LWL)"" evaluation, which is based on time?**\n\nA3: LWL data can be analysed in a number of ways, including time profile, reaction time, and accuracy (Fernald et al., 2008). Here we used the last metric, which is operationalised as the proportion of time that an infant spends looking at the target (rather than the distractor) during the critical window. This metric is interpreted as the probability with which the infant correctly identifies the target, in the same way that softmaxed logits represent the probability that the model correctly identifies the target.\n\n**W4. If the metric is always KL divergence as suggested in 3.2, why is higher sometimes better for certain task? The metrics don\'t seem to be super clear to me, perhaps make this more clear.**\n\nA4: As noted in Section 3.2, as well as the first paragraph of Section 4, KL divergence was used for the lexicon and syntax tasks as well as WAT, but VOC and THINGS were assessed using RSA similarity, for which higher scores reflect greater similarity. We clarified the wording slightly in Section 3.2 to emphasise this:\n\n> For the visual semantic tasks, we **instead** conducted human–model comparison by applying representational similarity analysis (RSA) on human and model representational similarity matrices, **which represents correlations in the representational geometries of humans and models.**\n\n**W5. Given the low computational cost of the benchmark, I suggest testing even more models, e.g., LLaVA models, SigLip models, DataComp models, etc.**\n\nA5: We have added SigLIP and LLaVA, along with a few other models; please see the general comment for more details.\n\n**W6. What is replacement stimuli?**\n\nA6: These are new stimuli that we had to replace because the originals did not have a sharable license. We added some text to clarify this:\n\n> Some images in the original stimuli set were not sharable due to license restrictions; in these cases, we used replacement stimuli matched for visual and semantic properties.\n\n**W7. Table 2 numbers are not super interpretable to me. What is the KL divergence between pairs of humans?

Image classification comes to mind. Hence, I suggest citing many more prior works, perhaps in an extended related work section. Additionally, Weihs et al. Benchmarking Progress to Infant-Level Physical Reasoning in AI. 2022. For the ""Model learning trajectory analyses"", consider adding references related to how downstream performance changes throughout a training trajectory.**\n\nA8: Thanks, we have added several related works, including the Weihs et al. reference given here.

For example: What are the inputs to OpenCLIP for TROG task and what are the outputs?**\n\nA1: Thanks for this comment. We have added more details on the evaluations in the Appendix:\n\n> For lexicon and syntax tasks, models were evaluated by passing in each image–text pair for each trial as inputs, and obtaining model logits for each pair. For LWL and WG, there were two images in each trial, while for VV and TROG, there were four images in each trial. Model logits were then used to calculate the softmax-optimised KL divergence with human responses.\n>\n> For VOC and THINGS, we obtained image embeddings for each stimulus, and obtained a representational similarity matrix (RSM) by calculating the pairwise cosine similarity for each pair of images. We then compared the model RSM with that obtained from human responses by calculating the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for entries below the main diagonal in model and human RSMs.\n>\n> For WAT, we obtained text embeddings for each stimulus, and calculated the pairwise cosine similarity for all cue–target pairs in the human response data. Model similarity values were then used to calculate the softmax-optimised KL divergence with human response distributions for each cue word.\n>\n> Some models (e.g., BridgeTower) always required both image and text inputs. For these models, we used an empty string as the dummy text input when obtaining image embeddings for VOC and THINGS, and we used a neutral gray square as the dummy image input when obtaining text embeddings for WAT.\n\n**Q2: Along the same line, a concern can be that these multi-modal models were trained on a different kind of data (e.g. CLIP was trained on pairs of image and image caption). This can lead to domain gap between the training data and the evaluation data (e.g. the visual encoder of these models might not be able to encode images with white background or with drawings well since they were trained on in-the-wild naturalistic images; or the language prompts they were trained on did not have the same format as the language prompts or responses expected for these tasks). Without careful mitigation of this domain gap, the performance of these models might degrade and become unreliable.**\n\nA2: This is an important comment, and it is true that model performance here likely represents a lower bound on model–human similarity. We have made an additional note in the limitations to acknowledge this:\n\n> Additionally, model performance in our evaluation setup may be affected by the domain gap between models’ training data and the stimuli used in our benchmark; for example, TROG uses cartoon depictions of events, which are dissimilar to the more photorealistic training data of CLIP. Thus, our evaluation results likely represent a lower bound on model–human similarity. It is nonetheless important to note that children as young as two years of age are able to learn from and generalise to pictographic depictions of objects (Ganea et al., 2008; Simcock & DeLoache, 2006; Tare et al., 2010), suggesting that generalisation across representations is an early-acquired skill.\n\n**Q3: Will the findings in the paper hold with the more advanced multi-modal models such as LLaVA (open-sourced), CogVLM (open-sourced), Kosmos-2 (open-sourced), GPT-4v, Gemini, etc.?

Recent modeling work has attempted to understand the gap between models’ and humans’ data efficiency by constructing models trained on less data, especially multimodal naturalistic data. However, such models are often evaluated on adult-level benchmarks, with limited breadth in language abilities tested, and without direct comparison to behavioral data. We introduce DevBench, a multimodal benchmark comprising seven language evaluation tasks spanning the domains of lexical, syntactic, and semantic ability, with behavioral data from both children and adults. We evaluate a set of vision–language models on these tasks, comparing models and humans on their response patterns, not their absolute performance. Across tasks, models exhibit variation in their closeness to human response patterns, and models that perform better on a task also more closely resemble human behavioral responses. We also examine the developmental trajectory of OpenCLIP over training, finding that greater training results in closer approximations to adult response patterns. DevBench thus provides a benchmark for comparing models to human language development. These comparisons highlight ways in which model and human language learning processes diverge, providing insight into entry points for improving language models.'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 Track Datasets and Benchmarks Oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Datasets_and_Benchmarks_Track'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/1a553222d812ac73e862ec1b54cb435d2fda7984.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\ntan2024devbench,\ntitle={DevBench: A multimodal developmental benchmark for language learning},\nauthor={Alvin Wei Ming Tan and Chunhua Yu and Bria Lorelle Long and Wanjing Anya Ma and Tonya Murray and Rebecca D.

"['Arjun Panickssery', 'Samuel Bowman', 'Shi Feng']",NeurIPS,LLM Evaluators Recognize and Favor Their Own Generations,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97998,2024," Self-evaluation using large language models (LLMs) has proven valuable not only in benchmarking but also methods like reward modeling, constitutional AI, and self-refinement. But new biases are introduced due to the same LLM acting as both the evaluator and the evaluatee. One such bias is self-preference, where an LLM evaluator scores its own outputs higher than others’ while human annotators consider them of equal quality. But do LLMs actually recognize their own outputs when they give those texts higher scores, or is it just a coincidence? In this paper, we investigate if self-recognition capability contributes to self-preference. We discover that, out of the box, LLMs such as GPT-4 and Llama 2 have non-trivial accuracy at distinguishing themselves from other LLMs and humans. By finetuning LLMs, we discover a linear correlation between self-recognition capability and the strength of self-preference bias; using controlled experiments, we show that the causal explanation resists straightforward confounders. We discuss how self-recognition can interfere with unbiased evaluations and AI safety more generally.",Oral Session 3C: Natural Language Processing,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=4NJBV6Wp0h,https://openreview.net/forum?id=4NJBV6Wp0h,4NJBV6Wp0h,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'I am very certain that this paper should be accepted and as it is the highest rated paper in my cohort I am recommending it for the highest level of acceptance which would be an oral presentation.

We'd like to address some concerns and questions brought up in the review.\n\n> Limitations of running the experiments on two summarization tasks\n\nWe agree that experimenting on more tasks is worthwhile and will update the paper once more experiments are completed. The following are our primary considerations for focusing on the two summarization tasks as the first step.\n\n1. Summarization is a representative testbed for self-evaluation. As one of the first tasks used to demonstrate RLHF, summarization remains one of the most mature testbeds of LM self-evaluation for long-form generation. With comprehensive scoring guidelines and human-written references, summarization fits our use case perfectly.\n2. Cost. Our experiment—like most involving frontier LLMs—is costly, particularly due to the number of control tasks included in the fine-tuning experiment. Not counting the Cloud compute costs for Llama experiments, we used roughly 300 million tokens via inference API for evaluation, and 150 million tokens for fine-tuning. \n3. Diversity. Although both XSUM and CNN/DailyMail are summarization tasks which follow the same evaluation protocol, the difference between them—extractive vs. abstractive summarization—improves the diversity of the evaluation and provides evidence for the generality of self-recognition/preference, as analyzed in Sec 3.2 and Figure 7.\n\n> Scaling effects\n\nBased on our experiments, larger and more capable models do appear better at self-recognition. One hypothesis is that larger models’ output probabilities are more focused around their own generations. State-of-the-art LLM detection methods compute the LLM’s perplexity on generated text vs. perturbed versions and use that gap for detection. Given evidence that suggests that detection is at least not more difficult for larger and more capable LLMs, we hypothesize that larger LLMs’ perplexity is more sensitive to whether the text is generated by the LLM. If self-recognition relies on similar mechanisms as detection methods (this is one hypothesis we are investigating), then this might explain why larger LLMs are better at self-recognition.\n\n> Significance of difference in preference between humans and LLMs\n\nUsing the pairwise format, we run a Chi-squared test of statistical significance for the difference between self-preference (Figure 4) and human preference (Sec 2.5), and find that the difference is significant (p-value << 0.001) for GPT-4 (compared to GPT-3.5 and Llama 2) even prior to fine-tuning, and significant (p-value ~ 0.007) for GPT-3.5 after fine-tuning on 10 examples for self-recognition ability. We will update the draft with these more comprehensive details.\n\n> Prompt sensitivity\n\nIn our initial experiments, self-recognition/self-preference seems insensitive to instructions in the prompt. We refrain from prompts like “Don’t be biased to your own outputs” in self-preference evaluation because we don’t have a good way to decouple the effect of priming the model to think that one of the inputs is from itself. For this submission, we wanted to stick to the main message so as to not confuse readers. For follow-up work we will perform more thorough prompt engineering, including giving GPT-4 a better prior of the likelihood of its own outputs showing up.\n\nThank you again for your time.

We frequently see LLMs assigning the same score to most or all summaries. If we report the greedily sampled score, we will essentially see zero recognition/preference across the board. To get a better idea of the fine-grained differences that the LLMs might pick up, we choose to report the weighted average.\n\n> ...intuition that self-recognition scores should increase as the dissimilarity between evaluator and evaluatee increases\n\nGreat question. We are still undecided on this intuition. This specific result can be an isolated phenomenon due to GPT-4’s bias to not recognize anything as written by itself.

The two experiments you suggested are in fact already in the paper (please let us know if there are better ways to highlight them).

It is not ""an LLM prefers a sentence due to it is generated by itself"", but ""an LLM generates a sentence due to it prefer it"".\n\nThis is incorrect. Since all the summaries are generated by LLMs without reference summaries, the hypothesis ""an LLM generates a sentence due to it prefer it"" would not even comply with the generation process.\n\n> Correct me if I am wrong. I think there is another confounder in fine-tuning. Is there any chance that the fine-tuning lets the model learn a shortcut that selects the labeled one?\n\nThis is incorrect. First, the fine-tuning examples are distinct from the evaluation examples, and the ordering of the two options are randomized & balanced for both, so the increase in self-preference cannot be trivially explained. If by “overfitting” and “shortcut learned during fine-tuning” you are referring to the phenomenon that in self-preference evaluation, the model recognizes patterns it learned about its own generation in fine-tuning, and that causes more bias—this would exactly in line with our causal hypothesis that self-preference is caused by recognition of itself.\n\nWe are not trying to explain *how* the model is recognizing itself; our hypothesis is focused on its effect on self-preference. We only control for confounders between these two properties, not shortcuts that the model can use for self-recognition. Note that the experiment suggested by the reviewer is already in the paper—fine-tuning to select a shorter/longer summary from the pair (Section 3.4)—along with many other control tasks. This did not significantly affect either self-recognition or self-preference strength.\n\n> Limited scope\n\nWe agree that experimenting on more tasks is worthwhile and will update the paper once more experiments are completed.

And then ask them to evaluate which one is better.\n\nWe have conducted this exact experiment in Section 3.5, where we label the source of each piece of text and re-evaluate self-preference. This indeed leads to increase in self-preference as you hypothesized. We further experimented with using intentionally incorrect labels. This is to check if the model is capable of recognizing the real generation from textual features even when we “lie” to them in the prompt, and indeed, especially for GPT-4 on the CNN/DailyMail dataset, the model still strongly prefers its own generation (the real one) when we lie to GPT-4 that the other summary is generated by it.\n\nThanks again for the careful review.

Besides, there is an easier way to verify if LLM prefers their own generation because they recognize themselves. We can directly tell them which one is generated by themself and which one is not.

Traditional approaches predominantly address Normal Outliers, which are activations across all tokens with relatively large magnitudes. However, these methods struggle with smoothing Massive Outliers that display significantly larger values, which leads to significant performance degradation in low-bit quantization. In this paper, we introduce DuQuant, a novel approach that utilizes rotation and permutation transformations to more effectively mitigate both massive and normal outliers. First, DuQuant starts by constructing the rotation matrix, using specific outlier dimensions as prior knowledge, to redistribute outliers to adjacent channels by block-wise rotation. Second, We further employ a zigzag permutation to balance the distribution of outliers across blocks, thereby reducing block-wise variance. A subsequent rotation further smooths the activation landscape, enhancing model performance. DuQuant simplifies the quantization process and excels in managing outliers, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines across various sizes and types of LLMs on multiple tasks, even with 4-bit weight-activation quantization.

We will move the memory consumption reduction results to the main body for better visibility. Additionally, to provide a more comprehensive comparison, we have conducted evaluations of our DuQuant alongside SmoothQuant [1], QLLM [2], and QuaRot [3] using one RTX 3090 GPU during the prefilling stage.

LLM generation process includes a pre-filling stage, which is compute-bound, along with a decoding stage, which is memory-bound [1]. To comprehensively analyze these procedures, we will list a table in the revised manuscript comparing model performance with key features such as decoding memory usage and pre-filling time. For pre-filling, we measure time usage by sending one sentence with 2048 tokens and we decode 128 steps to compute peak memory usage. All the experiments are conducted on a single RTX 3090 GPU.\n>\n>   |INT4, BS=1|Time (ms)|Saving Factor|Memory (GB)|Saving Factor|WiKi↓|QA  avg.↑|\n>   |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n>   |FP16|568| -| 13.638|-| 5.47| 63.72 |\n>   |SmoothQuant | 248 | 2.290x| 3.890| 3.506x| 83.12|44.52|\n>   |QLLM|435|1.306x | 3.894| 3.502x| 9.09| 51.60|\n>   |QuaRot|284|2.000x | 3.891| 3.505x| 6.39| 61.25|\n>   |DuQuant|288|1.972x| 3.893| 3.503x| 6.28|61.76|\n>\n> - From the table, we can observe that our DuQuant effectively speeds up the pre-filling stage and largely reduces memory usage during decoding stage while providing **the most competitive results**.\n> - Due to time constraints and the significant workload involved, we couldn't test all methods on real-world generative tasks that require complex CUDA kernel optimizations. However, we are committed to continually optimizing DuQuant to improve its speed and efficiency in future updates.\n> - In addition, we present a simple **time complexity analysis** of our quantization process. We denote activation as $X\\in\\mathbf{R}^{N\\times C}$, block size as $B$, and greedy search step size as $n$. The complexity of obtaining the rotation matrix of a linear projection is caused by (1) QR decomposition $O(nB^3)$, (2) Rotation matrices multiplication $O(nB^3)$, and (3) Multiplication between $X$ and rotation matrics $O(n\\times NC/B \\times B \\times B)=O(nNCB)$. Thus, the total complexity is $O(nB^3+nNCB)$. For example, in LLaMa2-7B k_proj, we take $N=2048, C=4096$. We set $B=128,n=256$, then we can get the approximate computation complexity $nB^3+nNCB\\approx 2.7\\times 10^{11}$, which is less than the necessary WA multiplication complexity (approximately equal to $NC^2\\approx 3.4\\times 10^{11})$. This simple analysis demonstrates the efficiency of our quantization process.\n> \n> [1] Quarot: Outlier-free 4-bit inference in rotated llms, arXiv 2024.\n\n\n**W3**： Massive outliers and attention sinks\n> - Thank you for the clarification. We will correct the distinction between massive activations and attention sinks in the revised manuscript.\n\n\n**Q1**: DuQuant on Mistral and Phi models.\n\n> - We appreciate the inquiry and have extended the application of DuQuant to include Mistral and Phi models under 4-bit WA quantization. The PPL results are shown in the table below:\n>\n>   |Mistral-7B|WiKi| C4|\n>   |-|-|-|\n>   |FP16| 5.25| 7.75|\n>   |RTN| 306.26| 300.07|\n>   |SmoothQuant |100.59|158.02|\n>   |OmniQuant|5490.31|6094.82|\n>   |Atom| 8.65|12.43|\n>   |DuQuant| **5.86**| **8.48**|\n>\n>   |Phi2-2.8B|WiKi|C4|\n>   |-|-|-|\n>   |FP16 |9.71|12.76|\n>   |RTN|230.59|253.79|\n>   |SmoothQuant| 63.84|83.24|\n>   |OmniQuant|NaN|NaN|\n>   |Atom| 35.72|41.26|\n>   |DuQuant|**20.65**|**22.49**|\n>\n> - From the table, we can observe that DuQuant **largely surpasses other baselines**, particularly with **Mistral-7B**. Regarding the Phi2-2.8B model, it often experiences **instability** in matrix multiplication **between queries and values**, leading to **overflow** issues and posing great challenges to quantization. However, while DuQuant may not perform as well as FP models, it still significantly outperforms other baselines.\n> - In addition, we have visualized the massive outliers in the **down_proj** layer of the **Mistral-7B** model and the feature space after our dual transformations. These visualizations are available in the PDF file included in the general response section. It can be observed that our DuQuant perfectly eliminates these outliers.\n> - These results underscore the effectiveness of our dual transformation approach in addressing massive outliers **across various types of LLMs**.""}}, 'id': '4wmugXuUR5', 'forum': 'mp8u2Pcmqz', 'replyto': '03iCetjPVL', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5272/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5272/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5272/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723017622840, 'cdate': 1723017622840, 'tmdate': 1730881308808, 'mdate': 1730881308808, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We sincerely thank the reviewer for providing valuable feedback.

In addition, PPL might not be a reliable evaluation to reflect the model’s effectiveness in real-world tasks [2].

These results underscore the contribution of each component to the overall effectiveness of DuQuant.\n\n**Q4**: Discussion about calibration-free experiments.\n> - Our findings in Appendix E.4 demonstrate that DuQuant does not depend on specific calibration data, suggesting that outliers are inherent to certain model layers and are **characteristic of the model weights or modules**. This is supported by two recent works:\n>   -  [3] identifies consistent massive outliers specifically at the FFN down projection layer in GLU-based LLMs, such as LLaMA, Mistral, Mixtral, SOLAR, and Gemma.\n>   -  [4] investigates the impact of calibration sets on quantization, finding that while OPT models are sensitive to varying calibration sets, newer models like Llama, Command-R, and Mistral show robustness to outliers and stable activations.\n> - These insights confirm that outliers exhibit **consistent distributions** for recent LLMs, which is a property of the weights and modules.\n>  [3] Mitigating Quantization Errors Due to Activation Spikes in GLU-Based LLMs, arXiv 2024.\n>\n>  [4] Outliers and Calibration Sets have Diminishing Effect on Quantization of Modern LLMs, arXiv 2024.\n\n**L1**: Statistical significance.\n> - We apologize for the oversight.

We have dedicated **Appendix F** to highlighting our novel contributions and demonstrating our superiority over QuaRot. We summarize our key contributions below.\n>   - Instead of adopting the Hadamard rotation used in QuaRot, we use a greedy search algorithm that leverages prior knowledge to compute an **approximately ideal rotation matrix** that (1) is orthogonal and (2) specifically targets the positions of outliers, redistributing them across adjacent channels. **Figure 4** advocates the superiority of DuQuant in mitigating outliers compared to the Hadamard rotation.\n>   - We introduce the **zigzag permutation** that reduces activation magnitude variance between blocks, further reducing the overall outliers. The ablation study in **Table 5** highlights the significance of this permutation.\n>   - Our rotation and permutation matrices **simultaneously smooth weights** and activations. Consequently, DuQuant avoids the time-consuming GPTQ used by QuaRot. **Table F17** illustrates the significantly higher efficiency of DuQuant.\n>   - Due to these contributions, DuQuant consistently outperforms QuaRot.

Traditional approaches predominantly address Normal Outliers, which are activations across all tokens with relatively large magnitudes. However, these methods struggle with smoothing Massive Outliers that display significantly larger values, which leads to significant performance degradation in low-bit quantization. In this paper, we introduce DuQuant, a novel approach that utilizes rotation and permutation transformations to more effectively mitigate both massive and normal outliers. First, DuQuant starts by constructing the rotation matrix, using specific outlier dimensions as prior knowledge, to redistribute outliers to adjacent channels by block-wise rotation. Second, We further employ a zigzag permutation to balance the distribution of outliers across blocks, thereby reducing block-wise variance. A subsequent rotation further smooths the activation landscape, enhancing model performance. DuQuant simplifies the quantization process and excels in managing outliers, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines across various sizes and types of LLMs on multiple tasks, even with 4-bit weight-activation quantization.

As such, adapters have been widely adopted by open-source communities, accumulating a database of over 100K adapters—most of which are highly customized with insufficient descriptions. To generate high quality images, this paper explores the problem of matching the prompt to a Stylus of relevant adapters, built on recent work that highlight the performance gains of composing adapters. We introduce Stylus, which efficiently selects and automatically composes task-specific adapters based on a prompt's keywords. Stylus outlines a three-stage approach that first summarizes adapters with improved descriptions and embeddings, retrieves relevant adapters, and then further assembles adapters based on prompts' keywords by checking how well they fit the prompt. To evaluate Stylus, we developed StylusDocs, a curated dataset featuring 75K adapters with pre-computed adapter embeddings.

This is the version of Stylus presented throughout our paper.\n- GPT-4o Refiner: Use GPT-4o as the Refiner’s VLM.\n \nWithout the refiner, the poor quality of author-provided descriptions results in Stylus performing worse than SDv1.5. However, the high quality of adapter descriptions from the GPT-4o Refiner results in the best performance, surpassing Gemini-Ultra Refiner, the original refiner VLM.\n\n**Safety and Reliability of Adapter Descriptions (QQJ7, wGTi).** Stylus ensures adapter *safety* through a multi-stage filtering pipeline, initially excluding all explicitly tagged adapters by Civit.ai (Sec 3.2), followed by using Google's VertexAI API filters to reject unsafe adapters based on LLM-generated descriptions (Sec. A.7). For *reliability/accuracy,* Stylus's refiner uses example images from Civit.ai’s model card as a grounding mechanism to generate more accurate descriptions (Sec A.1), and we manually inspect and blacklist low-quality, explicit, or highly-inaccurate adapters (Sec A.4).\n\n**Masking and Merging Clarification (QQJ7, rCTt, wGTi).** Reviewers asked for more clarity on Stylus’s masking and merging steps. Recall that the composer decomposes the prompt into tasks and maps highly relevant adapters to each task. For each task, a mask either selects A) just one of the task’s adapters, B) all of the task’s adapters, C) or none of the adapters. The selected adapters are then merged, with adapter weights *averaged* per task and then *summed* across tasks.""}}, 'id': 'p8zhoNy5hj', 'forum': '3Odq2tGSpp', 'replyto': '3Odq2tGSpp', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11839/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11839/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11839/-/Author_Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723009568644, 'cdate': 1723009568644, 'tmdate': 1730888471905, 'mdate': 1730888471905, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We appreciate the thoughtful and enthusiastic review!\n\n**Reproducibility.** We plan to release Stylus and StylusDocs as open-source resources to ensure transparency and reproducibility.\n\n**Adapter selection and masking.** The composer decomposes the prompt into tasks and maps highly relevant adapters to each task.

We hope the following clarifications and experiments address your questions.\n \n**Efficiency.**  We note that Stylus\'s efficiency for image generation in terms of CPU and GPU resources is near identical to the base Stable Diffusion (SD) model. Aside from merging adapters (e.g. LoRAs) into the base model, which is small, the inference computation remains the same. Additional CPU memory is required to store unmerged adapters, as evidenced by efficient LoRA serving systems such as SLoRA [1] and dLoRA [2].\n\nWe emphasize that users today rely on manual search to identify a helpful subset of adapters. Stylus automates the process of determining the best set of adapters for a given user prompt, improving user efficiency. Furthermore, with recent releases of fast, high quality LLMs (i.e. GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Flash), the composer’s latency will continue to reduce over time. We profiled GPT-4o-mini as the composer, which is over 3x faster than Gemini 1.5. This is a small overhead when compared to manual search over adapters.\n\n**Fairness.** Stylus serves as an automatic enhancement to SD, leveraging additional training and data represented by LoRAs. Our retriever ablation (Sec. 4.3.1, Tab. 1) shows that naively selecting adapters (i.e. RAG) can lead to worse performance than the typical SD checkpoint. As such, we include base SD’s CLIP and FID scores as a reference for comparing different approaches to selecting and composing adapters. \n\n**Adapter descriptions.** First, we note that, without access to the original fine-tuning dataset, we cannot guarantee the descriptions are completely error-free. However, we manually inspect commonly selected adapters in StylusDocs, blacklisting adapters that produce low quality images or cases where the StylusDocs description is inconsistent with observed adapter behavior (Sec A.4).  Furthermore, we observe that over 80% of adapters on model platforms (Civit.ai/Huggingface) lack sufficient descriptions. As such, Stylus’s refiner takes in example images from Civit.ai’s model card as a grounding mechanism to generate more detailed and accurate descriptions (Sec A.1).\n\nFurthermore, we add an additional refiner ablation that showcases that better adapter descriptions lead to performance gains. In the following table of CLIP/FID scores, we illustrate Stylus without and with refiner.\n\n| Baselines (CFG=6)        | CLIP: ↑ is better     | FID: ↓ is better      |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| SD v1.5                  | 27.22                 | 23.96                 |\n| No-Refiner               | 24.91 (-2.31)         | 24.26 (+0.3)          |\n| Gemini-Ultra Refiner     | 27.25 (+0.03)         | 22.05 (-1.91)         |\n| **GPT-4o Refiner**                  | **28.04 (+0.82)**     | **21.96 (-2.00)**     |\n\nHere, the baselines are:\n- SD v1.5 - The base Stable Diffusion model with the RealisticVision checkpoint.\n- No-Refiner: Use base author-provided descriptions from Civit.ai or Huggingface.\n- Gemini-Ultra Refiner: Use Gemini-Ultra as the Refiner’s VLM to generate better adapter descriptions. This is the version of Stylus presented throughout our paper.\n- GPT-4o Refiner: Use GPT-4o as the Refiner’s VLM.\n\nThe quality of author-provided descriptions are poor, leading to worse performance than the typical SD checkpoint. Further improved refiner descriptions from GPT-4o can significantly boost Stylus’s performance, achieving the best textual alignment (CLIP) and image quality (FID) across all baselines, surpassing our original Stylus (with Gemini-Ultra).\n\n**Merging Adapters.** We clarify Eqn. 2 *averages* adapter weights per task and *sums* adapter weights across tasks. We take several measures below to ensure that the second term in Eqn. 2 does not grow too large:\n- Our masking scheme reduces the number of adapters in the final composition of LoRAs. (Sec 3.4)\n- Empirically, with the COCO dataset, we observed the composer identifies at most seven tasks with associated adapters. We also have the option in the composer’s prompt to limit the number of tasks (Tab. 2).\n- β scales down the rate at which the second term grows. We determined β=0.8 prevents highly-weighted adapters from overriding other concepts specified in the prompt, a challenge discussed in Fig. 13(b).\n\nWe appreciate your feedback and believe these clarifications should address your concerns.

We hope the following clarifications address all the questions raised.\n\n**Quality Assurance for Adapters.** We have taken careful preemptive measures to filter out problematic adapters and have outlined in Appendix A.7 a continual curation process, where we invite community members to report any adapters missed in our initial curation. Below, we highlight some key preventative measures for quality assurance and refer readers to Appendix A.7 and A.8 for a full discussion on safety and reliability of Stylus.\n\n- **Safety.** Although LLM safety remains an actively evolving research area [1], StylusDocs employs a multi-stage filtering pipeline to identify and exclude problematic adapters. First, all explicit adapters tagged by Civit.ai are excluded from StylusDocs (Sec 3.2). Second, we use filters from Google’s VertexAI API to reject unsafe adapters based on LLM-generated descriptions. This especially catches problematic adapters that have innocuous original descriptions (Sec. A.7).\n- **Accuracy/Reliability.** We note that, without access to the original fine-tuning dataset, we cannot guarantee the descriptions are completely error-free. However, we manually inspect commonly selected adapters in StylusDocs, blacklisting adapters that produce low quality images or cases where the StylusDocs description is inconsistent with observed adapter behavior (Sec A.4). Furthermore, authors are incentivized to oversell the model’s abilities. As such, Stylus’s refiner takes in example images in Civit.ai’s model card as a grounding mechanism to generate more accurate descriptions (Sec A.1).\n\nEven with the safety measures we’ve taken, we acknowledge Stylus has the same risks of misuse as other public domain image generation tools including improper use for misinformation, producing explicit content, and reproducing copy-righted material from the training data. We emphasize the research prototype is not meant to be used in production without further application informed guardrails.\n\n**Refiner Ablation.** In the following table containing CLIP and FID scores, we ablate Stylus\'s refiner:\n\n| Baselines (CFG=6)        | CLIP: ↑ is better     | FID: ↓ is better      |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| SD v1.5                  | 27.22                 | 23.96                 |\n| No-Refiner               | 24.91 (-2.31)         | 24.26 (+0.3)          |\n| Gemini-Ultra Refiner     | 27.25 (+0.03)         | 22.05 (-1.91)         |\n| **GPT-4o Refiner**                  | **28.04 (+0.82)**     | **21.96 (-2.00)**     |\n\nThe baselines are:\n- SD v1.5 - The base Stable Diffusion model with the RealisticVision checkpoint.\n- No-Refiner: Use base author-provided descriptions from Civit.ai or Huggingface.\n- Gemini-Ultra Refiner: Use Gemini-Ultra as the Refiner’s VLM to generate better adapter descriptions. This is the version of Stylus presented throughout our paper.\n- GPT-4o Refiner: Use GPT-4o as the Refiner’s VLM to generate better adapter descriptions.\n\nThese results show that a refiner is indeed important for textual alignment with the prompt. In fact, without a refiner VLM, Stylus performs poorly and chooses adapters that the composer thinks are aligned with the prompt but are not in practice. As a result, Stylus chooses adapters that hurt textual alignment (CLIP) and image quality (FID) and performs worse than base SD.\n\nFurthermore, GPT-4o baseline performs much better than Gemini-Ultra, showing that better refiner descriptions can better aid the composer in selecting the right adapters. This also suggests that the Stylus’s performance is independent of Gemini-specific capabilities and benefits from further improved visual-language reasoning capabilities.\n\n**Choice of Gemini for Refiner.** We chose the Gemini class of models since it has mature safety guardrailing. Specifically, Google’s VertexAI API provides stringent safety settings to block explicit content for the input prompt. Safety filters helped us filter out around 30% of original adapters that were tagged as non-explicit by Civit.ai.\n\n**Masking.** The composer decomposes a prompt into tasks and assigns highly-aligned adapters per task. Next, a subset of candidate adapters are selected via masking for image generation. For each task, a mask either selects A) just one of the task’s adapters, B) all of the task’s adapters, C) or none of the adapters. To get the final selection of adapters, we randomly sample a mask for each task and merge the identified adapters to the original base model.\n\nRegarding merging adapters, each adapter weights are first multiplied by the refiner’s recommended adapter weight, α_j (Eqn. 2). For example, [Food Elegant Style LoRA](https://civitai.com/models/127450?modelVersionId=139441) recommends α=0.7 weight. Finally, to merge adapters into the base model, adapters weights are *averaged* per task and then *summed* across tasks.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback and believe these clarifications should address your concerns.

Taken together, our improvements set new benchmarks in one-step image generation, with FID scores of 1.28 on ImageNet-64×64 and 8.35 on zero-shot COCO 2014, surpassing the original teacher despite a 500X reduction in inference cost.Further, we show our approach can generate megapixel images by distilling SDXL, demonstrating exceptional visual quality among few-step methods, and surpassing the teacher.

We will fix all typos. Below, we address the remaining concerns.\n\n**How is DMD2 related to ADD and LADD? What is the most significant difference?**\n\nThank you for the opportunity to discuss how DMD2 relates to other concurrent GAN based methods such as ADD and LADD. The ADD paper [23] utilizes a pretrained DINO-based classifier in pixel space, which we found to be less efficient in terms of training and leading to reduced diversity, as detailed in Table 6. More recent efforts like LADD, UFOGEN, and SDXL-Lightning employ latent diffusion GAN-based networks akin to our DMD2. A significant difference, which is often overlooked, is that DMD-style training inherently integrates classifier-free guidance directly into the real score of the DMD gradient. This integration simplifies the training process of our model. In contrast, purely GAN-based methods typically struggle to incorporate classifier-free guidance directly. For example, SDXL-Lightning needs to combine GAN with progressive distillation to enable CFG, while LADD relies on diffusion generated images with CFG as real data in its GAN discriminator. These approaches often complicate the training process. We will elaborate further on these distinctions in the related work section of our revised paper.  \n\n**The original DMD paper [22] demonstrated examples of mode collapse when omitting the regression loss. GANs (at least some) are also known to be prone to mode collapse. Could you mention anything about the mode collapse situation in this method? (Since the FID numbers are good, I assume that this is also good, but since this was a main point of analysis in [22]?)**\n\nSimilar to our response to Reviewer xYYF, we assess the mode collapse situation under two scenarios:\n\n- Class-Conditional Image Generation: We observed no mode collapse, as evidenced by the state-of-the-art FID scores for image generation (see Table 1).\n- Text-to-Image Generation: This scenario is more complex. We utilize classifier-free guidance, which typically trades diversity for image quality. At high guidance settings, using the SDXL baseline, we achieved superior image quality with diversity comparable to or better than other distillation methods but slightly worse than the teacher model ((see Table 6 and the new results in our Response to Reviewer aF5v). \n\nOur current framework trains stably and produces excellent image quality. However, there remains a small gap in output diversity compared to the original teacher model and we are open to exploring future methods that might enhance this diversity/quality tradeoff by better integrating trajectory-preserving techniques (such as the more efficient consistency distillation) with distribution matching methods. We believe this is a promising direction for future research.""}}, 'id': 'lOdL2m50gh', 'forum': 'tQukGCDaNT', 'replyto': 'jdg6f4HO2G', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1257/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1257/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1257/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722928638617, 'cdate': 1722928638617, 'tmdate': 1730880522333, 'mdate': 1730880522333, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We sincerely appreciate Reviewer uheV\'s constructive feedback. Below, we address the remaining concerns.\n\n**How to select the set of hyperparameters?**\n\nThank you for your question. Our approach to selecting hyperparameters is straightforward and consistent across all datasets. We utilize the maximum batch size our compute setup allows. The learning rate is determined as the highest value that does not cause divergent loss within the first 500 iterations. We set the number of TTUR iterations to the minimum required for stability. The guidance scale is chosen based on what yields the best results for the teacher model. For the GAN weight, our method works well across a wide range of values, as demonstrated by the following ImageNet FID scores:\n\n| Weight  | ImaegNet FID |\n| - | - |\n| 2e-3 | 1.31 | \n| 3e-3 | 1.28 | \n| 4e-3 | 1.28 | \n| 5e-3 | 1.26 | \n| 1e-2 | 1.30 |\n\nWe will include these guidelines in our updated version. \n\n**For the point of “limited model capacity”, does it mean that if the student has the same network with SDXL, by any means, we are not able to achieve a one-step generation that matches SDXL’s performance?**\n\nWe are open to the possibility of a one-step generation that matches the performance of the teacher model. However, we want to emphasize that achieving this in a single-step generation is substantially more challenging than in a multi-step process, especially when distilling complex networks like SDXL. While our one-step generator can match the teacher model in quantitative metrics such as FID, qualitative aspects of image quality present greater challenges. Visually, the one-step process still produces some artifacts that are difficult to eliminate (See Figure 11). An exciting direction for future research could involve refining our training objectives to address these issues more directly, as seen in recent developments like those explored in HyperSD [1].\n\n**For the point of “a complex optimization landscape”, it seems that both SDv1.5 and SDXL are trained on LAION dataset, which means they are both trying to learn the same mapping from noise to data. Does it mean the higher-quality generation of SDXL (rather the training data of teacher models) hinders the one-step distillation?**\n\nWhile both models are trained on the LAION dataset, they likely utilize different subsets, leading to variations in the noise-to-data mapping. The higher quality and particularly the subtler details found in SDXL are indeed more challenging to capture, potentially requiring more advancements in loss design. \n\n **I wonder if it is possible to tune the hyperparameters of distilling SDXL for a better one-step generator. For example, in Appendix G, the batch size for distilling SDXL is only 128 while the batch size for distilling SDv1.5 is only 2048. If DMD2 is sensitive to batch size in the large-scale text-to-image case, can we increase the batch size for distilling SDXL to 2048 during training for improved performance?**\n\nWe have observed improved performance with increased batch sizes and compute. We used a batch size of 128 for SDXL, as this is the maximum our current setup can accommodate within our compute budget of 3 days—especially considering that the SDXL model is three times larger than SDv1.5. Exploring a larger batch size, such as 2048, with additional resources in the future would indeed be an interesting experiment to potentially enhance performance further.\n\n**Some Writing Inconsistency**\n\nThank you for pointing out these inconsistencies. Regarding the discrepancy between 50 and 100 steps in Figure 4, the teacher model uses 50 steps, but effectively has 100 forward passes due to the application of classifier-free guidance. For EDM, upon reevaluating the released model, we recorded a FID of 2.32, which we will update to 2.22 in our revised version to reflect the most accurate data. We appreciate your attention to detail and will correct the remaining issues. Thank you again for your valuable feedback.\n\n**Extra cost per training iteration of backward simulation**\n\nThank you for raising the issue of training computational cost. The training iteration time for the model with backward simulation is approximately 9.2 seconds per iteration, compared to 7.8 seconds for the model without backward simulation. We also discovered that enabling backward simulation only during the last 20% of the training epochs yields comparable results. This approach offers a more computationally efficient option when resources are limited. \n\n**From the numbers in Table 2, it looks like the 4-step distillation improves Patch FID but gets worse FID and CLIP, compared to 1-step distillation. Any justification?**\n\nFrom the data in Table 2, the difference in FID between the one-step and four-step distillation (0.3) is generally within the range of variability observed across different runs, indicating comparable performance. The significant improvement in Patch FID for the four-step distillation reflects better local image detail, aligning with qualitative improvements we observed. However, the CLIP score did decrease, which may suggest that the four-step method slightly sacrifices prompt alignment for image quality. This also happens for previous approaches with good text to image alignment like SDXL-Turbo.\n\n[1] Ren, Yuxi, et al.

Below, we address the remaining concerns.\n\n**It would be better to include a detailed training algorithm to clearly showcase the modifications over the original DMD training process.**\n\nThank you for your suggestion. As you accurately summarized, our DMD2 model eliminates the need for the regression loss and incorporates a diffusion GAN loss along with backward simulation to mitigate training-inference mismatches. To clearly illustrate these modifications over the original DMD training process, we will include a detailed comparison of the training algorithms in the revised version of our paper. \n\n**In practice, the real data used to train the (teacher) diffusion models may not be accessible to the users who hope to distill a small (student) generation model (due to privacy, storage, …). In that case, one limitation of DMD2 is the calculation of GAN loss may become inapplicable. Could you share your opinions about this matter?**\n\nWe acknowledge that DMD2 relies on access to real data to enhance diversity and image quality. However, it is important to note that the exact dataset used to train the teacher model is not required. For our training, we utilized a random set of 500,000 images from the LAION database, which is generally of lower quality than the curated aesthetic dataset of SDXL. This demonstrates that our GAN loss can be effectively applied using an alternative dataset, underscoring its versatility and universal applicability, regardless of the specific model being distilled.\n\n\n**In the original DMD paper, the regression loss is capable of mitigating the issue of mode collapse. Would DMD2 also suffer from this issue as the regression loss is removed and an extra GAN loss is introduced?**\n\nThank you for your question. In DMD2, we demonstrate that much of the mode collapse observed in the original DMD method relates more to training issues than to an inherent inability of the DMD loss to support diverse generator training. Practically, we can assess the final performance under two scenarios:\n\n- Class-Conditional Image Generation: We observed no mode collapse, as evidenced by the state-of-the-art FID scores for image generation (see Table 1).\n- Text-to-Image Generation: This scenario is more complex. We utilize classifier-free guidance, which typically trades diversity for image quality.

However, we are open to exploring future methods that might enhance this diversity/quality tradeoff by better integrating trajectory-preserving techniques (such as the more efficient consistency distillation) with distribution matching methods. We believe this is a promising direction for further research.\n\n**Why intermediate outputs of DMD2 follow a certain trajectory?**\n\nThis observation was initially surprising to us as well. Although our generator does not follow the teacher diffusion model’s sampling trajectory, our training methods lead to few-step generators where the first output significantly shapes the general structure. Subsequent images tend to closely resemble this initial output. This effect is likely influenced by the relatively high signal-to-noise ratios in subsequent sampling steps, which preserve much of the structure even after noise injection.""}}, 'id': 'jSnn8LYaAt', 'forum': 'tQukGCDaNT', 'replyto': 'xDWT33Illg', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1257/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1257/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1257/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722928190670, 'cdate': 1722928190670, 'tmdate': 1730880522427, 'mdate': 1730880522427, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""We sincerely appreciate Reviewer aF5v's constructive feedback.

In fact, our model does incorporate real data during training via the GAN loss component. This inclusion enhances diversity and helps to prevent mode collapse. The positive impact of integrating GAN loss with real data is evident in the improved performance detailed in Tables 3 and 4.\n\n**As proposed distillation objective is not sampling w.r.t teacher's marginal predictive distribution nor data-distribution.

We have indeed conducted a diversity assessment using LPIPS diversity metrics, which is presented in Table 6 of the appendix. Our results indicate that our model's diversity is on par with other distillation approaches, such as the latent consistency model, and significantly exceeds that of purely GAN-based methods like SDXL-Turbo. While our model shows slightly worse diversity compared to the teacher model, it offers substantially better image quality, as illustrated in Figure 5. We believe this often represents a more advantageous trade-off for practical text-to-image applications.\n\n**Also it would be useful to understand what stage of training causes this mode collapse, i.e., does small scale training preserve diversity at cost of some quality drop or we observe a consistent drop in diversity?**\n\nThank you for your suggestion! In response, we retrained our SDXL model and monitored diversity metrics throughout the training process. The results from this new run showed a small diversity improvement over those reported in our paper. Specifically, the model displays higher diversity at the beginning, which gradually diminishes as image quality improves. Despite this trend, the final diversity scores of the model remain closely comparable to those of the teacher model (0.63 vs 0.64 for the teacher), indicating a well-maintained balance between diversity and image quality.\n\n| Train Iter | LPIPS Diversity |\n| - | - | \n| 0 | 0.25 |\n| 4k | 0.65 |\n| 8k | 0.64 | \n| 12k | 0.65 | \n| 16k | 0.64 | \n| 20k | 0.63 |  \n| SD Teacher Baseline | 0.64 | \n\n\n\n**Setting without backward simulation**\n\nThe reviewer’s interpretation is correct. In the setting without backward simulation, we add noise to real images and then feed these noisy images into our generator. The output from the generator is then supervised using both the DMD and GAN loss. Additionally, the fake score function is trained based on this generator output. We will clarify this process more thoroughly in the revised version of our paper.\n\n**how sensitive is alignment of fake score estimation to student's generator and how good is the quality of fake score at different stages of training and its implications?**\n\nThank you for suggesting this set of further analyses. Due to time constraints, these will be included in the revised version of our paper. Regarding the first part, we believe achieving proper alignment between the fake score estimation and the generator’s output distribution is crucial. As shown in Figure 9 of the main paper, more frequent training of the fake score—aimed at enhancing its accuracy—leads to more stable generator training and overall improved performance. We will provide a more comprehensive analysis in the revised version. For the second part, we plan to retrain an ImageNet model and monitor the performance of the fake score model at various training stages by assessing the quality of its sample outputs.

Below, we address the remaining questions regarding numerical instability and human-related metrics. \n\n**Training with GAN often entails numerical instability. Does DMD2 have such concerns? If it is true, could the author provide some details in overcoming the instability of DMD2?**\n\nThe GAN component in DMD2 does not introduce numerical instability. This stability can be attributed to our use of a diffusion GAN framework, where both the generators and discriminators are initialized from a pretrained diffusion model. Before classification, images are also treated with noise injection, enhancing stability. This method has proven more stable than traditional GANs that utilize pixel space discriminators without noise injection, as supported by several recent studies [1, 2]. Furthermore, DMD2 includes a two-timestep-scale update rule that bolsters stability. Additionally, DMD2 utilizes a weighted combination of DMD and GAN losses. The DMD loss consistently guides the overall structure of the images, preventing mode collapse and ensuring training stability even with the added GAN components.\n\n**Besides the evaluation metric such as FID and Inception scores, how about some human-related metrics such as ImageReward or aesthetic scores? Does DMD2 show comparable results to teacher SDXL?**\n\nThank you for this insightful suggestion!

We include a theoretical and experimental comparison with $k$-OSAN in an updated manuscript and believe the points below address the Reviewers' questions adequately. \n\n---\n> **W1**: “The motivation for focusing on cactus graphs is unclear…”\n\n**A1:**  Our primary focus was on developing a scalable and expressive method. Our analysis revealed a close connection to cactus graphs, a significant class between trees and tree-width 2 graphs. While the class of tree-width 2 graphs is larger, no less than cubic time GNN is known that can count all tree-width 2 graphs. Hence, our method can provably capture a smaller class than 3-WL, but is more scalable and local. This is a trade-off we make. Note that this shows that our method, while being local, is not less expressive than other non-local variants, e.g., k-OSAN. See the next answer.\n\nMoreover, many chemical datasets contain cactus graphs; $58.77\\\\%$ of ZINC250K are cactus graphs. Consider, for instance, rings with hydrogen atoms attached or any other structure (e.g., carboxyl groups). The presence of such structures, while being cactus graphs and not mere cycle graphs, can significantly alter the molecular properties of a more complex graph. The practical significance of being able to count cactus graphs is also shown by the improved predictive performance of our model when applied to chemical datasets. \n\nWe are happy to follow the Reviewer's suggestion and include this discussion on the relevance of cactus graphs in our manuscript. \n\n> **W2**: “Insufficient Comparison with Subgraph GNNs: …”\n\n**A2**: Thank you for highlighting this important direction. We will address this in detail in a potential camera-ready version, referencing Qian et al. (2022). They introduce k-OSAN and vertex-selected k-OSAN (k-VSAN), both bounded by $k+1$-WL but incomparable to $k$-WL. We can make the following simple observation: For every $k$, there exists an $r$ such that $r$-$\\ell{}$WL is not less powerful than $k$-OSAN and $k$-VSAN, following from the fact that both are less expressive than $(k+1)$-WL and Corollary 1 in our manuscript.\n\nMoreover, as a corollary of our Theorem 2, we show that for every $k \\geq 1$, there exist infinitely many graphs that $1$-$\\ell{}$WL can separate but $k$-VSAN cannot distinguish. This shows that the Reviewer’s conjecture that “r-$\\ell{}$WL may be included in k-OSAN” does not hold. \n\nThe proof of this result parallels the proof of Corollary 2 ii) in our manuscript: (B. Zhang et al., 2024) characterized the class of patterns $\\mathcal{F}^{\\mathrm{sub}(k)}$ that $k$-VSAN can homomorphism-count. There exist infinitely many cactus graphs in $\\mathcal{M}^3$ that are not in $\\mathcal{F}^{\\mathrm{sub}(k)}$. A combination of Theorem 3.8 in (B. Zhang et al., 2024) and Theorem 2 in our manuscript shows that there are infinitely many graphs that $1$-$\\ell{}$WL can separate but $k$-VSAN cannot distinguish. We will present this result in the main paper and a detailed proof in the appendix.\n\nThis result demonstrates that even our least expressive algorithm is not less powerful than any $k$-VSAN algorithm, which may be of independent interest, given that the expressive power of $k$-VSAN increases with $k$, along with its computational complexity.\n\nSince there are pairs of graphs that $1$-$\\ell{}$WL cannot distinguish but $k$-VSAN can, this proves that $1$-$\\ell{}$WL and $k$-VSAN are incomparable for any $k$.\n\n> **W3**: “Experimental Comparison: …”\n\n**A3**: We are happy to update our manuscript and include OSAN in the BREC dataset-baseline. To go beyond $3$-WL with $k$-OSAN, we would need to consider at least $2$-OSAN, which has a complexity of $n^2m$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges. This complexity is too high for our computational resources, which is why we did not use $2$-OSAN or higher-order variants as baselines, consistent with other research in this area.\n\nHowever, if the Reviewer can provide a reference with $2$-OSAN baseline results, we are happy to include those in our paper!\n\nWe will also clarify the capabilities of other methods:\n\nTable 1: PPGN has $3$-WL expressivity and can count up to 7-cycles and homomorphism-count all graphs of tree-width 2. Nested GNNs are strictly between $1$-WL and $3$-WL. GSNs include explicit subgraph counts. While GSN is more powerful than $1$-WL, its exact expressive power depends on the chosen pattern to be counted.\n\nTable 2: We have a strict hierarchy in the expressive power of the baselines we chose: MPNN ≤ Subgraph GNN ≤ local $2$-GNN ≤ local $2$-FGNN. These variants, apart from MPNNs, are more expressive than $1$-WL and can subgraph-count up to 7-cycles in theory. Their homomorphism-expressivity is fully characterized in (B. Zhang et al., 2024).  \n\nWe will add these explanations in more detail and details for other real-world experiments to our appendix.\n\n> **W4**: “Unlabeled Graphs: …“\n\n**A4**: Yes, we can easily account for graphs with vertex labels, both for the patterns we aim to subgraph- or homomorphism-count and for the graphs themselves. Note that in our empirical evaluation, all GNNs use node attributes, if available in the datasets. Our proofs require minimal modifications to accommodate vertex labels. We will follow your suggestion and update our manuscript to include these modifications. Thank you!\n\nMinor Comments:\n\nLine 71: We referred to Tinhofer, who proved that two graphs are fractionally isomorphic if and only if $1$-WL does not distinguish them. This result was used by Dell et al. (2018) to prove that $1$-WL is equivalent to the homomorphism-counts of all trees. We would ask the Reviewer kindly to specify the Dvorak references so that we can add a citation if applicable.\n\nLine 96: We will remove the Dimitrov 2023 reference from this line.\n\n---\n\nThank you again for your valuable feedback, which led to new insights and results.

NeurIPS 2022.\n\n> **Q1**: “How does the computational complexity of $r$-$\\ell{}$WL compared to existing higher-order $k$-WL variants like $3$-WL in practice, especially when dealing with large and dense graphs?\n\n**A1**: When dealing with dense graphs, i.e., graphs with $n^2$ edges the computational complexity of $r$-$\\ell{}$WL is comparable to the complexity of $k$-WL. In the worst-case scenario, assuming a complete graph, every node has $n$ neighbors. Hence, the preprocessing step requires $n*n^{r+2}$ operations and the number of forward operations is also exponential in $r$. This is a limitation for large and dense graphs. We noted this in our manuscript, see Page 9 under Limitations.  From a practical perspective, our method currently scales well to the Peptides dataset, even when using $r=7$, which contains 15k graphs with on average 151 nodes and 307 edges.\n\n> **Q2**: “What are the limitations of $r$-$\\ell{}$WL in terms of scalability and memory usage, particularly when applied to real-world datasets with varying degrees of sparsity?”\n\n**A2**: Our $r$-$\\ell{}$WL algorithm is particularly well-suited for sparser graphs, as demonstrated in our experiments. This focus allows us to efficiently handle a wide range of real-world datasets that exhibit sparsity. While there are scalability and memory challenges when dealing with denser graphs, we see this as an exciting opportunity for future enhancements. To increase scalability and manage memory usage more effectively, one potential future direction includes random subsampling methods to subsample paths per node. We are actively researching ways to optimize our method to better manage dense graphs, thereby broadening the applicability of our algorithm across diverse datasets.\n\n> **Q3**: “In Table 1, why didn\'t your method perform well on the Extension (100) and CFI (100) datasets compared to 3-WL and PPGN?”\n\n**A3**: Wang et al. [1] note that 3-WL and PPGN “surpasses most GNNs in CFI graphs due to k-WL’s global receptive field.” Whereas local WL variants like our $r$-$\\ell{}$WL exhibit lower performance due to their limited receptive fields.\nWe also mention that CFI graphs are particularly challenging; specifically, 60 pairs are distinguishable only by 3-WL, 20 by 4-WL, and 20 remain indistinguishable even by 4-WL. To improve performance, we would need to increase $r$. However, this runs into memory issues given our current resources, as CFI graphs contain many paths in the $r$-neighborhoods, often having a high number of edges (up to 742).\n\nOur method successfully distinguished 95 out of 100 pairs of extension graphs, which aligns closely with the performance of the baseline models as detailed in Table 2. This demonstrates that our algorithm is competitive on the extension graphs.\nWe are actively exploring ways to optimize our method to handle such challenging graphs more effectively in future work.\n\n[1] Wang, Yanbo, et al.

We have carefully revised our manuscript to ensure that all important terms, including the HASH function (see below), are clearly defined. \n\n> **Q1**: “What is the HASH function? do you have an example of such a function?”\n\n**A1**: The term HASH function is standard in color refinement algorithms such as $r$-$\\ell{}$WL. It refers to any arbitrary injective function on multisets. In practice, one can use SHA-256 of the sorted multiset as an example. For the neural variant, $r$-$\\ell{}$GIN, the HASH function can be realized by summation followed by an MLP. We have added this clarification to the paper.\n\n> **Q2**: “Can you add tables concerning the times of your method compared to other methods?”\n\n**A2**: We have included tables comparing our methods to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of memory and runtime. Please refer to Table 9 for these comparisons. Please let us know if you are interested in any other specific comparison. We are happy to add more comparisons.\n\n> **Q3**: “What is the motivation behind using $r=5$ in the experiments? would any result in worse results or simply better results by small significance on the expense of might higher time?”\n\n**A3**: We chose $r=5$ because it matches the cycle-counting power of 3-WL. For the second question, please refer to Table 8, which compares predictive performance for ZINC12K when varying $r$. This table demonstrates that $r=5$ provides a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Increasing $r$ enhances the representation power and complexity of the model, which can negatively impact generalization performance. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between expressivity, computational cost, and generalization abilities. \nTo address the Reviewer's question more concretely, we tested a $12$-$\\ell{}$GIN on ZINC12K. This configuration resulted in a test MAE of $0.075\\pm0.003$, which is within the standard deviation of the performance of a $5$-$\\ell{}$GIN. The runtime increased by approximately 20%, which remains more efficient than other higher-order GNNs, such as those based on the $3$-WL test. We will include the results for $r=6,\\ldots,12$ in Tables 8 and 9.\n\n---\nThank you again for your valuable suggestions, which have helped improve the clarity and contribution of our work.

Our first preliminary results without any sweeping or positional encodings suggest improved performance over standard baseline:\n|  | Peptides Structural (MAE $\\downarrow$) | Peptides Functional (AP $\\uparrow$) |\n|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| GCN\t| 0.3496 ± 0.0013 | 59.30 ± 0.23 |\n| GINE\t| 0.3547 ± 0.004 | 54.98 ± 0.79 |\n| GatedGCN\t| 0.3420 ± 0.0013 | 58.64 ± 0.77 |\n|$r$-$\\ell{}$GIN\t| 0.2513 ± 0.0021 | 65.70 ± 0.60 |\n\nWe are happy to follow Reviewer pJ5G’s suggestion and update our manuscript with these experiments.\n\n> **Q**: “For any pair of non-isomorphic graph, can $r$-lwl differentiate them with large enough $r$?

It is indeed an open question and part of our ongoing research. While it is established that for every $k$, there exists an $r$ such that $r$-$\\ell$WL is not less powerful than $k$-WL (see Corollary 1 in our manuscript), this does not prove that increasing $r$ will enable $r$-$\\ell$WL to solve graph isomorphism universally. We conjecture that $k$-WL and $r$-$\\ell$WL are incomparable, where $r$ is chosen as described in Corollary 1. We acknowledge the complexity of this topic and appreciate the opportunity to explore it further.\n\n---\nThank you again for your insightful review and positive comments, especially regarding our work's strong theoretical contributions.

The paper overlooks this line of work and lacks comparison with $k$-OSANs, both empirically and theoretically. For example, specifying paths of length $r$ and a central node requires special subgraphs of size $r+1$ (the path plus central node), suggesting that $r$-$l$WL may be included in $(r+1)$-OSAN?

However, without sufficient 3D inductive bias, existing methods typically entail expensive training costs and struggle to extract high-quality 3D meshes. In this work, we introduce MeshFormer, a sparse-view reconstruction model that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, and training supervision. Specifically, instead of using a triplane representation, we store features in 3D sparse voxels and combine transformers with 3D convolutions to leverage an explicit 3D structure and projective bias. In addition to sparse-view RGB input, we require the network to take input and generate corresponding normal maps. The input normal maps can be predicted by 2D diffusion models, significantly aiding in the guidance and refinement of the geometry's learning. Moreover, by combining Signed Distance Function (SDF) supervision with surface rendering, we directly learn to generate high-quality meshes without the need for complex multi-stage training processes. By incorporating these explicit 3D biases, MeshFormer can be trained efficiently and deliver high-quality textured meshes with fine-grained geometric details. It can also be integrated with 2D diffusion models to enable fast single-image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks.

For example, before post-processing, only 26.4% of mesh vertices had a normal angle error of less than 2 degrees. After post-processing, this number increased to 40.8%. For a 10-degree threshold, the ratio increases from 78.8% to 86.4%. For more details, please refer to Table 4 in the rebuttal PDF. \n\nWe have also included qualitative examples to illustrate the importance of this post-processing module in recovering sharp geometric details and reducing noisy artifacts induced by the marching cubes algorithm.

Given the depth map (and even meshes), we can still apply direct 3D geometry supervision.

In fact, the loose thread is reconstructed by our MeshFormer. We have included additional views of our generated results (see Figure 1 of the rebuttal PDF), where the loose thread can be observed. You can check the video on our website.\n\nMeshFormer generates high-resolution (512) SDF volumes, which are sufficient to preserve very thin structures, as shown in Figure 2 of the rebuttal PDF.\n\n## The name ""VoxelFormer""\nThe meaning of ""VoxelFormer"" is two-fold. On the one hand, it refers to combining voxel representation and transformer layers, in contrast to recent LRM-based methods that rely on triplane representation and transformers to achieve scalability. On the other hand, it can also be interpreted as Voxel-Form-er, meaning the module that generates the voxels. We are open and happy to consider other names if the reviewer has more suitable suggestions.\n\n## Occlusion-aware feature aggregation\nWe agree that occlusion-aware feature aggregation is very important. This is the primary reason we use a cross-attention layer to aggregate the projected multi-view features instead of using a simple average or max pooling method like previous approaches. We hope the cross-attention layer can implicitly utilize prior knowledge of coarse structure and visibility to focus on the visible views. Our experiments also verify its superiority over mean pooling aggregation (Table 3 (d) of the paper). While we could explicitly filter out some views according to the predicted occupancy from the first stage, as the reviewer suggested, we would like to point out that the occupancy band has some thickness, and accurately determining the visibility of each voxel can be quite challenging. This may require more advanced techniques, and we leave this as a promising future direction.\n\n## Table 3 (d)\nWe followed the suggestion to add an ablation variant using the max-pooling aggregation mechanism (please refer to Table 1 of the rebuttal PDF). We found that while the max-pooling aggregation performs slightly better than average pooling, it is still significantly inferior to our projection-aware cross-attention mechanism.\n\nYes, we follow the ""skip-connection"" scheme of the typical UNet to concatenate the voxel features before the bottleneck with the voxel features after the bottleneck. If this is not what you are asking, please let us know.\n\n## Shared backbone and Plücker embedding\nYes, we use a shared backbone (trainable DINOv2) for both RGB and normal images. We did not use Plücker embedding in our experiments. Instead, we leveraged the camera poses to unproject 2D image features into 3D feature volumes.\n\n## Detailed description of the sparse VoxelFormer architecture\nYes, we will follow your suggestion to include more details about the Sparse VoxelFormer architecture in our revision, such as the number of sparse convolution layers used at each resolution.\n\n## Joint training\nYes, we began our experiments by training the dense model and sparse model separately. However, we found that this approach leads to a domain gap for the occupancy field during inference, as the predicted occupancy by the dense model may be imperfect, while the sparse model is only trained with ground truth occupancy. Joint training can mitigate this gap and reduce artifacts during inference.\n\n## Interpolation from $256^3$ to $512^3$\nThank you for pointing this out. We will add the missing description in our revision. Specifically, we generate a sparse feature volume with a resolution of 256, and then trilinearly interpolate it to a sparse feature volume with a resolution of 512. This interpolated sparse features are then fed into the SDF decoder for predicting SDF values, which are subsequently used to compute the loss against the 512-resolution ground truth SDF.\n\n## Multi-view normals for the teaser\nYes, we use GT multi-view normals for the teaser. We will make this clearer in our revision.\n\n## XCube\nThank you for pointing this out. We will cite XCube and discuss it in our revision. We agree that XCube shares many high-level ideas with us, such as hierarchical sparse voxel representation and coarse-to-fine generation. However, we would like to point out that they follow the paradigm of the 3D native diffusion, which can only generate geometry but fails to directly predict texture from the model. In contrast, we follow the paradigm of the feed-forward sparse-view reconstruction and incorporate differentiable rendering into the pipeline, which enables the network to directly generate high-quality texture. Additionally, we combine 3D (sparse) convolution with the transformer layer to increase capacity and scalability of the network, while they mainly rely on 3D convolution only and may be limited in both capacity and scalability.'}}, 'id': 'NvsADCR6Xm', 'forum': 'x7pjdDod6Z', 'replyto': 'W4hA3ADSDk', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/Official_Review5/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723016953707, 'cdate': 1723016953707, 'tmdate': 1730880736176, 'mdate': 1730880736176, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank all reviewers for their insightful comments and valuable suggestions.

In addition, we also include some qualitative examples with real-world input in our rebuttal PDF (see Fig. 3), where MeshFormer performs quite well. \n\nThe term \'open-world\' means that MeshFormer differs from many previous methods (such as A, B, C listed by the reviewer). Those methods are trained on datasets with a limited number of object categories (e.g., tens of categories in ShapeNet) and cannot generalize to novel categories. Unlike those methods (e.g., 3D native diffusion), MeshFormer takes as input sparse-view images and normal maps generated by 2D diffusion models, and demonstrates much stronger generalizability. MeshFormer is thus not limited to the training 3D dataset and can handle arbitrary object categories.\n\n# Ablation study of 2D model errors\nWe would like to clarify that, in Tab. 3 of the paper, we have analyzed the influence of errors from 2D normal models (rows f and g). Additionally, we provide some qualitative examples in Fig. 8.\n\nFor the effect of multi-view RGB, please compare Tab. 1, row ‘Ours’ (predicted RGB) and Tab. 3, row f (ground truth RGB) of the paper.\n\n# Claims about technical novelties\nThank you for pointing this out. We will cite these prior works and discuss the differences in our revision. We fully understand your concerns and would like to address the potential misunderstanding in detail.\n\n## Point 1\n\n The reviewer summarized that the ""primary contribution lies in adopting a voxel-based 3D representation and employing a network architecture …."" **We respectfully disagree with this argument.** Our main claim is that by proposing a 3D-guided reconstruction model that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, and training supervision, MeshFormer can significantly improve both mesh quality and training efficiency. Our main findings/contributions include:\n\n- (a) Using normal images as additional input in feed-forward reconstruction models greatly enhances the prediction of geometric details.\n   \n- (b) Proposing to learn and output a 3D normal map, which can be used for further geometric detail enhancement.\n   \n- (c) Combining SDF loss and rendering losses in training feed-forward reconstruction models enables a unified single-stage training process. In contrast, concurrent works rely on complex multi-stage ""NeRF-to-Mesh"" training strategies to export high-quality meshes (e.g., MeshLRM, InstantMesh) and struggle to generate high-quality geometry.\n   \n- (d) Explicitly leveraging 3D native voxel representation, network architecture, and projective priors fosters faster convergence speeds and significantly reduces the training requirement. \n\n**We would like to emphasize that all four points are crucial to MeshFormer.  We thus do not agree that our primary contribution lies solely or primarily in adopting 3D representation and network architecture.** For example, without points (a), (b), and (c), our mesh quality would be significantly compromised. \n\n## Point 2\nWe totally agree that the utilization of 3D voxel representation is common in general 3D generation. However, **all works listed by the reviewer (A-E) focus on 3D native diffusion, one of the paradigms in 3D generation, which differs from the route of MeshFormer.** There are some common limitations of this line of work. For instance, all of A-E focus on geometry generation only and cannot predict high-quality texture directly from the network. Also, due to the limited amount of 3D data, 3D native diffusion methods typically struggle with open-world capability and focus on closed-domain datasets (e.g., ShapeNet) in their experiments (A, B, C).\n\nIn MeshFormer, **we aim to achieve direct high-quality texture generation and handle arbitrary object categories**. We are thus following another route: sparse-view feed-forward reconstruction, instead of the 3D native diffusion. In this specific task setting, **many of the works provided by the reviewer are not suitable for comparison in our experiments**. More comparable works are recent LRM-style methods (e.g., InstantMesh, MeshLRM, LGM, TripoSR, etc). However, **most of them only utilize the combination of triplane representation and large-scale transformers**. \n\nIn our paper, we do not claim to be the first to use voxel representation in 3D generation. Instead, we would like to share our findings:\n\n- In this specific task setting (open-world sparse-view reconstruction with feed-forward textures), we are not limited to the triplane representation. 3D native structures (voxels), network architectures, and projective priors can facilitate more efficient training and significantly reduce the training resources required (from over one hundred GPUs to only 8 GPUs).\n- In this specific task setting, we require a scalable network to learn a lot of priors. However, not only triplane-based transformers can be scalable. When marrying the 3D convolution with transformer layers, it can also be scalable. \n- In addition to using 3D native representation and networks in 3D native diffusion, we can also combine them with differentiable rendering to train a feed-forward sparse-view reconstruction model with rendering losses.\n- For image conditioning, C and E only take a single image as a condition. D **first employs max pooling across multi-view features** and then uses cross-attention across the pooled multi-view features and the voxel feature. The max pooling is typically affected by occlusion (voxels are not visible in all views) and thus becomes less effective. Instead, we propose using cross-attention across all multi-view projected image features and voxel features, which can implicitly leverage structure and visibility priors to focus only on visible regions. We demonstrate that this strategy is more efficient than the pooling strategies used in D as shown in Tab. 3 of the paper and Tab. 1 of the rebuttal PDF.'}}, 'id': 'UgrNCHHhiQ', 'forum': 'x7pjdDod6Z', 'replyto': 'U9Seowt9eX', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723016299959, 'cdate': 1723016299959, 'tmdate': 1730880735882, 'mdate': 1730880735882, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'In this work, the authors propose MeshFormer, a sparse-view reconstruction model that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, and training supervision.

However, without sufficient 3D inductive bias, existing methods typically entail expensive training costs and struggle to extract high-quality 3D meshes. In this work, we introduce MeshFormer, a sparse-view reconstruction model that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, and training supervision. Specifically, instead of using a triplane representation, we store features in 3D sparse voxels and combine transformers with 3D convolutions to leverage an explicit 3D structure and projective bias. In addition to sparse-view RGB input, we require the network to take input and generate corresponding normal maps. The input normal maps can be predicted by 2D diffusion models, significantly aiding in the guidance and refinement of the geometry's learning. Moreover, by combining Signed Distance Function (SDF) supervision with surface rendering, we directly learn to generate high-quality meshes without the need for complex multi-stage training processes. By incorporating these explicit 3D biases, MeshFormer can be trained efficiently and deliver high-quality textured meshes with fine-grained geometric details. It can also be integrated with 2D diffusion models to enable fast single-image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks. **Videos are available at https://meshformer3d.github.io/**""}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/0137993914b1c34b105ba8ce5545d99389e3b12a.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\nliu2024meshformer,\ntitle={MeshFormer : High-Quality Mesh Generation with 3D-Guided Reconstruction Model},\nauthor={Minghua Liu and Chong Zeng and Xinyue Wei and Ruoxi Shi and Linghao Chen and Chao Xu and Mengqi Zhang and Zhaoning Wang and Xiaoshuai Zhang and Isabella Liu and Hongzhi Wu and Hao Su},\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=x7pjdDod6Z}\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'liu|meshformer_highquality_mesh_generation_with_3dguided_reconstruction_model'}}, 'id': 'x7pjdDod6Z', 'forum': 'x7pjdDod6Z', 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/Authors'], 'number': 2381, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1715060312325, 'cdate': 1715060312325, 'tmdate': 1730873857622, 'mdate': 1730873857622, 'pdate': 1727287688948, 'odate': 1730873857607, 'version': 2}]"

We focus on exchangeable data satisfying an assumption of independent causal mechanisms. Traditional causal effect estimation frameworks, e.g., relying on structural causal models and do-calculus, are typically limited to i.i.d. data and do not extend to more general exchangeable generative processes, which naturally arise in multi-environment data. To address this gap, we develop a generalized framework for exchangeable data and introduce a truncated factorization formula that facilitates both the identification and estimation of causal effects in our setting. To illustrate potential applications, we introduce a causal Pólya urn model and demonstrate how intervention propagates effects in exchangeable data settings. Finally, we develop an algorithm that performs simultaneous causal discovery and effect estimation given multi-environment data.","Oral Session 5B: Graph Neural Networks, Causal Inference",https://openreview.net/pdf?id=4rCZeCZAON,https://openreview.net/forum?id=4rCZeCZAON,4rCZeCZAON,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Reviewers were agreed in their support for accepting this paper, praising the topic, the strength of the results, and the clarity of presentation (particularly in the early parts of the paper).

So the theoretical improvement seems not much.\n\nIndeed, many i.i.d. results transfer to the exchangeable case, however, the situation is more complex. Aldous (1985) presents a lecture on exchangeability in probability theory, covering topics such as de Finetti’s theorem, its consequences, extensions, analogues, distributions invariant under group transformations, and exchangeable sets. However, Aldous (1985) does not focus on causality. Our work shows that causal effect estimation in certain types of non-IID data (specifically those meeting an ICM assumption) enables us to draw conclusions that cannot be inferred from IID data alone. \n\n> Only simulated experiments for the casual inference problems.\n\nThe experiments are designed to show that the truncated factorization formula developed for i.i.d. data fails to apply for exchangeable non-i.i.d. data even given knowledge of the true graph. Fig. 4 shows even with near infinite data, the dotted blue line (i.i.d. with the true graph) cannot reach 0 mean squared error in contrast to do-finetti with the true graph. The simulated experiment thus merely creates a controlled setup to demonstrate that conclusions in i.i.d. (e.g. truncated formula) fail to apply for exchangeable non-i.i.d. data. \n\n> De Finetti Theorem is ‘iff’. So it is inappropriate to use methods based on iid settings on the exchangeable but not iid data to compare.\n\nWe agree. The standard i.i.d. methods aren’t appropriate. Maybe we have not expressed this well, and a statement akin to the above would help put the experiment in perspective? \n\n> For the experiment, what about the larger number of environment? It seems the original one performs better.\n\nWe are confused with the statement. In Figure 4 (both left and right), we observe that do-Finetti algorithm outperforms the i.i.d. baseline in the large number of environments. The left plots show that do Finetti achieves near zero mean squared error in causal effect estimation compared to the i.i.d. baseline which has high errors. The right plot also shows that do Finetti simultaneously identifies the correct graph in contrast to the i.i.d. baseline with low graph accuracy. \n\n> 5. In causal inference problems, is it easy to identify the exchangeability, especially for the real data?\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the question. There might be empirical tests one could run based on permutations and there exists some work for testing exchangeability in real-world data, e.g., [1], [2]. Likely, this may not be a closed question, especially in terms of causal inference and exchangeability. Though we’d hope to leverage the above work as a promising first step to study it for future directions. \n\n> 6.

For example, the use of index i in equation 51, 53, ...\n\nThank you for pointing out the typos, we will correct them in next version. \n\n> In the experiments, it seems to me that the model generating the synthetic dataset is different from that described in section 3.2. In particular, in the experiments, X_i is sampled from a Ber(theta) and hence P(X_i = 1) = P(X_2 =1) = ... = theta, whereas if I understood the model in 3.2, then the probability P(X_n =1) will be much greater than P(X_1 =1) if for example all X_m =1 for all m < n. Are they actually different? Or did I misunderstood? And how can the model described in 3.2 be represented by equation 4? (I read F.2 but it seems to me that equation 51 follows the model in Section 5).\n\nThe model described in 3.2 can be represented by equation 4, because Appendix F.2 shows that the joint distribution $P(x1, y1, x2, y2, …) $ in the causal Pólya urn model can be modelled as  $\\int \\int \\prod_i p(y_i | x_i, \\psi) p(x_i | \\theta) p(\\theta) p(\\psi) d\\theta d\\psi$, where $p(\\theta), p(\\psi)$ are beta-distributions and $p(x_i | \\theta), p(y_i | x_i, \\psi)$ are Bernoulli distributions. This corresponds to equation 4 as this is the equivalent bivariate version where X is the parent of Y, and $\\theta, \\psi$ are statistically independent $\\theta_i$’s in equation 4. Therefore as equation 51 follows the model in section 5 (as the reviewer suggested) and it is the representation for the causal Pólya urn model (due to the arguments above and in Appendix F.2), we argue that it is the same as the one described in section 3.2. We hope it clarifies things and thank you for going into the Appendix. \n\n> In the experiments, can the authors elaborate on the IID baseline? Do you run the algorithm on the ""full"" graph G which have nodes X_1 Y_1 X_2 Y_2?\n\nThe IID baseline is taking into account the full graph x1, x2, y1, y2 and treats the variables as $(x_i, y_i) \\sim_{i.i.d.} (X, Y)$. This means there are no bi-directed edges connecting X1, X2 and Y1, Y2. The causal effect estimand for the i.i.d. case is analogous to Eq. 10. The experiment is designed to show that the truncated factorization developed for i.i.d. data indeed does not apply for exchangeable non-i.i.d. data, hence the need for the generalised truncated factorization introduced in Theorem 1. \n\n> In the description of ICMs, the author mention the expression:\nCausal mechanisms are independent of each other in the sense that a change in one mechanism P(Xi | PAi) does not inform or influence any of the other mechanisms P(Xj | PAj) What would be a concrete example where such condition is violated?\n\nThis condition will be violated when we decompose a distribution into non-causal conditionals. For example, suppose that for weather stations, altitude (A) causes temperature (T) but not vice versa, i.e. building a greenhouse effect on top of a mountain will not increase the height of the mountain. In that case, P(T | A) and P(A) will be independent causal mechanisms that can be changed independently in the generative process, but P( A | T) and P(T) will not be. This is described in more detail for instance in Peters et al., Elements of Causal Inference. The causal de Finetti theorem formalises ICM mathematically: suppose $\\theta$ represents a mountain and $\\psi$ represents seasons. With random measurements given fixed mountain and season, we have $T_i, A_i$. The causal de Finetti theorem says $A \\to T$ characterizes by $T_1 \\perp A_2 | A_1$. Equivalently, it means $P(T_1 | A_1, A_2) = P(T_1 | A_1)$, i.e. knowing the altitude of measurements in other locations will not help the prediction of the temperature measured at location 1. If $T \\to A$, causal de Finetti theorem says $A_1 \\perp T_2 | T_1$, equivalently expressed as $P(A_1 | T_1, T_2) = P(A_1 | T_1)$. However we know it does not hold as if $T_1 = -10$, and $T_2 = 30$, then one can infer it is likely to be in hot season and given observed a low temperature $T_1$, one could infer $A_1$ will be high in altitude.\n\n[1] Guo, S., Tóth, V., Schölkopf, B. and Huszár, F., 2024.

Recently, an approach for learning logic gate networks directly via a differentiable relaxation was proposed. Logic gate networks are faster than conventional neural network approaches because their inference only requires logic gate operators such as NAND, OR, and XOR, which are the underlying building blocks of current hardware and can be efficiently executed. We build on this idea, extending it by deep logic gate tree convolutions, logical OR pooling, and residual initializations. This allows scaling logic gate networks up by over one order of magnitude and utilizing the paradigm of convolution.

Figure 1. [...] Figure 2. [...] Figure 3. [...]\n\nThank you for each of these helpful suggestions. We will incorporate them into Figures 1, 2, and 3, as well as their captions.\n\n> Some technical questions need to be better explained.\n> L114-115, why are vanilla LGNs ""very computationally expensive to train""? [...]\n\nThe primary reason for vanilla LGNs to be very computationally expensive to train is that they are bottlenecked by memory and cache read and write accesses during training.\nIn contrast, by utilizing the proposed convolutional structure, the parameter sharing enables loading fewer parameters into a cache that is shared between different cores of the GPU, requiring reading only once.\nMoreover, by fusing the tree structure, and not storing any intermediate results in memory, expensive global memory writes are drastically minimized. If $d=2$ and we have a maxpool of $2\\times 2$ fused to it, then 15 logic gates are executed during forward, and only a single output activation has to be stored. While this requires recomputation of intermediate results during backward, only one out of four paths through the pooling needs to be backpropagated through, and the choice of this path requires storing only 2 bits. This, combined, leads to a much higher utilization of the memory bandwidth, while at the same time reducing memory access requirements, and drastically improving the utilization of actual compute units in the GPU.\nFurthermore, the sparsity pattern as introduced by using convolutions is also more favorable for memory accesses.\n\nBeyond this, we have made contributions to faster training of vanilla LGNs, and, e.g., reduced memory access from reading 18 floats down to reading 6 floats by precomputing coefficients in a simplification of Eq. (1). In particular, Eq. (1) can be rewritten as $u_0 \\cdot a_1 + u_1 \\cdot a_2 + u_2 \\cdot a_1 \\cdot a_2 + u_3 \\cdot 1$ for a certain set of $u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3$, which we precompute in a separate kernel, and thus only have to compute once for the entire batch. This constitutes another fundamental speedup that applies to both vanilla LGNs and convolutional LGNs, reducing both memory and compute requirements.\n\n> I noticed that in the design of the network, the authors chose a relatively small depth but large channels (2 vs 40,400,2000+). Is there any intuitive reason to do so? How many layers (depth) does vanilla LGN have?\n\nThe intuitive reason for the large number of channels compared to the depth is that the network is very sparse and only uses logic, and thus the expressivity of each channel is smaller (compared to a conventional CNN).  Thus the model requires more channels in order to attain high overall expressivity.\n\nThe depth of 2 that you mention refers to the depth of each convolutional block. With 4 convolutional blocks and 2 randomly connected layers for the head, the total trainable depth of our model is 10 layers. Including the or-pooling, we have a total of 18 layers.\n\nThe best performance with vanilla LGNs is achieved with 4-6 layers. [7] reported trying up to 8 layers, and from our own experiments we can confirm that vanilla LGNs with 8 or more layers converge extremely slowly and to lower accuracies. The best vanilla LGN MNIST model uses 6 layers and the best vanilla LGN CIFAR-10 model uses 5 layers. The best vanilla LGN for CIFAR-10 requires 1,024,000 neurons per layer.\n\nThus, our CIFAR-10 model has 2x the trainable depth and 3.6x the total depth compared to the vanilla LGN, while having substantially fewer channels.\n\n\n> The authors have implemented CUDA kernel, but in the speed comparison (Table 2), the results are from Xilinx FPGA (I guess only has CPU). Why didn\'t the authors implement experiments on GPU? Is it for fair comparison w/ others? Maybe I missed something, but on CPU, what\'s the advantage of implementing CUDA kernel？\n\nTo clarify, while all training is performed on GPU (as it requires float operations), the inference is performed on FPGAs or CPUs as it only requires bitwise logical operations.\nWhile we could have also run inference on GPU, GPUs are highly optimized for float operations and rather neglect bitwise logics; further, for GPUs the speed of transferring input data would be the bottleneck.\nAs FPGAs are effectively slow proxies of ASICs, utilized in hardware design, they are the closest one can get to ASICs without actually manufacturing ASICs.\n\n> The authors could provide a paragraph discussing their potential limitation to solving more complex CV tasks involving continuous decisions. E.g., regressing boundaries of bounding boxes (Object Detection/Tracking), localization and mapping (SLAM), generative CV, etc.\n\nIndeed, we have not explored CV tasks involving continuous decisions.\nContinuous decisions, as the ones listed, are a great direction for future work, and we have included a paragraph in the camera-ready to highlight this.'}}, 'id': '5rLbdzbfqm', 'forum': '4bKEFyUHT4', 'replyto': 'HUHvDhlKOc', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723031835974, 'cdate': 1723031835974, 'tmdate': 1730880355696, 'mdate': 1730880355696, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thank you very much for your extensive and positive feedback.\nWe greatly appreciate that you find our result of importance to embedded and real-time machine learning applications.\nThank you also for your praises wrt. coverage of related work, our technical soundness, our ablation studies, discussions of tradeoffs, detailed descriptions, and the insights into methodology choices that we provide.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n> Lack of statistical significance measures for results.

To this end, is the z vector optimized taking the partial derivative of z on the classification loss? Introducing some details on the optimization process will be useful.\n\nYes, the vectors $z$ are optimized by taking the derivative of $z$ on the classification loss. \nThese vectors $z$ are the logits of the probability distributions over choices of logic gates, and can be mapped to those probabilites via softmax (Eq. 1). Accordingly, we do not use a projection layer. We will add clarifications to the camera-ready.\n\n> The random selection of inputs on the receptive fields raises concerns regarding the consistency of the training process, with the paper not providing error bars regarding different training runs.\n> \n> I would like to stress the consistency of the proposed method in different training runs due to the fact that it is based on the random selection of inputs of the receptive field.

After training, each gate is discretized to a single parameter, i.e., the choice of logic gate. Finally, during the simplification process, depending on the exact model, 60-80% of the logic gates are removed.\n\n> How do the authors comment on the observation that the proposed method seems to not generalize equally well to smaller architectures?\n> \n> The proposed method leads to lower accuracies in smaller models (e.x. LogicTreeNet-S of the table 1)\n\nFirst, we would like to state that we designed each of our models based on model size ""L"".\nThus, for the smallest model, in order to match the number of logic gates with the baselines, we had to drastically reduce the number of channels down to 40, which was not the optimal model for the small size, but maintained for consistency.\n\n> Taking into account that they promote logic gate choice A, it would be very interesting if the authors report the per layer distribution of logic gates after the training. This could be interesting also in contrast to Gaussian initialization.\n\nThank you for this request.

Additional simplifications are also possible, e.g., ""True and B"" -> ""B"".\nAs Vivado optimizes for 6-LUTs, we could not read out the number of ASIC gates.\nAs there were no open-source libraries for logic gate network simplification that scale to our model, we developed our own stack, which at the time of writing only supported CIFAR. \nNow, it also supports MNIST, and we can report more accurate numbers of ASIC gates for MNIST:\n\n| MNIST | # Gates (prev.) | # Gates (new) |\n|--|--|--|\n| LTNet-S | 296 K | 197 K |\n| LTNet-L | 4.74 M | 671 K | \n\n(The actual number of logic gates will still be lower than this number.)\n\n> Are any additional resources of the FPGA device being used?\n\nSo far, we only utilize Logic Cells and Flip Flops to keep it as close as possible to efficient ASIC designs.\n\n> Table 5 [...] ""No or pooling"".

For our models, we count the 4-input OR gate as 3 gates to have a conservative estimate that applies independently of the hardware.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n> Despite improved training and inference efficiency, experimental results are limited [...] scalability\n\nThanks for the questions.

We evaluate our framework and baseline methods using state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of real-world medical knowledge and clinical diagnosis benchmarks, including a comparison ofLLMs’ medical complexity classification against human physicians. MDAgents achieved the **best performance in seven out of ten** benchmarks on tasks requiring an understanding of medical knowledge and multi-modal reasoning, showing a significant **improvement of up to 4.2\%** ($p$ < 0.05) compared to previous methods' best performances. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents effectively determines medical complexity to optimize for efficiency and accuracy across diverse medical tasks. Notably, the combination of moderator review and external medical knowledge in group collaboration resulted in an average accuracy **improvement of 11.8\%**.

We initially considered using a different number of exemplars to calibrate our implementations further. However, we chose a smaller number due to the increased cost and time required for comprehensive testing. Under similar conditions, such as using more exemplars like [1], we anticipate that our MDAgents and other baseline methods might also demonstrate improved performance.\nWe will ensure these distinctions in the implementations are clearly outlined in our paper to provide proper context for the reported results.\n\n**W2. What is the correlation between LLM complexity scores and human Physician\'s judgments?**\n\nWe have addressed this in the general response by detailing a study where three human physicians annotated question complexity and conducted a correlation analysis with LLM assessments.\n\n**W3 & Q2. Figure 3 and 5 confusing and what if we remove LLM complexity checker in the ablation?**\n\nFor Figure 5, ""Low,"" ""Moderate,"" and ""High"" denote the performance outcomes when all questions in the dataset are manually set into each respective complexity category, rather than relying on the complexity obtained by the LLM complexity checker. This means:\n\n* **""Low""** shows the accuracy when all questions are set to low complexity.\n* **""Moderate""** indicates the accuracy when all questions are set to moderate complexity.\n* **""High""** reflects the accuracy when all questions are set to high complexity.\n\nThis setup was designed to evaluate how the model\'s performance varies when operating under uniform complexity assumptions across the dataset. We will ensure that the figure description and ablation setup in our paper (Section 4.3) are updated to clearly explain this methodology. \n\n**W4. Studies on other medical agents should also be discussed**\n\nWe will include a discussion of the study [1] suggested and others [2,3,4,5] to better contextualize our work and clarify how MDAgents compare with existing approaches in medical decision-making.\n\n**Q1. What is the relative cost of MDAgents vs. gpt-4 zero-shot CoT on each dataset**\n\nAs detailed in Table 3 of the attached pdf file, MDAgents require higher costs across the datasets compared to Zero-shot CoT. Our methods use a 3-shot setting across different medical complexities and recruit multiple agents, which are needed to effectively handle the complexity of medical datasets which contributes to the enhanced performance.\n\n**Q3. Need to aggregate GPT-3.5 results in Table 3**\n\nWe will aggregate the GPT-3.5 results into the main results table for clarity and easier comparison with other models.\n\n**L1. Evaluations limited to multi-choice question tasks which is not a realistic medical setting**\n\nTo address the issue, we conducted additional experiments using the MedQA dataset without predefined options, aiming to better mirror the open-ended nature of clinical decision-making.\n\nRecognizing that real-world medical scenarios often involve complex, multi-turn interactions, we are committed to refining our evaluation methods to more accurately simulate actual clinical conditions. In our latest experiments with the gpt-4o-mini model, we evaluated our method alongside 3-shot CoT-SC and Reconcile, using 100 samples from the MedQA dataset in an open-ended format. The results were as follows:\n\n* **3-shot CoT-SC:** 52 % accuracy\n* **Reconcile:** 40 % accuracy\n* **Ours:** 56 % accuracy\n\nThese results indicate that our approach performs competitively even in more realistic settings, underscoring its potential in clinical applications. We are open to further suggestions and welcome any recommendations for additional datasets or evaluation frameworks that could enhance the realism and robustness of our assessments.\n\nWe believe our responses have addressed your concerns and provided clarity. Please let us know if you require any additional information or further clarifications for your re-evaluation.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Nori, H., Lee, Y.

The complexity assessment lacks details and concerns about judgment made by the moderator agent may propagate.**\n\nWe address this issue in Section 4.3 through an ablation study, the results of which are presented in Figure 5. This study evaluates the effectiveness of our adaptive complexity selection mechanism against static assignments across different modalities.\n\nOur findings indicate that the adaptive method significantly outperforms static settings, demonstrating robustness in our approach to complexity assessment and reducing the potential for error propagation.

Is assigning an agent a role enough for LLMs to act like experts? What if equipping different knowledge with RAG?**\n\nThank you for your idea about the knowledge initialization for agents using RAG in our MDAgents framework. To address your point on domain expertise, we conducted extra experiments on top of Table 3:\n\nMDAgents: 71.8%\n \n \\+ MedRAG: 75.2% \n\n \\+ Medical Knowledge Initialization: 76.0% (**your suggestion**)\n\n \\+ Moderator’s Review: 77.6%\n\n \\+ Moderator’s Review & MedRAG: 80.3%\n\nThese results indicate that augmenting agents with specific knowledge and structured reviews have potential to improve their ability to simulate domain expertise. We will detail these findings in our revised manuscript.\n\n**Q2. Doubts on Complexity Labels and Optimistic Accuracy Claims in Figure 3**\n\nTo re-explain Figure 3, we need to explain why this experiment is needed, which will help to understand the meaning of Figure 3. \n\nIt is important to accurately assign difficulty levels to medical questions. For instance, if a medical question is obviously easy, utilizing a team of specialists (such as an Interdisciplinary Doctor Team, IDT) might be excessive and potentially lead to overly pessimistic approaches. Conversely, if a difficult medical question is only tackled by a PCP, the problem might not be adequately addressed.\n\nThe core issue here is the LLM\'s capability to classify the difficulty of medical questions appropriately. If an LLM inaccurately classifies the difficulty level, the chosen medical solution may not be suitable, potentially leading to the wrong decision making. Therefore, understanding what constitutes an appropriate difficulty level is essential.\n\nWe hypothesize that the appropriate difficulty for each question corresponds to the difficulty level at which the probability of correctly solving the question is highest, as we cannot incorporate doctor in the difficulty decision making (while we also have ablation studies with human doctors as well) \n\nTo determine this, we assessed the accuracy of solutions across various difficulty levels. Specifically, we evaluated 10 medical problems (increased to 25 after rebuttals) by solving each problem 10 times at each difficulty level. By measuring the success rate, we aimed to identify the difficulty level that yielded the highest accuracy.\n\nThis rigorous approach ensures that the LLM\'s classification of problem difficulty aligns with the most effective and accurate medical solutions, thereby optimizing the application of medical expertise to each question.\n\nGoing back to Reviewer mJeV’s question, \n>The observation that questions labeled as ""Low"" complexity have lower accuracy rates than ""Moderate"" ones in Figure 3 casts doubt on the reliability of the moderator\'s assessment. \n\nIt is important to clarify that Figure 3(b) does not indicate specific questions labeled as ""Low"" complexity. Instead, it shows the probability that the LLM can correctly answer questions when c our “Low Complexity” solution is applied for **all questions**. This explanation extends to Figures 3(c) and 3(d) as well. Figure 3(a), on the other hand, illustrates whether the LLM is choosing the difficulty level that provides the highest accuracy.\n\n> Also, the reasoning claim that the complexity assessment can increase accuracy by at least 80% is way more optimistic and seems like a really bold statement to me.\n\nWe did not make such a claim. Our assertion is that the LLM is automatically selecting the appropriate difficulty level with an accuracy rate close to 80%.\n\n**Q3. Why does assigning high complexity to all queries reduce accuracy and increase API costs?**\n\nTo address this issue, we conducted additional experiments to see if we missed the benefit to improve the performance in high complexity cases.\n\nFor the image+text scenario, we explored various collaborative settings and found these outcomes:\n\n* Sequential & No Discussion: 39.0%\n\n* Sequential & Discussion: 45.0%\n\n* Parallel & No Discussion: 56.0%\n\n* Parallel & Discussion: 59.0%\n\nThis indicates the importance of multi-turn discussions, particularly in complex cases and the exclusion of this feature likely contributed to lower performance.\n\nWe hope our detailed responses have addressed your concerns effectively.

We have conducted numerous additional experiments to validate our approach and enhance the robustness of our findings.\n\n**W1. The description of MDT and ICT is unclear.**\n \n* **Agent Initialization:** In our framework, the roles and descriptions for specialists within the MDT and ICT are dynamically determined by a specialized recruiter LLM. This process automates the generation of role-specific prompts, ensuring each agent is precisely tailored to the demands of the case. \n\n* **Hierarchy Explanation:** The hierarchical configuration in MDT and ICT, as depicted in Figure 10 (c-d), is inspired by traditional clinical reporting structures. This protocol ensures structured communication flow and oversight, preventing information discrepancies and fostering coherent team collaboration.\n\n**W2. Experiment shown in Figure 3 with only 10 questions not convincing**\n\nWe acknowledge the limitation of using only 10 questions in Figure 3. Initially, we had 10 questions because this already required generating 300 question-answer pairs (10 solutions * 3 difficulty levels * 10 questions). However, with the current significant reduction in price offered by gpt-4o-mini, we added 15 more questions which results in 750 question-answer pairs.\n\nWe will expand our experiments to include more questions from multiple datasets to provide a more robust evaluation.\n\n**W3. The results in Figure 5 seem counterintuitive**\n\nIn response to your concerns, we have conducted additional experiments and analyses to clarify these outcomes.\n\nFor the image+text scenario, further experiments with different settings has revealed the following results:\n\n* Sequential & No Discussion: 39.0%\n* Sequential & Discussion: 45.0%\n* Parallel & No Discussion: 56.0%\n* Parallel & Discussion: 59.0%\n\nThese results suggest that the integration of multi-turn discussions substantially benefits the decision-making process, particularly in complex cases. The initial absence of this feature in our methodology likely contributed to the earlier lower performance figures.\n\nFor the video+text scenario, the use of the deprecated gemini-pro vision model initially restricted multi-turn chats (multi-modal cases). By summarizing the video content with one agent and then re-initializing another for further multi-turn discussions, we attempted to overcome this limitation. We assume that this approach might have influenced the accuracy in the moderate and high complexity scenarios.\n\nTo thoroughly address these issues and refine our understanding, we plan to further conduct detailed experiments focused on:\n\n* Investigating the impact of different agent initialization strategies on the consistency and accuracy of outcomes (with gemini-1.5 flash).\n\nWe will ensure that these additional analyses are included in the revised manuscript for the camera-ready version, aiming to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between model capabilities and task complexities.\n\n**W4. Need to Compare Moderator's Review and RAG Integration with Other Multi-Agent Frameworks to Demonstrate Suitability**\n \nOur primary focus was on demonstrating how the MDAgents framework can enhance medical decision-making through adaptive collaboration structures with initial complexity classification. The inclusion of the moderator's review and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Table 3 was intended to show the potential improvements in accuracy when integrating external knowledge sources and structured review processes.\n\nWhile we recognize that the moderator's review and RAG could be applied to other multi-agent frameworks, our aim was to illustrate their effectiveness specifically within MDAgents. However, it's important to note that RAG itself is not a medical-specific technique. We focused on demonstrating how the integration of RAG and structured reviews can be particularly effective within a medical-aware structured adaptive multi-agent system compared to a naive multi-agent system.\n\n**Q1. Discuss more about the motivation behind the design of PCP, MDT, and ICT, and why doesn't ICT include multi-turn discussions?**\n\nThe design of PCP, MDT and ICT represents the real-world clinical decision making processes which is mostly dependent on the complexity of the medical cases (refer to Appendix Section D.1.1. for real-world examples). If the case or task is with low complexity where PCP could solve it without consulting specialists (Case 1, Appendix D.1.1), if it is moderate complexity PCP might have to consult to a specialist agents (Case 2, Appendix D.1.1.), and lastly if the case is complex so that it involves multi-disciplinary consult (Case 3, Appendix D.1.1) we let multidisciplinary agents interact with one another.\n\n**Additional experimental results with ICT setting (Accuracy):**\n\n* Sequential report generation w/ discussion: 84%\n* Sequential report generation w/o discussion: 78% (Our previous approach)\n* Parallel report generation w/ discussion: 82%\n* Parallel report generation w/o discussion: 80%\n\nThe results indicate that incorporating discussions among lead clinicians in ICT enhances decision-making accuracy, particularly in sequential report generation. This evidence supports your point that complex cases benefit from more extensive deliberation.\n\nIn the updated manuscript, we will adjust the ICT model to include more robust discussion protocols.\n\n**Q2 & Q3. The order of Table 3 Appearing Before Figure 5 confuses readers and Table 3 violates NeurIPS 2024 formatting rules**\n\nIn the final version, we will ensure that the figures and tables are presented in the same order as they are discussed in the text to enhance clarity for the readers and revise it to comply with the guidelines in the updated manuscript.\n\nWe believe our extensive additional experiments and clarifications have addressed your queries.

Your insights are invaluable in guiding us to enhance our work and clarify the findings.\n\n**W1. & Q2. Lack of detailed descriptions and examples**\n\nWe recognize the importance of providing more detailed descriptions to clarify our methods, particularly in the areas of multi-party chat, collaboration, and report generation. In the revised version, we will enhance our explanations and include visual aids for better understanding.\n\n* **Number of Agents:** We will explain in Section 3.4 how the recruiter LLM determines the optimal number of agents, considering task complexity and expertise, as outlined in Appendix C.2.\n\n* **Report Generation:** We will expand on the report generation process in Section 3.4 by including the specific prompt used and detailing how information is synthesized from multiple agents, building on the example in Figure 12.\n\n* **Multi-Party Chat and Collaboration:** We will provide a more comprehensive description of agent interactions and collaboration dynamics in the main text, focusing on their role in fostering effective teamwork, as illustrated in Figure 11.\n\n**W2. & Q1. Why use only 50 samples in the experiments?**\n\nWe selected 50 samples to maintain consistency with similar studies, such as [1], which employ a sample size 50 for evaluation. This decision was made to ensure a manageable yet statistically significant analysis with three random seeds, aligning with our experiment budget constraints (experiments cost listed in Table 3 in attached pdf file).\n\nIn our experiments, we utilized the gpt-4 (vision) model, which is approximately up to 200 times more expensive than the gpt-4o-mini model. Given this consideration, we increased the number of samples to 100 with gpt-4o-mini and reproduced our experimental results to provide a more comprehensive evaluation (Table 1 in attached pdf file).\n\nIn particular, for MedQA, we evaluated the entire test set to demonstrate that performance trends remain consistent across different models, thus reinforcing the reliability of our findings (Table 2 in attached pdf file). We believe this approach balances practical constraints with the need for rigorous evaluation and hope this addresses your concerns.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that our use of multiple datasets reflects our intention to test the multi-agent system across various medical scenarios, acknowledging the diversity and complexity of medical diagnostics. By selecting a smaller number of samples from each of the ten datasets, we aim to capture a broad spectrum of medical conditions and scenarios, making our study comparative and comprehensive relative to others..\n\nLastly, the percentage that these 100 samples represent of the total test set sizes varies, which can be calculated based on Table 5 in our Appendix:\n\n* MedQA: 0.0078%\n* PubMedQA: 20%\n* DDXPlus: 0.074%\n* SymCat: 0.027%\n* JAMA: 6.56%\n* MedBullets: 32.47%\n* MIMIC-CXR: 6.53%\n* PMC-VQA: 200%\n* Path-VQA: 0.00295%\n* MedVidQA: 64.52%\n\n**W3. & Q7. Details missing in evaluation setup and prompting strategies**\n\nIn our framework, we employed a 3-shot setting for low-complexity cases where PCP agents make decisions. For moderate and high-complexity cases involving multi-LLM agents, we used a zero-shot setting. We will update our experimental setup in the revised paper to clearly indicate where zero-shot and few-shot prompting are used, and we will add this notation to the relevant figures. \n\n**Q3. Is expert discussion one-to-one?**\n\nIn our implementation, we allowed the LLMs to decide if they wanted to engage with other agents. Rather than limiting interactions to one-to-one, we facilitated many-to-many discussions, where multiple agents could interact simultaneously. We will add more detailed descriptions in Section 3.4 and clarify this aspect in Figure 2.\n\n**Q4. How does the system dynamically calibrate expert teams for high severity cases?**\n\nThe system dynamically calibrates expert teams based on the complexity of the medical query. Initially, the recruiter LLM determines the number of agents allocated to each team. For the meta-analysis, we fixed the number of agents to assess the impact on performance, rather than allowing the recruiter LLM to decide dynamically. In our implementation, instead of removing the agents during discussions,  we ask each LLM agent to participate actively by contributing when they have relevant insights or corrections. \n\nFor moderate complexity case, agents could engage in discussions to clarify or emphasize points in each round / turn. In high complexity case, a lead clinician agent guided the process, asking assistant LLMs for specific investigations and deciding which agents to consult based on their expertise.\n\n**Q5. Are Individual Expert LLMs Variated by Prompts?**\n\nYes, we assigned specific roles to the LLMs with detailed descriptions during the initialization step. These roles were determined by the recruiter LLM, to give LLM a clear function, which allowed for varied interactions based on the prompts. The initialization prompt is detailed in Appendix C.2, where we show the Agent initialization prompt.\n\n**Q6. Why was MedVidQA evaluated with Gemini Pro Vision?**\n\nWe evaluated MedVidQA with Gemini-Pro Vision because it was the only model capable of effectively handling both text and video inputs with reasonable performance. Alternatively, we can sample frames from the videos and transcribe (e.g. whisper) the spoken text to provide images and text to vision LLMs (e.g. gpt-4v), but Gemini-Pro Vision offered a more integrated solution for video input.\n\nWe hope our responses have addressed your concerns. Please do not hesitate to let us know if any further explanations or updates are needed to assist in the re-evaluation of our paper.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Nori et al. (2023).

We are encouraged that they found the work to be important and novel with a comprehensive evaluation and strong results. \n\nBased on the reviews we have made significant updates to our paper and would like to highlight these changes:\n\n**1. Additional experiments with an increased number of samples.**\n\nWe have conducted additional experiments by increasing the sample size from 50 to 100 for all benchmarks. We were initially limited by the computational and economic cost of running a larger sample, we do believe that 100 samples provide a robust performance number. To support this, we have performed an evaluation on the entire test set for the MedQA dataset. The results from these expanded experiments, detailed in the attached pdf file, demonstrate that the performance trends are consistent across all benchmarks. This consistency suggests that our initial selection of 50 samples and the new results with 100 samples are representative of the performance on the whole dataset. \n\nTo reiterate, the decision to use 50 samples initially was based on our intention to align with previous studies, such as [1], which employed an identical sample size in their initial version of the paper. Moreover, our choice was influenced by the constraints of our experimental budget (refer to Table 3 in attached pdf file), particularly the computational costs associated with using the gpt-4-turbo model.\n\nWe also plan to further add experimental results incorporating 100 samples with 3 random seeds in the camera-ready version to ensure meaningful comparisons and enhance the robustness of our findings.\n\n**2. Medical complexity annotations obtained from human physicians**\n\nWe have conducted an annotation study with three physicians to evaluate the complexity of 50 representative questions from the MedQA dataset. The questions were carefully selected to ensure they required equivalent medical expertise across different USMLE steps (1, 2, and 3), providing a comprehensive assessment of complexity.\n\nTwo among the three physicians had two years of medical training Internal Medicine (Post graduate year 2 (PGY-2) and one among them is a general physician. They rated the questions on a scale of -1 (low), 0 (moderate), and 1 (high). To assess inter-rater reliability, we calculated the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), focusing on the most informative types:\n\n* ICC2k (Two-way random effects, average measures): 0.269 [-0.14, 0.55]\n\n* ICC3k (Two-way mixed effects, average measures): 0.280 [-0.15, 0.57]\n\nThese ICC values indicate moderate agreement among the raters, highlighting the inherent complexity and subjectivity in evaluating medical questions. The variability in ratings could be attributed to differences in individual experience, interpretation of the question's context, and the nuances of medical knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, we used several LLMs to annotate the same questions and compared their assessments with the majority opinion of the physicians. To determine the majority opinion among the physicians, we calculated the mode of their ratings. If the ratings were entirely different (e.g., -1, 0, 1), we used the mean value as the final complexity scale, ensuring a balanced representation when no consensus was reached. \n\n* gpt-4o-mini: -0.090 correlation\n\n* gpt-4o: 0.022 correlation\n\n* gpt-4: 0.070 correlation\n\n* gemini-1.5-flash: 0.110 correlation\n\nThe LLMs showed low agreement with human complexity judgments, reflecting the challenges in automating nuanced medical assessments. Differences in physician ratings show subjectivity, suggesting that clear guidelines could improve consistency. We believe enhancing LLMs with better context understanding, medical knowledge, and diverse training datasets may help improve alignment with human physicians.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Nori, H., Lee, Y.

While such qualitative capabilities are vital to medical diagnosis, in real-world scenarios, doctors frequently use clinical calculators that follow quantitative equations and rule-based reasoning paradigms for evidence-based decision support. To this end, we propose MedCalc-Bench, a first-of-its-kind dataset focused on evaluating the medical calculation capability of LLMs. MedCalc-Bench contains an evaluation set of over 1000 manually reviewed instances from 55 different medical calculation tasks. Each instance in MedCalc-Bench consists of a patient note, a question requesting to compute a specific medical value, a ground truth answer, and a step-by-step explanation showing how the answer is obtained. While our evaluation results show the potential of LLMs in this area, none of them are effective enough for clinical settings. Common issues include extracting the incorrect entities, not using the correct equation or rules for a calculation task, or incorrectly performing the arithmetic for the computation. We hope our study highlights the quantitative knowledge and reasoning gaps in LLMs within medical settings, encouraging future improvements of LLMs for various clinical calculation tasks.

To address your concerns: \n\n> Somewhere around line 98/99 I am missing information on the medical professionals assessing the cases: who were they? What was their agreement (e.g. interrater kappa)? Perhaps the Equator Prisma guidelines for systematic reviews might provide helpful guidance https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/good-research-practices-for-comparative-effectiveness-research-defining-reporting-and-interpreting-nonrandomized-studies-of-treatment-effects-using-secondary-data-sources-the-ispor-good-research-pr/).\n\nWe employed senior medical students to verify the extracted attribute values when curating the dataset. We will change “medical professionals” to “annotators with medical background”. Specifically, their directions were to verify that the GPT-4 extracted attribute values for a given calculator were correct based on the patient’s health status. For example, we received assistance with verifying attributes such as whether the patient has renal disease in the note for the computation of the HAS-BLED score. Due to the limited number of annotators and the labor-intensive nature of the annotation task, each instance was only verified by one annotator. We will acknowledge this in the limitation section.\n\n> Limitation section is very brief. Authors could comment a bit on way how to A) further improve the dataset B) actions to improve the computational abilities of LLMs.\n\nThank you for your suggestion. We will expand the “Limitations and Future Work” section to address both of these important questions.\n\nSpecifically, for A), we can improve the dataset by adding more instances and calculators for each instance as there are currently only 1047 patient notes available for the test set, although this is comparable to commonly used biomedical benchmarks such as MedQA (1273 test instances) and PubMedQA (500 test instances). In particular, we hope to expand our dataset by having more calculators related to specific risk calculations and also having a broader range of parameters for equation-based calculators as the majority of equation-based calculators have between 3-5 parameters. \n\nRegarding B), we would like to mention that we have investigated two actions that could improve the computational abilities of LLMs. Firstly, we investigated whether having the LLM write code and automatically compile the code can improve the performance of LLMs in section C of the appendix. Under this code-augmented setting, we observed an improvement of 6.60% (from 23.69% to 30.29%) for GPT-3.5-turbo and an improvement of 10.59% (from 37.92% to 48.51%) for GPT-4. We have also investigated fine-tuning on a training set and presented the improved results for two open-source LLMs in section D of the appendix. We found a 38.40% improvement for Mistral-7B (from 10.79% to 49.19%) and a 44.22% improvement for Llama2-7B (1.53% to 45.75%). For more discussion, we will add in our limitations section that there are additional methods that can improve LLM’s ability to do computation that we should benchmark with for future work. This includes augmenting an LLM with an already implemented function of the calculator (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.13.23299881v1), training an LLM with step-by-step PPO (https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08935) which has improved effects on GSM8k, or implementing test-time inference methods (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314). \n\n> In general, well written paper. In some cases, the sentences are still a bit verbose and could be shortened. Exp.: In my opinion lines 42-60 are duplicative to the text in chapter 2, although I liked the bullet points. I acknowledge by being a physician that medical writing style is different than the style of the engineering sciences. Also paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 are oddly sticking out. Please either drop them entirely, or elaborate more. If you decide to keep them, I don’t see the point in separating them. As such, 5.3 could be integrated into 5.2.\n\nWe appreciate your positive feedback. We will proofread the paper and trim lengthy sentences. We can understand how section 5.3 “sticks out,” as it’s about tool learning whereas the other two sections are about datasets, specifically in medicine and mathematics. To fix this, we will adjust 5.3 to mention datasets similar to MedCalc-Bench. These datasets have been studied by researchers who investigated tool-learning solutions for LLMs to solve computation problems in the clinical setting. \n\n> It is a good paper, focusing on a very interesting and most likely widely used application of LLMs in the future. Good figures and tables in the paper enhance the readability. Room for improvement: Table 1 – please add legend for L., I suppose it should read length? Table 2 – is very busy with two decimals which suggest a non-existing level of accuracy, consider rounding to 1 decimal or even integers. Table 4 – even busier, consider rounding to 1 decimal. Please add explanation to error types as a legend for quick cross referencing.\n\nThank you for your comments. Yes, you are correct, “L” stands for “length” in Table 1 and we will modify that column name. We will also round all reported values in Table 2 and Table 4 to one decimal point to make the tables more readable. Additionally, in the caption for Table 4, we will specify what each error type indicates by their exact name (Type A - Knowledge Errors, Type B - Extraction Errors, Type C - Computation Errors).\n\nWe hope our response addresses your concerns and are pleased to answer any follow-up questions you may have.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for their feedback and appreciate that they found the paper easy to read. To address your concerns: \n\n> 1. It is not clear how the evaluation of error type is realized by GPT4. And how human evaluation for such automation is implemented?\n\nThe evaluation of error type by GPT-4 is done in two steps. Firstly, for the questions that the LLM incorrectly answers, we prompt GPT-4 to explain the mistakes in the LLM-generated explanation and then identify the error type (Type A - Knowledge Errors, Type B - Extraction Errors, Type C - Computation Errors, Type D - Other). This is done by giving the patient note, the calculation question, the LLM-generated explanation, the ground-truth explanation, and the error type definitions. We then randomly sampled 200 examples and manually checked whether GPT-4 had correctly identified the error type with the correct explanation for why the LLM-response is incorrect. We found an 89% agreement on this subset, which suggests that the GPT-4 error classifier is of high accuracy. As such, we used GPT-4 to classify the errors for all MedCalc-Bench questions  that an LLM gets incorrect and reported the numbers in Table 4.\n\n> 2. Error type sample shown in Figure 3. Are the color marked incorrect rationale and comments annotated by human or GPT4? If it is by GPT4, how is it realized?\n\nWe assume that this comment relates to Table 3 as there is only one figure in the first 9 pages of our paper.

I understand this is a pioneering work filling the gap, so I encourage the authors to keep maintaining and improving the datasets with more instances and calculators. \n\nWe agree with you and have acknowledged that our test dataset is relatively small in the Limitations (Line 223-225), although this is comparable to commonly used biomedical benchmarks such as MedQA (1273 test instances) and PubMedQA (500 test instances). In addition to the high cost of domain-specific annotations, many calculators do not have enough eligible patients that are publicly available for instance curation. For example, while some calculators such as Adjusted Body Weight have several hundred patient notes available, this is not the case for less common calculators such as FENa and MeldNa Score. Hence,  we include up to 20 instances for a given calculator to create a balanced dataset that can fairly evaluate the clinical computation abilities of LLMs.\n\nWe will keep maintaining the dataset. We also agree that adding more calculators will make it more comprehensive. Currently, MedCalc-Bench contains 55 calculators that are listed as “Popular” calculators on MDCalc. These calculators already cover a diverse computational and reasoning skill set (listed in Table 1). While calculators outside of this category could be useful as well, we did not find a systematic and unbiased way to select which ones to include in our study. For future work, we will add more calculators based on the interest of clinicians and the frequency of usage in the practice.\n\n> Consider evaluating few-shot learning beyond one-shot examples in future work.\n\nThank you for your comment. Having more examples may improve LLMs' ability on MedCalc-Bench. Currently, the main challenge is that some calculators do not have enough notes for this to be possible. Additionally, the context of these notes can be thousands of tokens long and may not fit into the context length of some LLMs. We have acknowledged this limitation in our paper (Line 229-230). We will leave it as future work after more instances are curated for each calculator and longer-context LLMs are adopted in our evaluations.\n\n> For reproducibility, I would suggest the authors conduct experiments with the GPT APIs and set the temperature to 0.0. \n\nWe agree with the importance of reproducibility, and all of our experiments were conducted with a temperature of 0 using the Azure OpenAI API.

Firstly we would like to emphasize that, one of the main claims of our paper is when solving optimization problems like equation (1), the cost of computing expensive derivative operators can be amortized over the stochastic optimization of the neural network ansatz. This is why we conduct all the experiments under a stochastic optimization. We regret that this point was not communicated more clearly, and we will try to make this point more prominent in the final version of the paper.\n\nIt is possible to conduct yet another experiment that directly compares the accuracy of differential operators under different randomization batch sizes, and we do expect to see that variance decreases proportional to the randomization batch size. However, this does not determine the effectiveness of STDE as explained above, and we think it would be more interesting to show the effect of randomization batch size on the convergence of various PDEs.\n\n> Additionally, do you have any intuition why batchsize=16&64 get stuck whilst both a smaller and a larger batchsize do not?\n\nThis was puzzling for us as well.

Compared with original ...\n\nThanks for your insightful comment. We want to first clarify that, the main takeaway we wish to show out of this comparison between FL and STDE is to highlight the fact that randomization is important for scalability in dimensionality. While FL removes the redundancy in normal AD, being an exact method its complexity still grows with the dimensionality of the domain. We are not claiming that STDE beats FL, but rather to emphasize that randomization is key and there is potentially a lot of research to be done at the intersection of randomized linear algebra and automatic differentiation. In fact, from Table 2 one can see that in the low-dimensional regime, FL is clearly the best method both in terms of speed and memory.\n\nIt is certainly true that a randomized FL will perform much better in terms of scalability, but this entails non-trivial work. In general, for each specific differential operator, there could exist optimized forward rules like FL, as also pointed out by reviewer xY8N. We believe that developing a comprehensive set of such rules is a promising direction, but we think it is out of the scope of this paper.\n\nRegarding the accuracy reduction due to randomization, we would suggest the reviewer inspect the relative error data shown in Table 3. From the table, one can see that L2 error under randomization has the same order as exact methods like FL. However, to ascertain the stochastic error for solving a specific problem like the many-electron Schrödinger equations requires further investigation.\n\nFor the cost-accuracy curve you've mentioned, we have added additional experiments where the results are included in the rebuttal PDF. Please refer to the global rebuttal and the PDF attached.\n\n> 2. All the test ...\n\n- Besides the Laplacians and the Biharmonic operator, we also provide an example of amortized g-PINN in Appendix I.4.2 which is both high-dimensional and high-order. Furthermore, we have provided a general procedure for constructing sparse STDE for arbitrary derivative operators in Appendix F.\n- The high-order diagonal differential operator is a straightforward extension of the Laplacian operator.\n- We believe that the comparison between randomized AD and direct back-propagation is redundant as it is already done in previous work ([13]).\n- This work applies to any problem where one needs to compute a differentiable operator on the input of an NN, as explained in the introduction. STDE applies naturally to PINN but it can also be applied to other problems that require input gradients. For example, adversarial attacks, feature attribution, and meta-learning, to name a few. The method is not suited for computing the derivative of NN parameter as explained in Section 3.\n\n> 3. Some of the highly related existing works are missing...\n\nThank you for pointing out these relevant works that we are not aware of.\n- In [1], an exact AD method is proposed for computing arbitrary **second-order** differential operators. The idea is similar to our idea in equations (19) and (22) where matrix decomposition and change of basis are employed, but the overall algorithm is different. It is worth stressing again that our method applies to **arbitrary derivative order**. We will cite this paper in our final version since it is highly relevant.\n- Regarding section 3.4, this is just background material as it falls under the preliminaries section. We provided a detailed write-up here because it serves as an important context for our main contribution in section 4.1, and we want to set up the notation in a way that facilitates the explanation of our idea. It is true that [2] also discussed the geometric interpretation of Taylor-mode AD, but this is also discussed in earlier literature we cited in Section 2. Nevertheless, we will include [2] in related works in the final version for completeness' sake.\n\n> 4. As is discussed in Section 4.4...\n\nSection 4.4 section refers to the **dense** version of STDE which has limited applicability. The **sparse** STDE is universally applicable. Reviewer yjY8 also asked a question about the comparison between the two, please refer to my answer to that question for further clarification.\n\n> 5. The author didn’t ...\n\nThanks for bringing up this important question. How large $l$ should be depends on how off-diagonal the operator is. If the operator is diagonal as in the case of equation (17), $l=k$ is enough. If the operator is maximally non-diagonal, i.e. it is a partial derivative where all dimensions to be differentiated are distinct, then the minimum $l$ needed is $(1+k)k/2$. For more details, please refer to Section F where a general procedure for determining the jet structure is discussed.\n\n> 6. Some parts of the writing are confusing...\n\nThanks for your detailed checking on the correctness of the terminology.\n- When we say equation (18) is 'general' we mean that it includes a large class of commonly used second-order PDEs. We also mention that they are parabolic in the paragraph.\n- When we say 'inseparable and effectively high-dimensional', we are stressing the fact that the solution does not have strong symmetries such that the effective dimension can be drastically reduced via some change of variables. For example, if the solution has spherical symmetry, then the equation becomes a 1D under spherical coordinates.\n- For the equations in Appendix I.2, you are right that they are semilinear parabolic equations. However, they are also specifically driftless Fokker-Planck equations with semilinear extension, and Fokker-Planck equations are a subset of parabolic equations. Similarly, semilinear equations are nonlinear, but there are other types of nonlinearity like quasilinear. So I guess both terminologies are okay, and this is really just a personal preference.\n\n**Questions**\n\nThanks for these insightful questions.

We ran all three equations from the Inseparable and effectively high-dimensional PDEs (Appendix I.1) with moderately high dimensions (100k), with different randomization batch sizes (1, 4, 16, 64, 100, 256). And we compared their final L2 error and convergence time. As expected, with a smaller batch size the iterations per second are higher (third row of the figure). Memory cost remains roughly the same since the computation graph was not changed. Rather surprisingly, the final L2 error and the time for convergence did not exhibit a linear relationship to randomization batch size, as can be seen in the first row and last row of the figure. Specifically, one can see that the batch size of 1 provides good L2 error and convergence time, regardless of the equation chosen. One explanation is that stochastic optimizers like Adam already have built-in mechanisms to control the variance and are robust to noise during training, so smaller batch sizes can perform well. This warrants further investigation that is out of the scope of this paper.\n\n**Questions from reviewer cUDy**\n\nReviewer cUDy asked a lot of insightful questions. We answer them here as it would benefit all reviewers to better understand our papers.\n\n> 1. Which function does 'univariate' refer to ...\n\nFirstly we would like to clarify that, our contribution is the insight that the scalar version of Faà di Bruno's formula can be used to perform derivative tensor contractions for multivariate functions, and the vector-valued version of Faà di Bruno's formula is not needed, as discussed in section 4.1. Although the vector-valued Faà di Bruno's formula is introduced in Appendix D.2 (equation 41), it is **not** used in our method. We only use the univariate version (equation 42). In fact, one of our main insights was that for multivariate functions, the scalar version of Faà di Bruno's formula can be used to perform derivative tensor contractions,\n\nAs for your other question, in section 4.1, the multivariate function that we perform tensor contraction on is $F$. In section 3.4, the univariate function we are referring to is $F\\circ g$, where the high-order chain rule is given by the scalar version of Faà di Bruno's formula.\n\n> 2. In Appendix D ...\n\nIn Appendix D we discussed both the scalar and the vector version of Faà di Bruno's formula. The scalar version corresponds to the case of $n=1$ and the vector version corresponds to the case of $n>1$. In this work, we only consider $n=1$, which is enough for our method as discussed in section 4.1.\n\n> 3. Although the authors claim...\n\nTypically we would assume that the coefficient tensor has a certain structure. For example, in the case of equation 77, the operator $\\frac{\\partial^{3}}{\\partial x_{j} \\partial x_{i}^{2}}u$ is the diagonal of every rank-2 slice over the first axis of $D^3_u$. So one could sample the index $jii$ by sampling $j$ and $i$ separately from $[1,N]$. Even in the most general case where the index set to be sampled has no apparent structure, sampling the index set is still cheaper than computing the whole derivative tensor.\n\n> 4. Could the authors ...\n\nOne example would be the many-body Schrödinger equations, where we need to compute a high-dimensional Laplacian. Another example is the high-dimensional Black-Scholes equation, which has numerous uses in mathematical finance.\n\n> 5. Does STDE ..\n\nIn FL and [1], sparsity of intermediate derivative tensor are exploited to save memory and compute. The same idea can be applied to STDE, but it would require some modification to the JAX Taylor mode library. We have not yet done this, but it is an interesting future direction to work on.\n\n> 6. Instead of tackling ...\n\nIn general, STDE provides a way to compute high-order derivative tensor elements with one forward pass. For high-order and low-dimensional operators, if the derivative tensor is sparse, then acceleration is possible, as shown by the experiments in section I.4.1.\n\nIn the case of Monge-Ampère equation, there is no sparsity since the operator $\\det(\\text{Hess} u)$ contains all entries from the second-order derivative tensor (Hessian matrix). One still might perform sampling among the additive terms in the determinant, which could provide acceleration when the dimension is high.\n\nIn the case of Ricci curvature, the operator is highly nonlinear since it involves computing the inverse of the metric tensor. In this case, STDE cannot be applied straightforwardly since obtaining an unbiased estimator usually requires linearity.\n\n> On writing and notations:\n\n> 1. Can you clarify ...\n\n$d^2u_\\theta$ does not denote the Hessian, but rather the second-order pushforward as described in section 3.4, equation 7. The input $(a,e_j,0)$ is a 2-jet, where $a$ is the primal, and $e_j$ and $0$ are the tangents.\n\nThe need for indexing notation like $[2]$ comes from the fact that the output is also a jet, which is a tuple that contains the primal and the tangents. We use the indexing notation to select a specific output tangent from the output jet.\n\n> 2. In Eqn.(19), it should be $\\sum_{i=1}^d$.\n\nYes, you are right, thanks for pointing out the typo.\n\n> 3. In L247, do you mean $v\\sim p$,, instead of $(a,v,0)\\sim p$?\n\nI think these two are synonymous, as $a$ here is not a R.V.\n\n> 4. In the ‘100D’ column of table 2, 539 is not the smallest number. Why is it in bold?\n\nThanks for pointing out this typo, the smallest memory usage should be 507MB achieved by FL.\n\n> 5. There needs to ...\n\nIn the Appendix, Einstein notation was first used and mentioned in equation 41.\n\nAs for equation 45, we are using the scalar version of Faà di Bruno's formula, so there are no $n,\\ n’,\\ n’’$ indices.\n\n$\\partial^4$ refers to the fourth-order Fréchet derivative, whose definition is given in equation 35.

In 291 it is stated ""Since the only change is how the derivatives are computed, the relative L2 error is expected to be of the same order among different methods"". Is this accurate? SDGD and STDE are stochastic approximations whereas Forward Laplace is not.\n\nThanks for pointing out this issue. Yes, you are right, Forward Laplacian is an exact method, so it is expected to perform better in terms of L2 error. However, as we can see in Table 4, the L2 error is of the same order, at least in the case where the dimension is >1k. We will update the description of this section in the final version to reflect this point.\n\n> 2. I am a bit unclear about how to choose a distribution over the l-jets that satisfy the unbiasedness condition for any specific problem. It seems that the sparse random jets have the advantage of universally applicable but they also seem to involve a lot of redundant computations.\n\nRegarding computation cost, it is worth pointing out that both the sparse and the dense versions of STDE would have similar computation costs if the batch size of random jets were the same. The main differences between the sparse and the dense version of STDE are (1) sparse STDE is universally application whereas the dense STDE can only be applied to certain operators, as you\'ve pointed out; (2) the source of variance is different (see Appendix K.3). In general, we would suggest to use sparse STDE unless we know a priori that the sparse version would suffer from excess variance and the dense STDE is applicable.\n\nFor constructing STDE for a specific problem, you could refer to the various examples provided in the paper, or follow the method outlined in Appendix F for sparse jet, or Appendix K.1 for dense jet.'}}, 'id': 'tvtXOtnjcW', 'forum': 'J2wI2rCG2u', 'replyto': 'MgSkBWw25n', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14856/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14856/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14856/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722839833207, 'cdate': 1722839833207, 'tmdate': 1730883318828, 'mdate': 1730883318828, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""**Weaknesses**\n> While the paper demonstrates the significant strengths and broad applicability of STDE, it is important to acknowledge some limitations and areas for future improvement.

In precision-demanding tasks, e.g. solving many-electron Schrödinger equations, the inaccurate value of differential operators will possibly result in an unreliable solution. To make the result more convincing, a cost-accuracy curve (STDE with different number of random samplings, i.e. $|J|$ in Eqn.(17)) should be added.  \nFurthermore, in light of this, the comparison between STDE and FL in super high dimensions (in table 1,2) is unfair. A possible remedy is to compare STDE with modified FL, which employs randomness to be more scalable, for instance, Monte Carlo over dimensions. The author can refer to [1] for more technical and implementation details of FL.\n2.\tAll the test cases of high-dimensional high-order operators are Laplacians (including $\\Delta^2$). The high-order diagonal differential operator is mentioned in L216 but does not appear in the experiments. A comparison between STDE and direct back-propagation is expected.  \nThe applications are all coming from the small area of PINN. To demonstrate the broad impact of this work, the author should target more tasks of general interest, e.g. second order derivative of NN parameter, which plays an important role in accelerating optimizations. \n3.\tSome of the highly related existing works are missing. E.g.,\n-\tRegarding L63, the forward rule for general different operators is done in [1].\n-\tRegarding the geometric interpretation of Taylor-mode AD in sec 3.4, although not explicitly mentioned in Ref. [6] in the paper, is discussed in section 2 of [2]. The author should cite [6] or the first paper presenting similar ideas, and clarify their novelty if they still hope to claim generalizing univariate Taylor mode AD as their contribution.\n4.\tAs is discussed in Section 4.4, STDE can not be applied to *arbitrary* high-order operators. Obviously, this restricts the potential application scenarios of STDE.\n5.\tThe author didn’t discuss how large $l$ would be for large $k$ (notations from L165), which is necessary to assess the effectiveness of STDE for general high-order derivatives.\n6.\tSome parts of the writing are confusing. See **Questions**.\nAlso, there are several misuses of terminologies. E.g.,\n-\tFréchet derivative, not Frechet.\n-\tThe form of second order PDE in Eq.(18) is not ‘general’.

Please refer to Eq.(10) or Eq.(1) in [1] for *general* second-order operator.\n-\tIn Appendix I.1 and the main text, ‘inseparable and effectively high-dimensional’, I guess what the authors intend to say is ‘elliptic’.

What is the first contribution (in the introduction), generalizing Taylor mode AD to the case where $g$ is multivariate, or $F$? I am skeptical of the authors’ claiming it as a contribution/novelty because it seems like this is merely about replacing scalar Faà di Bruno's formula with that of tensors.\n2.\tIn Appendix D, where $g$ defines an $n$-dimensional manifold, is $n$ always set to 1 in this work? If not, please point me to where the method with general $n$ is discussed.\n3.\tAlthough the authors claim to remove the exponential complexity w.r.t. the order of derivatives, for general operators the size of coefficient tensor **${C}$** in Eqn(10) grows exponentially and the sampling procedure in Eqn(15) will become hard.\n4.\tCould the authors think of any real application scenarios with high-order high-dim operators? As for the case of low-dim high-order operators, the authors need to check if the differential operator takes up a considerable proportion of the whole process, e.g. training PINN. If not, the benefit of accelerating differential operators might be very limited.\n5.\tDoes STDE have the potential to make use of sparsity in the neural network function, as shown in FL and [1]? For the specific case of second-order operators, how would STDE perform when $C$ is dense but low-rank?\n6.\tInstead of tackling a scalar function (e.g. Laplacian of a function), could STDE help with the computation of tensor-value functions, e.g. Hessian or curvature? Hessian appears in Monge-Ampère equation and Ricci curvature appears in Einstein equation.  \n\nOn writing and notations:  \n1. Can you clarify on ‘$[2]$’ in L214 with more details or concrete examples? For me, $d^2u_\\theta$ in Eqn.(16) is a (0,2)-tensor (Hessian), but why does it take three input $(a,e_j,0)$? Please also clarify on ‘$[3]$’ in Eqn(44). \n2.\tIn Eqn.(19), it should be $\\sum_{i=1}^d$.\n3.\tIn L247, do you mean $v\\sim p$,, instead of $(a,v,0)\\sim p$?\n4.\tIn the ‘100D’ column of table 2, 539 is not the smallest number. Why is it in bold?\n5.\tThere needs to be more description in section F.1.  \nIt is good to remind the readers that Einstein notation is employed in Eq.(45) and that the indices $n,\\ n’,\\ n’’$ are omitted.\nThe author should inform the readers that in the discussion $n=1$ for $n$ in Eq(40) and notations like $\\partial^4u(x)(e_i,e_j,0,0)$ refers to setting $v^{(1)}=e_i,\\ v^{(2)}=e_j$ instead of the taking $e_i,e_j,0,0$ as inputs for a (0-4) tensor.   \n\nOverall, this paper has the potential to be a good work.

When adapting the output interface, label mapping methods transform the pretrained labels to downstream labels by establishing a gradient-free one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of labels.However, in this paper, we reveal that one-to-one mappings may overlook the complex relationship between pretrained and downstream labels. Motivated by this observation, we propose a B ayesian-guided L abel M apping (BLM) method. BLM constructs an iteratively-updated probabilistic label mapping matrix, with each element quantifying a pairwise relationship between pretrained and downstream labels.The assignment of values to the constructed matrix is guided by Bayesian conditional probability, considering the joint distribution of the downstream labels and the labels predicted by the pretrained model on downstream samples. Experiments conducted on both pretrained vision models (e.g., ResNeXt) and vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) demonstrate the superior performance of BLM over existing label mapping methods. The success of BLM also offers a probabilistic lens through which to understand and analyze the effectiveness of VR.Our code is available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/BayesianLM.","Oral Session 6B: Safety, New Data",https://openreview.net/pdf?id=135eKqDoRR,https://openreview.net/forum?id=135eKqDoRR,135eKqDoRR,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'This paper presents work on visual reprogramming -- leveraging existing vision models and adapting them to solve tasks involving different labels.

This paper falls in the scope of Visual Reprogramming (VR). Thus, the experimental setting of this paper aligns with those used in previous VR studies, particularly ILM [1], to ensure comparability and consistency in the field. This setting serves as an established benchmark for evaluating VR techniques.\n\nRegarding when fine-tuning the last layer is not feasible, we consider the following cases:\n1. copyright and legal constraints: modifying some pretrained models may violate licensing agreements or intellectual property rights.\n2. prevent catastrophic forgetting: keeping the pretrained model intact helps to maintain its general knowledge across tasks\n3. black-box optimization: in addition, our method is useful when only the predicted logits of input are available. It does not need access to the model's internal parameters which fine-tuning clearly struggles to handle.\n\n**W2:** Thank you for your question. Due to space limitations, lines 253-266 of the original text are not fully described. We will move this section to the appendix in the next version and include detailed information.\n\n**W3:** We appreciate your feedback regarding the presentation of Sec. 4 and algorithm tables. We acknowledge your point about the placement of the algorithm tables. Due to space constraints, we had initially placed them in the Appendix (lines 455 and 462). However, we recognize the importance of making these algorithms more readily accessible to readers. We plan to move the main algorithm table to Sec. 4 as you suggested in the final version.\n\nWe understand your concern regarding the equations in Sec. 4. While the mathematical formulations are important for a rigorous presentation, we will smooth out the section with more practical insights. We aim to strike a balance between mathematical precision and practical applicability.\n\n**W4:** Thank you for your question. The use of Padding or Watermarking depends on the specific downstream tasks, and we believe the selection may partly depend on the relationship between the pretrained model's input size and the downstream task's image dimensions.\nFor instance, let’s consider the results of BLM+ using ResNet-18 as the pre-trained model:\n\n| | GTSRB | SVHN | CIFAR10 | CIFAR100 | Flowers102 | EuroSAT | OxfordPets | SUN397 | UCF101 | Food101 | DTD |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| Image Size | 32 | 32 | 32 | 32 | 128 | 128 | 128 | 128 | 128 | 128 | 128 |\n| Padding | 54.3 | 74.2 | 66.8 | 30.6 | 50.1 | 86.7 | 70.6 | 18.7 | 32.0 | 25.1 | 43.9 |\n| Watermarking | 82.0 | 78.8 | 75.7 | 41.6 | 44.1 | 84.8 | 73.3 | 19.4 | 35.4 | 22.9 | 43.0 |\n\nOur observations:\n- watermarking performs better when there is a significant size disparity: for tasks with much smaller images (32x32, e.g., GTSRB, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100) compared to the pre-trained model's input (224x224), watermarking often outperforms padding. It prevents introducing too many parameters around the image and significantly downscaling it.\n- padding may perform better with larger downstream images in some cases: for tasks using larger images (128x128, e.g., Flowers102, EuroSAT), padding tends to perform better. It maintains the original image integrity by avoiding pixel value alterations.\n\nIn general, the choice impacts how we adapt pretrained model to new tasks. Therefore, the goal for input VR is to maximize the transfer of learned features while accommodating the new task's visual characteristics - the optimal choice may depend on factors beyond just image size and deserves future explorations.\n\n**W5:** Thank you! Indeed, the accuracy typically improves with larger training sets. Our focus on smaller $n$ values serves as a purpose in evaluating the robustness of our proposed methods, BLM/BLM+, compared to the baseline ILM under limited data availability conditions. Our rationale for this evaluation is:\n1. Practical implications: VR was proposed for adapting pretrained model to data-limited tasks. In this sense, obtaining large-scale labeled downstream task data can be challenging. By demonstrating robust performance with smaller $n$ (25%, 50%, and 75% of the original size), we highlight the practical advantages of BLM/BLM+ in data-limited scenarios, which better aligns with real-world applications.\n2. Overfitting risk: Smaller training sets inherently carry a higher risk of overfitting. By testing our methods under these conditions, we can better assess their generalization capabilities compared to the baseline ILM.\nThus, these experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness and reliability of BLM/BLM+ across various data regimes. While increasing $n$ may not be that meaningful, our evaluation aims to demonstrate that BLM/BLM+ maintains competitive performance even with limited data, thus providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the practical utility.\n\n[1] Chen et al.

The gap between left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) comes from the relationship between Maximum Likelihood Estimation (LHS) and Empirical Risk Minimization (RHS) in statistical learning theory.\n- LHS: represents the true objective of VR is to maximize the conditional probability of downstream label given downstream input image.\n- RHS: provides a practical and empirical approximation using a finite training set and a chosen loss function.\n\nThis formulation aligns with fundamental principles in learning theory: \n- We use empirical risk as a proxy for the expected risk.\n- A loss function is chosen to approximate the negative log-likelihood.\n- This approximation connects to generalization bounds. The gap between the expected and empirical risks can be bounded using techniques like VC-dimension.\n- The law of large numbers ensures convergence of empirical to expected risk as the training set size increases.\n\nHowever, we agree that using RHS directly is more straightforward. We plan to incorporate your suggestion in the next version for easier understanding.\n\n**W2:** Thanks for the suggestion, we will include () in the next version.\n\n**W3:** Thank you for your question. In fact, step 3 (applying $\\omega$) is performed after step 2 (calculating $\\omega$, and the blue dotted line indicates the flow of $\\omega$). However, after calculating $\\omega$, the logits output from step 1 will also be used to obtain the final prediction result in step 3 (as shown by the purple solid line). We will revise Fig. 2 to more clearly illustrate this process in the next version of the paper.\n\n**W4:** Thanks for pointing it out. The omission of $x$ in Eq. 10 was intentional because:\n- Our analysis in Sec 4.2 (and Appendix Sec. C) focuses on output label mapping (LM) and specifically compares different LM methods, provided that the pretrained model $f_{\\rm pre}$, input $x$, and input transformations $f_{\\rm in}$ are the same across different LM methods (details in Appendix Sec. C.1).\n- The expected accuracy calculation is based on conditional probabilities where $x$ is implicitly part of the condition. As all LM methods operate on the same $x$, we can safely omit it, allowing us to concisely highlight the differences of LM themselves.\n\nWe will also add a note in the main text to clarify this omission, emphasizing our focus on comparing LM methods and the scope of this analysis.\n\n**W5:** Thank you for your question. We will clarify it in the next version. $y_r^{\\rm S}$ means a class that is more relevant to $y_{i}^{\\rm T}$ (line 256), while $y_{\\bar r}^{\\rm S}$ is a class that is less relevant to $y_{i}^{\\rm T}$ (line 257).

In the next version, we will expand our literature review to include relevant transfer learning concepts, particularly focusing on how Visual Reprogramming relates to and differs from traditional transfer learning methods. To better position this paper, we'll also discuss the spectrum of transfer learning techniques, connect and compare Visual Reprogramming with other parameter fine-tuning methods, highlighting its merits in scenarios where pretrained model preservation is crucial.\n\n**W2/Q2/W3/Q3:** Thanks for the question. To make our reply relevant, we will discuss the transferability in the context of VR.\n\n**Transferability in VR** Drawing on theoretical foundations from [1], the transferability of a pretrained model to a downstream task can be bounded by:\n$$\\mathcal{L}^{\\rm{T}} \\leq \\mathcal{L}^{\\rm{S}} + \\mathcal{W}(\\mu^\\rm{S}, \\mu^\\rm{T}) + \\epsilon$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}^{\\rm{T}}$ and $\\mathcal{L}^{\\rm{S}}$ denotes error for downstream and pretrained tasks. $\\mathcal{W}(\\mu^\\rm{S}, \\mu^\\rm{T})$ is the Wasserstein distance between the logit distributions of pretrained input $\\mu^\\rm{S} = f_{\\rm pre} (x^{\\rm S})$ and the reprogrammed downstream input $\\mu^\\rm{T} = (f_{\\rm pre} \\circ f_{\\text{in}}) (x^{\\rm T})$, $\\epsilon$ is a small constant. We therefore know that the performance on downstream tasks can be related to the pretrained task performance and the alignment between pretrained task and downstream task.\n\n**Model selection** This bound suggests some insights on selecting models:\n- Pretrained model with higher capacity may lead to lower $\\mathcal{L}^{\\rm{S}}$,\n- Pretrained feature is relevant to the downstream task; or input VR and the output LM that effectively transform downstream input and output (both potentially contribute to lower $\\mathcal{W}(\\mu^\\rm{S}, \\mu^\\rm{T})$ distance, indicating better alignment)\n\nFor example, a model with large capacity pretrained on general object recognition (e.g., ResNet on ImageNet) may transfer better to another recognition task than a model pretrained on a highly specialized dataset.\n\n**Transferring between dissimilar domains (e.g., car-animal)** The feasibility depends on how is the Wasserstein distance minimized - this is theoretically possible even for seemingly unrelated domains, but the practical difficulty varies because of the challenge of measuring domain similarity and feature relevance.\n\n**When to use a pretrained model** Currently, there lacks theoretical tools to accurately measure the above Wasserstein distance BEFORE training, which makes it difficult to directly tell when and whether a pretrained model can be used. Therefore, we look forward to future work that focuses on effective ad-hoc estimation of such distance and techniques that minimize it through optimized VR and LM methods.\n\nIn short, while VR offers a flexible way of transfer learning, the choice of pretrained model and its adaptability to a specific downstream task depends on both model capacity and the ability to align the feature distributions.\n\n**W4/Q4:** Thank you for your questions. For details on training time, please refer to **Common Question 1**. Regarding the fine-tuning results, since we follow the settings outlined in [2], we will directly quote these results from [2] in the next version of our paper.\n \n**W5:** Thank you for your suggestion.

We have added a detailed explanation in **Common Question 2** and provided a simple example to illustrate the conditional probabilities. \n\n**W2:**  Thanks. We want to clarify how our analysis can be extended to multi-class cases.\n\n**Expected Accuracy Definition** The formula (Eq. 10) evaluates the expected probability of correctly mapping each $y^{\\rm S} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm S}$ to the corresponding $y^{\\rm T} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm T}$, remaining valid even for multi-class settings. It is agnostic to the number of classes in both $\\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm S}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm T}$.\n\n**Mapping Function Revision** Recall the definition of PLM (Definition C.1) and DLM (Definition C.2) are\n- PLM: $\\mathrm{Acc}(f_{\\rm plm}) = \\sum_{y^{\\rm T} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm T}} p(y^{\\rm T}) \\cdot \\sum_{y^{\\rm S} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm S}} p(y^{\\rm S}) \\cdot \\omega_{y^{\\rm S}, y^{\\rm T}}$\n- DLM: $\\mathrm{Acc}(f_{\\rm dlm}) = \\sum_{y^{\\rm T} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm T}} p(y^{\\rm T}) \\cdot \\sum_{y^{\\rm S} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm S}} p(y^{\\rm S}) \\cdot \\delta_{y^{\\rm S}, g(y^{\\rm S})}$\n\nFor multi-class cases, we need to revise the mapping function from $f_{\\rm lm}(y^{\\rm S}) \\in \\lbrace y^{\\rm T}, 1 - y^{\\rm T} \\rbrace$ in binary label spaces to align with $\\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm S} = \\lbrace1, 2, ..., k_{\\rm S} \\rbrace$, $\\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm T} = \\lbrace1, 2, ..., k_{\\rm T} \\rbrace$. Thus, we need to expand previously used identity/flip mapping rule $g(y^{\\rm S})$ to cover a broader range of possible mappings.\n\n**Proof Sketch** PLM can achieve at least the accuracy of the optimal DLM by constructing $\\omega_{y^{\\rm S}, y^{\\rm T}}$ to match the optimal deterministic mapping rule $g^*(y^{\\rm S})$, which ensures $\\sum_{y^{\\rm S} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm S}} p(y^{\\rm S}) \\cdot \\omega_{y^{\\rm S}, y^{\\rm T}} \\geq \\sum_{y^{\\rm S} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm S}} p(y^{\\rm S}) \\cdot \\mathbb{I}[g^*(y^{\\rm S}) = y^{\\rm T}], \\forall y^{\\rm T} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm T}$. Intuitively, this inequality holds, especially when $g^*(y^{\\rm S}) \\neq y^{\\rm T}$, $\\mathbb{I}[g^*(y^{\\rm S}) = y^{\\rm T}]=0$, while $\\omega_{y^{\\rm S}, y^{\\rm T}}$ can be greater than 0 in such cases, showing better flexibility.\n\nDue to the character limit, we leave the complete proof to future work. We hope this clarification addresses your concern.\n\n**W3:** Thank you. In Appendix Sec. E, we have acknowledged that optimal values may vary across datasets (Fig. 8-9). Our initial use of universal hyperparameters was intended to show that BLM/BLM+'s performance gains are not sensitive to hyperparameters.\n\nFollowing your advice, we quickly run additional experiments using a 70\\%/30\\% train/validation split of the original training set to find optimal hyperparameters for each dataset, shown as\n\n| | Flowers102 | UCF101 | DTD | OxfordPets | CIFAR10 |\n|------------|------------|--------|-------|------------|---------|\n| Optimal $\\alpha$ | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n| Optimal $\\lambda$ | 1 | 1 | 1 | 10 | 10 |\n| Accuracy (Trained on 70% Samples) | 45.82 | 31.84 | **43.75** | **72.27** | **66.54** |\n| Shared $\\alpha$ | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.15 |\n| Shared $\\lambda$ | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| Accuracy (Trained on 70% Samples) | 45.82 | 31.84 | 42.31 | 70.52 | 66.04 |\n\nObserve that dataset-specific tuning indeed yields better performance compared to shared hyperparameters, suggesting that optimal hyperparameters tailored to each dataset are desired. We plan to include these in the revision. \n\n**W4:** Thanks for your question. This observation stems from the statistical nature of our BLM+ algorithm, which computes label mappings based on the co-occurrence of predicted pretrained labels and ground truth downstream labels throughout the VR learning iterations (Fig. 4 visualizes the top-3 predicted pretrained label at each iteration).\n\nIn the later stages of VR learning, we observe that for marigold images $X^\\mathrm{T}$, the conditional probabilities shifted:\n$p(Y^{\\rm T}={\\tt Marigold}|Y^{\\rm S}={\\tt Pineapple}, X^{\\rm T})>p(Y^{\\rm T}={\\tt Marigold}|Y^{\\rm S}={\\tt Teddy}, X^{\\rm T})$\n\n$p(Y^{\\rm T}={\\tt Marigold}|Y^{\\rm S}={\\tt Pineapple}, X^{\\rm T})>p(Y^{\\rm T}={\\tt Marigold}|Y^{\\rm S}={\\tt Broccoli}, X^{\\rm T})$\n\nThis indicates that the feature of marigold images, after processing by input VR and the pretrained model, share more similarities with pineapple than with teddy bears or broccoli. Thus, pineapple replaced these other labels among the top-k predicted pretrained labels.\n\nVisually, this replacement is intuitive as well: The colors of a pineapple — primarily yellow, orange, and gold — are similar to those of Marigold. Teddy bear and Airedale are predominantly brown, while guacamole and broccoli are mainly green. Additionally, the shape of a pineapple, which is typically oval, resembles that of Marigold.\n\n**W5:** Thank you for your suggestion. While space limitations led us to initially place the algorithm tables in the appendix (lines 455 and 462), we recognize the importance of making this information more accessible. In the revision, we will prioritize incorporating them into the main text. We will also work on enriching and smoothing out the method presentation to make it more engaging.\n  \n**W6:** Yes, BLM+ without Top-K and Bayes is the same as BLM without Bayes. Thanks for the reminder, we will explain it clearly.\n\n**W7:** Thank you for your questions. As we follow the settings in [1], the fine-tuning results can be directly quoted from [1], and we will include this in the next version of our paper. Regarding training time, please refer to **Common Question 1** for a detailed answer. Regarding the standard to determine when VR is needed, we believe that (1) when issues such as copyright or avoiding catastrophic forgetting exist, the pre-trained model needs to be kept unchanged; (2) when the resources for training downstream tasks are limited, VR can be used.\n\n[1] Chen et al.

However, during the rebuttal stage, we conducted additional experiments to assess the impact of different epoch numbers (60, 100, 150) on our BLM/BLM+ model, using ResNet-18 as the pretrained model. The results are shown in Table 1.\n**Table 1.

This additional cost is minimal, as shown by the 4th-6th columns in Table 2.\n\n(2) **Time Consumption of Updating Mapping Matrix $\\omega$ per Epoch:** The baseline method FLM calculates the mapping $\\omega$ once and keeps it fixed, while ILM and our methods update $\\omega$ at each step. However, updating $\\omega$ does not require running the model to obtain current predictions each epoch. Instead, predictions from the most recent epoch can be reused. As a result, there is no noticeable time overhead for updating $\\omega$ per epoch, as indicated by the 3rd-6th columns in Table 2.\n\n(3) **Time Consumption Compared with Finetuning Methods:** Since BLM/BLM+ use **fewer parameters** and **converge in fewer epochs**, they are significantly faster than finetuning the last layer or the entire model. This is demonstrated in the 7th-10th columns of Table 2.\n\n---\n\n**Common Question 2:** Detailed Explanations of Conditional Probabilities in Section 4.1\n\n**Response 2:** Eq. (6) and (7) aim to estimate $p(Y^{\\rm T} = y^{\\rm T}, Y^{\\rm S} = y^{\\rm S} \\mid X^{\\rm T})$ and $p(Y^{\\rm S} = y^{\\rm S} \\mid X^{\\rm T})$ respectively. Here, $X^{\\rm T} \\in \\mathcal{X}^{\\rm T}$ represents a variable from the downstream task input space, while $Y^{\\rm T} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm T}$ and $Y^{\\rm S} \\in \\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm S}$ are variables from the target and source label spaces, respectively.\n\nThe conditional probability $p(Y^{\\rm T} = y^{\\rm T}, Y^{\\rm S} = y^{\\rm S} \\mid X^{\\rm T})$ represents the joint distribution of $Y^{\\rm T}$ and $Y^{\\rm S}$, given the input reprogramming $f_{\\rm in}$, the pretrained model $f_{\\rm pre}$, and the variable $X^{\\rm T}$ of the downstream task. Similarly, $p(Y^{\\rm S} = y^{\\rm S} \\mid X^{\\rm T})$ represents the distribution of $Y^{\\rm S}$ under these conditions.\n\nFor example, consider the following setup:\n- $\\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm T} = \\lbrace\\tt Cat, \\tt Dog\\rbrace$,\n- $\\mathcal{Y}^{\\rm S} = \\lbrace\\tt CockerSpaniel, \\tt EnglishSpringer, \\tt EgyptianCat\\rbrace$,\n- Downstream samples are $ \\lbrace(x_1, {\\tt Dog}), (x_2, {\\tt Dog}), (x_3, {\\tt Dog}), (x_4, {\\tt Cat})\\rbrace$.\n\nIf the reprogrammed predictions calculated by $f_{\\rm pre}(f_{\\rm in}(x_i \\mid \\theta))$ are $\\lbrace x_1: {\\tt CockerSpaniel}, x_2: {\\tt CockerSpaniel}, x_3: {\\tt EnglishSpringer}, x_4: {\\tt EgyptianCat}\\rbrace$, then $p(Y^{\\rm T} = y^{\\rm T}, Y^{\\rm S} = y^{\\rm S} \\mid X^{\\rm T})$ can be estimated as a 2 \\* 3 matrix with the following nonzero values:\n- $p(Y^{\\rm T} = {\\tt Dog}, Y^{\\rm S} = {\\tt CockerSpaniel} \\mid X^{\\rm T}) = \\frac{1}{2}$,\n- $p(Y^{\\rm T} = {\\tt Dog}, Y^{\\rm S} = {\\tt EnglishSpringer} \\mid X^{\\rm T}) = \\frac{1}{4}$,\n- $p(Y^{\\rm T} = {\\tt Cat}, Y^{\\rm S} = {\\tt EgyptianCat} \\mid X^{\\rm T}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.'}}, 'id': '3g7esKnAPi', 'forum': '135eKqDoRR', 'replyto': '135eKqDoRR', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7993/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7993/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7993/-/Author_Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722993479857, 'cdate': 1722993479857, 'tmdate': 1730888478931, 'mdate': 1730888478931, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'Pretrained models play a crucial role in current machine learning and computer vision tasks, and effectively leveraging them in downstream tasks has become increasingly important.

However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction remains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous visual experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to addressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level semantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response to video stimuli. To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

We also evaluated NeuroClips with Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) metrics, and the results are shown in the table below (All results are averages of 3 subjects). Notably, NeuroClips' performance at the ST-level far exceeds that of MinD-Video, and even more than pixel-level, which further indicates that NeuroClips has a smoother video reconstruction capability.\n\n| Method|ST-SSIM|SSIM|ST-PSNR|PSNR|VIF|\n| - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| MinD-Video |0.489|0.171|11.595|8.662|0.113|\n| NeuroClips | **0.785** | **0.390** | **17.200** | **9.211** | **0.170** |\n\n\nAs commonly used evaluation metrics in the field of **video generation**, *Fréchet Video Distance (FVD)* is more often used to assess the performance of video diffusion generation models. However, since we **freeze** the pre-trained parameters of the advanced generation model *Animatediff* [1], the effect of our video generation model must be better than the previous video models. Therefore, the evaluations on these video metrics may not be a **fair** one. Instead, we consider the CLIP rerepsentations for evaluation. Note that the consistency in CLIP representation space is more revealing of the degree of **semantic consistency**, reflecting the superiority of Semantic Reconstructor (SR) in NeuroClips. \nIn the table above, we conducted an evaluation using the Visual Information Fidelity metric (VIF), instead of the FVD metric. When assessing FVD, all of Pytorch's open-source methods necessitate a video frame rate exceeding 10fps due to their need for some level of downsampling. Despite NeuroClips making significant advancements in frame rate, it falls to meet this requirement. \n\n[1] Animatediff: Animate your personalized text-to-image diffusion models without specific tuning, *ICLR 2024*\n\n> **Question 9: Difference Voxel Weight Visualization**\n\nWe will add a third row with the difference between the weights of subjects as described in *Question 3*, thanks again!\n\n> **Question 10: Voxel Selcetion**\n\nIn fact, we did **not** select voxels **specifically for the visual cortex**. We calculated the voxel-wise correlation between the fMRI voxel signals of each training movie repetition for each subject. **The significant voxels**(Bonferroni correction, **P < 0.05**) were considered to be **stimulus-activated voxels** and used for subsequent analysis, as described in the pre-processing paragraphs of **Section 4.1**. We agree with you that other brain regions may also contribute to video decoding as well, so we expanded the range of significance (**MinD-Video using P < 0.01**), and the voxels used in NeuroClips are more than MinD-Video. The following table shows the number of voxels selected by the two methods.\n\n|Method|Subject 1|Subject 2| Subject 3|\n|-|-|-|-|\n| MinD-Video|6016| 6224|3744|\n| NeuroClips|13447|14828|9114|\n\nWe believe that our voxel-selective paradigm is more easily migrated to other fMRI decoding tasks and provides a more comprehensive neurobiological perspective.\n\n> **Question 11: Trade-off Between PR & SR**\n\nDue to the parallel design of our Semantic Reconstructor (SR) and Perception Reconstructor (PR), SR focuses more on the decoding of **video semantics**, while PR is more geared towards the reconstruction of **pixel-level information**. SR can significantly improve semantic-related metrics, and PR can improve pixel-level related metrics. So in the end, when the two are combined together, there is a trade-off between semantic and perception reconstruction. During training, the Video Diffusion model will achieve a compromise effect between semantic and perception reconstruction. We will provide more discussions and deeper insighs on the compromise effect.\n\n> **Question 12: Low-level Visual Details**\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We willl modify it to '***MinD-Video lacks design of low-level visual detailing, so it significantly diverges from the brain’s visual system, exhibiting limitations in perceiving continuous low-level visual details.***'\n\n> **Question 13: Persistence of Vision**\n\nThanks for your suggestion.

In the current version of NeuroClips, which employs a fixed 4-second delay, it was observed that the semantics of some of the generated keyframes exhibited latency, particularly in instances where the video clips of the scene were of a **greater duration**. Accordingly, a **sliding window** comprising two or three fMRI frames was devised to actively learn the aforementioned delay. However, it was discovered that employing a sliding window resulted in a **notable reduction** in the final evaluation metrics, with a **more pronounced negative impact**, particularly in the case of shorter video clips. It may be the case that longer videos have a more enduring effect on human brain fMRI signals. In light of the experimental outcomes, we ultimately opted to discard this methodology and instead fix the delay. \n\n> **Question 2: Ridge Regression**\n\nAs you mentioned, the human brain processes information in a highly complex and non-linear way. However, empirical evidence [1, 2, 3] underscores the **effectiveness and sufficiency of linear mapping** for achieving desirable reconstruction outcomes. Notably, **complex nonlinear models will easily overfit to fMRI noise**, leading to poor performance in the test set [4].

For each subgraph, the weights of the voxels were visualized after normalization, with **brighter regions** representing **higher weights** and **darker regions** representing **lower weights**. For subject 3, the distribution of voxel weights in PR and SR is quite different. For example, in the right region of V4 of the right brain, PR is brighter and SR is darker.

We value each of your suggestions and provide the following responses:\n\n> **Weakness 1: Light Variations**\n\nWe highlight that **light variations** are also a feature that distinguishes video from images. Our initial hypothesis was that this phenomenon was caused by the presence of partial light variations in the blurred video of the Perception Reconstructor (PR). However, subsequent experiments involving the **removal** of the blurred video revealed that the effect persisted. This may be caused by the pre-training of AnimateDiff, where a corresponding discussion will be further explored in the final version of the paper. It is still important to emphasise that although the phenomenon exists, it is only observed in a **limited number** of videos.\n\n\n> **Weakness 2: Longer and High-frame Videos**\n\n+ **From the Dataset.** After counting the video clips in our dataset, we discovered that the longest video spanned merely around 10 seconds. Hence, there is no need to reconstruct videos that extend up to a minute in duration.\n\n+ **From an availability standpoint.** Currently, the most cutting-edge video generation technology has now advanced to create longer videos, like **`Sora`**. However, the quality of the generated content still raises concerns due to the current limitations of the technology. Additionally, it's important to highlight that the majority of these technologies are **not open source.**\n\n+ **From a Research Perspective.** fMRI-to-video reconstruction is an emerging field. At this critical stage, we believe that the applicability and scalability of innovative methods are of greater consequence. Empirically, once longer blurred videos or video generation tools are available, **NeuroClips** can generate **24-frame and longer videos**. However, this will **remarkably increase the GPU usage**. From a research standpoint, we believe that the current reconstructed video is impressive and sufficient.\n\n> **Question 1: Hemodynamic Delay**\n\nIndeed, a considerable number of **exploratory experiments** have been conducted to study **hemodynamic delay**, a topic also considered in Mind-Video. In the current version of NeuroClips, with a fixed 4-second delay, it was observed that the semantics of some of the generated keyframes exhibited latency, particularly in instances where the video clips of the scene were of a **greater duration**. To address this, a **sliding window** comprising two or three fMRI frames was devised for the purpose of actively learning the aforementioned delay. It was discovered that the application of a sliding window resulted in a **notable reduction** in the final evaluation metrics, with a **more pronounced negative impact**, particularly in the case of shorter video clips. It may be the case that longer videos have a more enduring effect on human brain fMRI signals. In light of the experimental outcomes, we ultimately opted to discard this approach and instead maintain a fixed delay.\n\n> **Question 2: Cross-Subject**\n\nYes, it is necessary to train a **distinct** model for each subject when using NeuroClips. As cross-subject approaches in this area still fail to achieve satisfactory results, we finally choose to utilise and explore a **single-subject** model in this paper. However, in light of the recent advancements in **fMRI-to-image reconstruction**, a series of cross-subject models have emerged [1, 2, 3]. We believe that extending NeuroClips to encompass cross-subject content will be a **promising avenue** for future research.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Mindbridge: A cross-subject brain decoding framework, *CVPR 2024*.\n\n[2] Psychometry: An omnifit model for image reconstruction from human brain activity, *CVPR 2024*.\n\n[3] MindEye2: Shared-Subject Models Enable fMRI-To-Image With 1 Hour of Data, *ICML 2024*\n\n> **Question 3: Low Quality of Dataset**\n\nSince both NeuroClips and the previous baselines are founded upon the **same dataset**, the ensuing comparison is deemed to be **equitable**. The assertion that the CC2017 dataset is of poor quality is intended to **highlight** the difficulty in achieving impressive fMRI-to-video reconstruction results in **comparison to fMRI-to-image reconstruction**. The capacity to produce superior outcomes on datasets of inferior quality serves to illustrate the **resilience** of the NeuroClips' method. It would be of interest to ascertain whether NeuroClips could achieve even more impressive results with a higher-quality dataset.\n\n\n> **Question 4: Enhancement from Text Modality**\n\nConsidering that the diffusion prior loss is rooted in MSE at the representation level, this prior is inherently **unstable** and the semantic information is susceptible to **bias**. It is important to recognise that text modality possesses its own **distinctive characteristics** and **robust semantic support**, which serve to complement the image representation space. To enrich the semantic depth of the representation, we strategically place text assistance subsequent to the prior.\n\n&nbsp;\n***\nYou have offered many constructive and valuable suggestions, making our submission more solid and complete.

Your effort has ensured that our submission received adequate attention and review. We address the questions and clarify the issues accordingly as described below.\n\n> **Weakness 1: NeuroClips Fails to Accurately Follow the Ground Truth Movement**\n\n+ Thanks for pointing out your concern. The fMRI-to-video decoding task presents significant challenges related to both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level motion perception. On the one hand, fMRI data is characterized by its high dimensionality, with hundreds of thousands of voxel signals captured across the entire brain. Even after rigorous voxel selection processes, approximately 10,000 voxels remain. On the other hand, fMRI data is heavily influenced by human behavior in response to visual stimuli, resulting in an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n+ The aforementioned hurdles complicate the decoding of precise and comprehensive ground truth movement from fMRI data in fMRI-to-video reconstruction. Nevertheless, through this endeavor, we present elaborated designed components and loss functions tailored for motion perception. These refinements enable NeuroClips to efficiently capture motion details and show impressive video reconstruction results. It is a valuable and motivating contribution to the fMRI decoding community. Further elaboration on these advancements is presented in the following responses.\n\n> **Question 1: No Model or Loss Function for Movement**\n\n***NeuroClips is equipped with a specific model design and a tailored loss function, which guarantees its ability in capturing motion information.***\n\n* **Regarding Model Design.** The Perception Reconstructor (PR) module we designed can perceive movement (motion) information. In this work, we focus on capturing ***generic motion*** within videos by modeling the motion information from ***two perspectives***: perceiving the ***structured information within frames*** (pertaining to objects' shape, position, and orientation) and grasping the ***dynamic information across frame sequences*** (related to the movements of an object or the dynamics of the scene). To accomplish this, we introduce a spatio-temporal attention module within **Temporal Upsampling**, which is explicitly designed to decode spatiotemporal (structural-dynamic) details, i.e., motion cues, from fMRI data. We utilize the cues to guide the Video Diffusion model toward a more nuanced perception of motion dynamics, ultimately guaranteeing the motion-awareness of the video generation of NeuroClips. This is our meticulous design from the model perspective for capturing movement (motion) information.\n\n* **Regarding Loss Function.** The Mean Absolute Error (**`MAE`**) part within the loss function (**Eq. 1**) quantifies the disparity between the generated video and the groundtruth video frame-by-frame, facilitating the perception of generic motion within videos. Note that the perception embeddings of video frames, denoted as $\\mathbf{E}_\\mathcal{X}$, are aligned to the latent space of the Stable Diffusion Variational Autoencoder, which can be the equivalent of the pixel space at the frame level. Numerous recent video generation models have shown that the effective perception of generic motion can be achieved through two fundamental yet straightforward designs: **temporal attention mechanisms** and **frame-level loss functions** [1, 2]. Consequently, the design inspiration is embraced in this study.\n\n* **Regarding Experimental Evidences.** In **Figure 3**, the turtle's swimming direction, the airplane's orientation and flight direction, and the motorcycle rider's posture, along with their corresponding motion details, are **accurately reproduced**. If NeuroClips be exclusively crafted at a semantic level, it becomes evident that semantics alone are inadequate for capturing these motions. In addition, the exceptional accuracy of NeuroClips, as evidenced by the **pixel-level** and **ST-level** metrics in **Table 1**, further corroborates these visualization outcomes.\n\n* **Regarding Fine-grained Motion Decoding.** Currently, decoding fine-grained movements from fMRI data poses a **significant challenge** due to its **intricate and noisy nature**. Unlike text, fMRI data lacks straightforward cues such as motion-descriptive words, making the motion perception more complex. NeuroClips stands apart from previous text-to-video models that are capable of generating motions closely aligning with textual motion semantics. Note that NeuroClips has achieved significant progress in fMRI-to-video decoding tasks. Certainly, NeuroClips is by no means the final solution for fMRI-to-video decoding tasks; undoubtedly, superior solutions will emerge in the future. Looking ahead, there are **promising prospects** for enhancing the accuracy of decoding **fine-grained** movements from fMRI data in the future. This will be the focal point of our upcoming efforts.\n\n\n> **Question 2: Code Release**\n\nWe promise to release the code at the earliest opportunity, following the acceptance of the paper. We appreciate and support open source because it helps more researchers contribute to the field and advances its development. This is an effective way to further enhance the significance and value of our research.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Stable video diffusion: Scaling latent video diffusion models to large datasets, *Stability AI*\n\n[2] Align your latents: High-resolution video synthesis with latent diffusion models, *CVPR 2023*\n\n&nbsp;\n***\nYou have offered many constructive and valuable suggestions, making our submission more solid and complete.

In particular, you have provided us with more than twenty constructive suggestions and insightful questions, which is extremely precious at a time when the quality of reviews in the community is deteriorating. We value each of your suggestions and provide the following responses:\n\n> **Weakness 1: Details of Multi-fMRI Fusion**\n\nWe acknowledge and accept your suggestion. Considering that Multi-fMRI Fusion is merely an extra merit of NeuroClips and the page limitations, we were unable to present more details regarding multi-fMRI fusion.\nThanks to the design of keyframes in the Semantic Reconstructor (SR), Multi-fMRI Fusion can be effectively achieved. In this study, we obtain the CLIP representations of reconstructed neighboring keyframes and train a shallow MLP based on the representations to distinguish whether two frames share the same class. The exact process is also shown as the GIF in the code repository. This training process operates at the image level. Despite our efforts to assess whether neighboring fMRI frames belong to the same scene class at the fMRI frame level using an MLP with fMRI frames as inputs, aiming for fMRI anomaly detection, our results were suboptimal, as illustrated in the following table. As can be seen, the fMRI level analysis frequently led to excessive false fusions. Conversely, established techniques for categorizing images perform reliably, particularly within the proficient CLIP space we employ.\nWe promise to include more technical details in the final version. Thank you for your suggestion.\n\n| Fusion-level            | Subject 1 | Subject 2 | Subject 3 |\n| ----------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |\n| fMRIs                   | 59.7%     | 58.8%     | 57.2%     |\n| Reconstructed keyframes | **86.3%** | **87.1%** | **85.6%** |\n\n> **Weakness 2: Rapid Scene Change**\n\n**We will present four perspectives on the inability of NeuroClips to perceive rapid changes in the scene**\n\n* **Regarding Dataset.** The rapid scene change depicted in the code repository is a **distinct** alteration influenced by **human intervention**, diverging from authentic real-world visuals. In the CC2017 dataset, video sequences were randomly divided into discrete segments, then amalgamated and presented to subjects. Such spliced videos are seldom encountered in everyday visual encounters, as scenes typically unfold continuously. This is what we have mentioned in Limitation about *cross-scene fMRI*.\n\n* **From the fMRI Data.** We must acknowledge that **continuous** scene transitions occur in actual visual perception, such as when a person turns their head. However, it remains unknown whether and how rapid scene changes occurring within an fMRI frame (e.g., 2 seconds) are reflected in the fMRI signal due to its intricate nature. Consequently, decoding scene changes from fMRI data poses a significant challenge.\n\n* **From Keyframe Design.** When scene changes occur within one fMRI frame (e.g., 2s), the design of the keyframes may adequately capture it, although the blurred video would be continuous. However, the keyframe-based method to guide the generation of continuous video can serve as a foundation for the subsequent design of decoding two consecutive scenes separated rapid scene change.\n\n* **From Cross-scene Diffusion Models.**  Presently, most of the current video generation diffusion models are not capable of very silky smooth scene switching, like SORA, to the best of our knowledge. We believe that, from a technical point of view, the issue can be better alleviated if consecutive semantics can be decoded from a single fMRI frame, or if the temporal resolution of fMRI can be refined.\n\nThanks again for your suggestions. We will provide the results of some of our exploratory experiments and a detailed discussion in the final version.\n\n> **Weakness 3: Generalization Capability**\n\n**Diverse real-world video content**. The videos in the CC2017 dataset used are, somehow, sufficiently reflective of real-world visual experiences. As the original dataset paper states 'All video clips were chosen from Videoblocks and YouTube to be diverse yet. For example, individual video clips showed people in action, moving animals, nature scenes, outdoor or indoor scenes, etc' [1]. \n\n**Diversity of fMRI recordings.** To ensure consistency with the baselines [2] and to make a fair comparison, we experimented on the dataset, which unfortunately has only 3 subjects. We appreciate you pointing out that this should at least be mentioned in Limitations, and we will add it in the final version. Publicly available datasets for fMRI-to-video reconstruction are valuable and not easy to find. Until now, we discovered that the Algonauts 2021 [3] dataset can also be used for video reconstruction, but it is a great pity that this dataset is currently in an unpublished stage. To show the generalization capability of our approach, we finally chose to perform fMRI-to-image reconstruction on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) [4] to assess the keyframe effect of our Semantic Reconstructor (SR). The visual results of the reconstructed image and groundtruth images are shown in the **`PDF`** appendix. Notably, our method exhibited satisfactory reconstruction outcomes even when applied to fMRI data with a distinct distribution, signifying the generalization capabilities of NeuroClips.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Neural encoding and decoding with deep learning for dynamic natural vision, *Cerebral cortex 2018*\n\n[2] Cinematic mindscapes: High-quality video reconstruction from brain activity, *NeurIPS 2023*\n\n[3] The algonauts project 2021 challenge: How the human brain makes sense of a world in motion, *2021*\n\n[4] A massive 7T fMRI dataset to bridge cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence, *Nature neuroscience 2022*""}}, 'id': 'pVYE3yqqSI', 'forum': '8qu52Fl1Dt', 'replyto': 'ECK6k8YsaE', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission351/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission351/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission351/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722757805741, 'cdate': 1722757805741, 'tmdate': 1730880401041, 'mdate': 1730880401041, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'This paper proposes NeuroClips, a framework that decodes high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI.

The pipeline with chosen keyframe might hinder the NeuroClips  to catch this rapid change in the video. No ablation is done in this direction, which could explain how neural NeuroClips decodes fMRI signals. \n\n- The paper primarily evaluates the method on a specific dataset (with only 3 patients), which, obviously, may not fully capture the diversity of real-world video content and fMRI recordings.This should be at least mentioned in the Discussion (or Conclusion) of the work.\n\n - The neurobiological justification of keyframe usage seems ambiguous.

However, the brain's processing of visual information is highly nonlinear and complex. At least, it should be mentioned in the Limitations too.\n\n- Fig 12: The weights of subject 3 are really similar for PR and SR tasks, can you elaborate on it?\n - Fig 2: Example images are too small to perceive it even with a zoom, I recommend to make them bigger (as in Fig 7).\n- I recommend adding the major limitations in the Conclusion section of the main text.\n\n- Authors should include in the Supplement section which software was used to build brain maps with weights and if any data pre-processing/normalization was applied.\n\n- Lines 75-76: “NeuroClips achieves a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics and also performs better overall on most video semantic-level metrics.” -  report not only the percent of improvement, but also the values of the metrics.\n\n- In the frame validation the main image quality metrics are PSNR and SSIM. Authors should mention that those metrics have flaws (Zhang et al, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Deep Features as a Perceptual Metric, 2018). Will it be possible to consider other quality evaluation metrics? Like, for example, Visual information fidelity metrics (Sheikh et al., Image information and visual quality, 2006). It is also interesting why PSNR and SSIM were used for frames-based evaluation but not for video-based evaluation with modification to catch spatio-temporal data (ST-PSNR and ST-SSIM)? Another question is why authors choose to evaluate performance only with “CLIP image embeddings on each frame” and omit other metrics like Fréchet Video Distance (FVD), MSE or already mentioned ST-PSNR and ST-SSIM?\n\n- Fig 12: The visualization of voxel weights on a brain flat map to interpret neural activity is a significant strength. However, now it is difficult to comprehend the differences in weights from the image with naked eyes. The addition of a third row with the difference between the weights of participants can increase the clarity of what authors are trying to say.\n\n- The study focuses primarily on the visual cortex. While this is appropriate for the simplest visual stimuli (i.e., dots, simple geometrics shapes, etc.), it may limit the generalization of the approach to other types of brain activity or cognitive functions. Discussing potential extensions to other brain regions and types of neural data could provide a more comprehensive neurobiological perspective.\n\n-  Lines 316-318: “From the quantitative results, it can be seen that there is a trade-off between semantic and perception reconstruction” - there is no clear explanation or reasoning why there is a trade-off between SR and PR\n\n- Line 38: “However, the visual decoding of MinD-Video significantly diverges from the brain’s visual system, exhibiting limitations in perceiving continuous low-level visual details.” - the more precise listing of what hinders MinD-Video to perceiving continuous low-level visual details would be more constructive, rather than comparison with the brain's visual system. \n\n- Lines 41-42: “Notably, the human brain perceives videos discretely [8, 9] due to the persistence of vision [10, 11] and delayed memory [12].”\n\t1. discretely -> discreetly\n\t2.  Was it intentional to use the paper [10] of 1892 year for the “persistence of vision” concept? Also, the fact that the brain has a “persistence of vision” was criticized. Actually, the second citation you’ve used [11] is the critique of this concept (J Anderson et al., The myth of persistence of vision revisited, 1993). The citations of the novel research papers are required to justify this statement.\n\t\nThe paper will be significantly improved by more valid justification of claimed neurobiological concepts. \n\n\nMinor:\n- Line 644: “However, these limitations will not be tackled overnight” - this phrase is informal and somewhat colloquial, which may not be entirely appropriate for a scientific paper\n- Line 56: “This process is reflected in the fMRI signal” - can you provide the link to the paper supporting this statement?\n- Line 129: “...loss to train the PR, the overall loss L_{PR} of PR can be donated as…” - “donated” is a confusing word to use, please use another word.\n\n-  Lines: 222-223: “Since the technical field of long video generation is still immature, we chose a more straightforward fusion strategy that” - can not see why immatureness of the field can be used as a reason to use a straightforward strategy.

To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

It consists of two components, i.e., a cross-decoder stacked upon a self-decoder. The self-decoder efficiently encodes global key-value (KV) caches that are reused by the cross-decoder via cross-attention. The overall model behaves like a decoder-only Transformer, although YOCO only caches once. The design substantially reduces GPU memory demands, yet retains global attention capability. Additionally, the computation flow enables prefilling to early exit without changing the final output, thereby significantly speeding up the prefill stage. Experimental results demonstrate that YOCO achieves favorable performance compared to Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and number of training tokens. We also extend YOCO to 1M context length with near-perfect needle retrieval accuracy. The profiling results show that YOCO improves inference memory, prefill latency, and throughput by orders of magnitude across context lengths and model sizes.","Oral Session 6D: Deep Learning Architecture, Infrastructure",https://openreview.net/pdf?id=25Ioxw576r,https://openreview.net/forum?id=25Ioxw576r,25Ioxw576r,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'This paper proposes a novel decoder-only architecture that uses only one layer global KV cache to improve inference efficiency.

First, KV cache can be shared across layers without significantly affecting language modeling performance. Most previous work focuses on compressing KV cache along with the sequence dimension, while YOCO improves the cache issues from another perspective, i.e., the layers. Second, the hybrid design is competitive. After the NeurIPS submission, there were several concurrent works indicate this insight, such as Samba, and character.ai's architecture blog. Third, the early exit insight (as described in Figure 2 and Line 115) dramatically improves the prefill speed. All the above insights and advantages make YOCO novel and go beyond conventional KV compression methods, which improves deployment and user experience.\n\n\n---\n>Q2: How the efficient self-attention and decoder-decoder structure affect the model's performance respectively.\n\nA2: \n\n- The comparisons between decoder-decoder and decoder-only architectures are presented in Table 6, i.e., the settings `YOCO_[1:1]` and `Interleaved & Hybrid`, where the interleaved model is a decoder-only architecture with hybrid layers. The results show that the two layouts achieve similar performance. \n\n- For different self-decoder choices, we conducted experiments with sliding-window attention and gated retention. Both representative design choices work well as shown in Figure 3 (i.e., model size scaling up experiments) and Table 5 (i.e., ablation studies).\n\n- Different ratios between self-decoder and cross-decoder are also compared in Table 6.\n\n- In order to comprehensively inspect how the proposed architecture affects performance, we conducted evaluation from diverse perspectives, including scale up training tokens (Section 4.1), scaling curves of the proposed architectures (Section 4.2),  scale up the YOCO model to 1M context length and evaluate its long-sequence modeling capability (Section 4.3), compare with Transformer variants (Section 4.5), and ablation studies on various design choices (Section 4.6).\n\n\n---\n>Q3: what contributes to the performance improvement?\n\nA3: The improvements mainly come from the hybrid-style architecture. Multiple recent works confirmed this point, such as Samba[1], and Jamba[2]. The trends are consistent across different learning rate schedules. Because YOCO saves the key and value projection matrices, for fair comparisons, we accordingly increase the FFN part in order to keep the overall parameter count similar across models. For example, as shown in the page 47 of the Llama 2 paper[3], this is a common practice for fair comparisons across design choices. Besides, instead of performance, we focus more on the improvements in terms of inference memory, prefill latency, and throughput.\n\n[1] Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n[2] Jamba: A Hybrid Transformer-Mamba Language Model\n\n[3] Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models\n\n\nWe hope the above explanation clarifies the rationale behind our experiment designs.

You are correct in noting that it incurs additional computational overhead due to the necessity of computing the inverse and determinant of covariance matrices. The time complexity of Algorithm 2 is $O(nkd^3T)$, where $n$ is the number of points, $d$ is the dimensionality of each data point, $k$ is the number of clusters, and $T$ is the number of iterations. This contrasts with the vanilla Lloyd's algorithm, which has a lower time complexity of $O(nkdT)$. The increased complexity is primarily due to the matrix operations in $d$ dimensions, which scale as $O(d^3)$ for matrix inversion and determinant computation. To provide a clearer perspective on the performance impact, our experiments show that at a dimensionality of 5, Algorithm 2 requires approximately twice the computation time of the vanilla Lloyd’s algorithm.

The ""ideal error"" is defined as the error remaining after one algorithm iteration with known ground truth $z^*$. It represents the minimum error under ideal conditions.

On one hand, this condition helps simplify the complexity for establishing the lower bound. As noted in the literature you referenced, a more refined analysis might allow us to relax this assumption to simply $\\text{SNR} \\gg 1$. On the other hand, this condition is essential to establish a matching upper bound. The ideal error analysis does not explicitly require this assumption; however, it becomes necessary when considering the aggregate impact of errors $F$, $G$, and $H$. These components introduce multiple factors of $k$ that appear before the desired exponential term, and the assumption ensures that these factors remain negligible.\n\n> Line 42 the sentence:\n\nThank you for the question. To address it, consider a simpler case with two Gaussian distributions: whether the SNR calculated from $N(\\theta^*_1, \\Sigma^*_1)$ and $N(\\theta^*_2, \\Sigma^*_2)$ is always larger than that from $N(\\theta^*_1, \\Sigma^*_1)$ and $N(\\theta^*_2, \\Sigma^*_1)$. In this case, the answer to your question is not necessarily yes, as demonstrated by the following counterexample. When $\\theta^*_1=(0,0)$, $\\theta^*_2=(1,0)$, $\\Sigma^*_1 = I_2$ and $\\Sigma^*_2$ is a diagonal matrix with 2 in its (1,1) entry and 1 in its (2,2) entry, one can verify SNR is not larger. In fact, the effect of replacing $\\Sigma^*_2$ with $\\Sigma^*_1$ on SNR depends on the shapes of $\\Sigma^*_1$ and $\\Sigma^*_2$ and the direction of $\\theta^*_2 - \\theta^*_1$. This is different from the sub-Gaussian setting. The rationale why $N(0, \\sigma^2 I_d)$ leads to the smallest SNR among sub-Gaussian distributions with variance proxy $\\sigma^2$ is that it is flatter in all directions compared to any other sub-Gaussian distribution.\n\n> I am not sure how to obtain the second to last inequality of the inequations starting line 473. \n\nThe inequality does not result directly from Cauchy-Schwarz. Instead, it first formulates a quadratic form and then upper bounds it by the operator norm of the matrix. Let $x$ be a vector. The inequality is essentially about showing $\\sum_j |\\epsilon_j^Tx|^2$ can be upper bounded by $||x||^2 ||\\sum_j \\epsilon_j \\epsilon_j^T||$. This can be proved by\n$\\sum_j |\\epsilon_j^Tx|^2 = \\sum_j (x^T\\epsilon_j)(\\epsilon_j^T x) = \\sum_j x^T(\\epsilon_j \\epsilon_j^T)x = x^T(\\sum_j \\epsilon_j \\epsilon_j^T)x \\leq ||x||^2 ||\\sum_j \\epsilon_j \\epsilon_j^T||$.

For example, the error decomposition with the terms F, G, H etc appears mysterious and a bit out of nowhere.

For example, line 435 embodies exactly my feeling while reading the proofs: ""We next define a quantity that refers to as the ideal error""; yes this quantity is important, yet I do not tell explicitly why and I leave the reader to understand himself why this is indeed an ideal error. \n\n* The interpretation of the minimax rate for model 2 is quite complex.

Especially, the authors consider spectral clustering, which does not scale as well as iterative methods such as Lloyd\'s. Moreover, spectral clustering is rate-optimal in an isotropic mixture model. A natural question is: what happens if one takes the best over 10 runs over random initialisation \\hat z^{(0)} (or something more clever such as k-means++)? Numerical simulations could show whether a strong condition on the initialisation is indeed needed or not.

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics that break down evaluation into error types, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, and various types of planning errors.

As detailed in **Appendix Section L.6 Prompt Analysis and Learned Lessons** (L2131-L2143), we follow the convention established by [1] and other works. It provides a **fair** and **scalable** evaluation setting for LLM/VLMs, aligned with the principle that large models should exhibit more **generalist** capabilities. We agree with this convention because our evaluation aims to improve LLMs for embodied agents. So performance should be assessed from the perspective of **embodied AI experts**, who may not prefer extensive and expert-level prompt engineering.\n* Please note that we have thoroughly considered the potential effects of prompt variation on different large language models. The prompts we use result from many iterations of **empirical testing on all LLMs**, ensuring that all models can adequately understand the prompt and **no model would incur a format error rate of > 3.8%**.\n* We provide **ablations of various aspects of prompt design** in Appendix Section L.6 Prompt Analysis and Learned Lessons (e.g. GPT-4o often does not require chain-of-thought explicitly to perform reasoning tasks effectively).\n* Following your suggestion, we have added experiments on **tuning the model-specific prompt** for goal interpretation task on VirtualHome based on the general prompt, and test on ""claude-3-opus-20240229"", ""gpt-4o-2024-05-13"", ""gemini-1.5-pro-preview-0409"". We named the prompt in the following way: \n    * 1) `base`, `general` and `general_improved` are the three versions of prompts we used in previous benchmark development. We started from `base`, and finalized on the final version of `general_improved` prompt, based on which all our results are reported in the paper. \n    * 2) {model_name}\\_{number} are the model-specific prompts we tuned for each {model_name} with TOP\\_{number} performance gain. \n    * We present **heatmap results in the attached [PDF](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=440TO7Rhvv&name=pdf)**. Our findings indicate that model-specific prompts do not lead to significant differences. For example, in the [figures](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=440TO7Rhvv&name=pdf), when Claude performs best with certain prompts, these prompts are also among the top performed prompts for other models. This suggests that prompt improvements can be generalized across large models, supporting our initial point.\n\n[1] Liang, Bommasani, Lee, et al.

Many simulators that only support control-level inputs, such as ALFRED, ManiSkill, RoboSuite, and Isaac Gym with much shorter horizons do not align with our goals.\n* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: We have ensured that our evaluation interface is generic enough; however, not every simulator natively supports all of our evaluation in four ability modules, e.g. , Minecraft does not provide specific goals and tasks, which makes it less suitable for our study.

As this field progresses, the insights from our benchmark will become increasingly relevant for practical implementations.\n* The relational graphs are widely used in robotics, which allows us to evaluate decision making capabilities directly, without the added complexity of perception tasks. This approach enables us to isolate and analyze the LLM\'s planning and reasoning skills specifically.\n* The scene graphs we used in Behavior and VirtualHome are pretty simple, as listed in Appendix Table 17 and Appendix Table 18. \n\n[1] Kurenkov, et al. “Semantic and Geometric Modeling with Neural Message Passing in 3D Scene Graphs for Hierarchical Mechanical Search” ICRA 2021\\\n[2] Rosinol, et al. “Kimera: an Open-Source Library for Real-Time Metric-Semantic Localization and Mapping” ICRA 2020\\\n[3] Gu, et al. “ConceptGraphs: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs for Perception and Planning” ICRA 2024\\\n[4] Ge, et al. “BEHAVIOR Vision Suite: Customizable Dataset Generation via Simulation” CVPR 2024\\\n[5] Agia, et al. “TASKOGRAPHY: Evaluating robot task planning over large 3D scene graphs” CoRL 2021\\\n[6] Li, et al. “Pre-Trained Language Models for Interactive Decision-Making” NeurIPS 2022\\\n[7] Lin, et al. “Text2motion: From natural language instructions to feasible plans” Autonomous Robots 2023\\\n[8] Rana, et al.

This raises fundamental questions about the specific advantages of LLMs in scenarios where structured formal planning could be more directly applicable**\n\n* The primary aim of our paper is to **evaluate** LLMs\' capabilities in decision-making to help the robotics community to use LLMs selectively. \n* We totally agree that the role of structured or symbolic representations in improving model performance remains a debating topic. However, **structured representations are valuable for model evaluation** as they offer several key advantages:\n   * _Quantization_: Enable precise measurement and comparison of model outputs\n   * _Error localization_: Pinpoint exact deviations from expected results\n   * _Standardization_: Facilitate consistent cross-model comparisons\n   * _Task-specific Assessment_: Allow for fine-grained evaluation criteria\n* This difference is crucial for understanding our methodological choices.

Also, as noted in Section 6 (Lines 308-L313), we acknowledge this limitation and pinpoint future work focusing on VLMs.\n\nWe deliberately scope our **long-horizon decision-making evaluation** in the LLM setting as it is currently **most applicable**. Existing VLMs are not designed for taking scene-level information from multiple rooms in a household environment.

Therefore, we focus on **long-horizon decision-making capability that bridges perception and control**, a common use of LLMs in embodied decision-making [4,5,6,7,8,9]. While many studies focus on short-horizon control-level tasks, we fill in the blanks here. \n\nTo explore VLMs\' long-horizon decision-making, we experiment with VLMs with multimodal input: \n- **Why we do not choose VLMs:**\nComparing Llama-3 and LLaVA (with Llama-3 as the backbone for a fair comparison), VLMs consistently underperform LLMs. The gap reveals a crucial issue: **VLMs struggle with low performance, especially in complex scenarios with multiple objects** like BEHAVIOR and VirtualHome. \n    * **(Exp.0) `scene_graph` → LLMs → `planning_output`** is the original setting in our paper.\n    * **(Exp.1) `image` → VLMs → `planning_output`** is end-to-end, without intermediate scene graphs. VLMs perform significantly worse, **entangling perception and decision-making errors**, thus making it difficult to locate decision-making errors. Evaluating VLMs this way shows reduced overall performance but does not identify specific failures in abilities like goal interpretation or transition modeling.\n    * **(Exp.2) `image` + `scene_graph` →VLMs → `planning_output`**, where the ground truth scene graph is provided and the VLM is augmented with visual signals compared to the LLM, yet still underperforms. It suggests that **VLMs are not yet able to sufficiently use multimodal input to improve long-horizon decision-making**. VLMs\' long-horizon reasoning abilities primarily stem from their language modeling components[11,12], but visual information often acts as a distractor rather than a helper due to its currently limited quality.\n    *  **VLMs (Exp.1, Exp.2) vs LLMs (Exp.0) on BEHAVIOR**\n        | | **Goal Interpretation ($F_1$)** | **Action Sequencing (Success Rate, SR %)** | \n        | :----- | :--------: | :-----: | \n        | **Llama** | 31.5 | 11.1 |\n        | **LLaVA** (w/o scene graphs) | 9.10 | 2.50 |\n        | **LLaVA** (w/ scene graphs) | 25.8 | 11.0 |\n    * As a result, we adopt a **decomposed evaluation approach** to (1) **accurately locate** current models\' strengths and weaknesses to (2) **guide LLM/VLM improvements for embodied AI**.

Apart from the annotation details described in Appendix P, did you recruit crowdworkers to label the real demonstrations? How do you verify the quality of annotations?**\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer\'s question. Following your suggestions, we have added more annotation details in Appendix P Annotation Details of the [revision](https://embodied-agent-eval.github.io/website/data/NeurIPS2024__Embodied_Agent_Interface_Evaluating_LLMs_for_Physical_Everyday_Decision_Making.pdf). \n* Annotation Process:\n    * Four authors worked on the data annotation: two for VirtualHome and two for BEHAVIOR. We used real demonstrations from the BEHAVIOR-100 dataset, then we annotated trajectories, goals, action preconditions, and post-effects using our expert knowledge. We did not use crowdworkers as the annotators are expected to have **expert knowledge of LTL, transition models**, and familiar with **simulator-supported actions**. Annotators also worked on the simulator implementation (e.g., implementing actions and transition models in BEHAVIOR, detailed in Appendix Q.1) to **ensure the annotations were executable**.\n    * To control the data quality, we have a **two-round annotation** process: a) initial annotation and b) revision round based on initial results.\n    * We also have additional rounds if needed until consensus reached on each data point.\n* Quality Verification:\n    * We have a automated verification using simulators to check consistency and correctness \n    * Based on your suggestions, we have conducted an additional human evaluation for the data annotation quality. We follow VirtualHome to design a survey to ask annotators to score 1-5 for Annotation Accuracy, Annotation Coverage, and Human Preference. We recruit 20 annotators and ask each of them to verify annotations of 10 tasks. \n    * Annotation Quality Evaluation\n      |         | Mean Score | Weighted MSE |\n      | :---------------- | :-------: |  :---------------: |\n      | **Annotation Accuracy**    | 3.73   | 0.4062        |\n      | **Annotation Coverage**    | 4.07   | 1.8438        |\n      | **Human Preference**   | 4.27  | 0.8125       |\n   * Here, weighted Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculation assesses score variability across tasks and evaluators. For multi-evaluator tasks, we calculate the MSE per attribute by averaging squared differences between individual scores and the task\'s mean. We then compute a weighted mean of these MSEs across all tasks, with weights based on evaluation frequency. This method balances individual task variability with overall assessment consistency, accounting for varying numbers of evaluations per task.\n   * We also visualize the score distribution, attached in the [PDF](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=02nzMxgA8b&name=pdf).\n\n---\n\n**[F2] Why do you ask the LLMs to generate the logical language in JSON format? How do you parse or post-process the outputs if they are not strictly formatted as JSON?**\n\nWe are happy that the reviewer brings up this question, which we carefully examined with experiments. We opted for JSON output from LLMs in our evaluation for several reasons:\n\n* We report the format errors in Table 6, where **format parsing error rate is below 1%** for top models.\n* We aim to **minimize** the involvement of **instruction following** and **disentangle** the **decision making** and instruction following. \n    * Format errors reflect instruction-following ability rather than decision-making capability. \n    * Environment representation is a **structured representation**, JSON format has been well trained for structured representation. \n* We aim to work with **different simulators**, which have varying **grammars** and **formats**. Direct prompting for specific formats often results in punctuation errors. \n    * Example: VirtualHome\'s `[action_name] <object_name>` format.\n    * Observed erroneous variations: `[FIND] phone`, `FIND \\<phone\\>`, `FIND phone`.\n    * JSON output (e.g., `{""FIND"": [""phone""]}`) eliminates these inconsistencies.\n* Ease of Post-processing:\n    * JSON format allows for simpler post-processing.\n* We performed experiments when making this design choice:\n    * We observed that LLM can handle json format very well. Taking BEHAVIOR subgoal decomposition as an example,  **1495 out of 1500 can be successfully parsed**.\n    * We found that plan output with json format has a **higher executable rate** than that with natural language format.\n    | Action Sequencing       | Executable Rate |\n| ----------------------- | --------------- |\n| Natural Language Output | 78.1            |\n| JSON Output             | 84.3            |\n\nWe have these details in the [revision](https://embodied-agent-eval.github.io/website/data/NeurIPS2024__Embodied_Agent_Interface_Evaluating_LLMs_for_Physical_Everyday_Decision_Making.pdf).'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/dea878aa02f70797a4ea5fd806708d23231e87d7.pdf'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': '---\n    \n**[Q2] main text vs appendix: Necessary content missing in main part**\n    \nThank you for pointing out this.

In Sec 2.2 (L121-129), we detail how state-action trajectories are used to verify LTL goal satisfaction, where we explain how LTL formula acts as a classifier, distinguishing successful trajectory that achieve the goal and those that fail. \nWe further elaborate in Sec 2.4 and Sec 2.5 on how this LTL-based classification is used to calculate success rates for trajectory-based components: subgoal decomposition and action sequencing.\n\nFollowing your suggestion, in our [revision](https://embodied-agent-eval.github.io/website/data/NeurIPS2024__Embodied_Agent_Interface_Evaluating_LLMs_for_Physical_Everyday_Decision_Making.pdf), we enhanced Sec 2.2, Sec 2.4, and Sec 2.5 with additional walk-through examples for a clearer demonstration of our evaluation for complex, temporally-extended goals.\n\n---\n\n**[Q2] fair comparison: models accept visual inputs vs text-based LLMs (GPT-4o vs. Mixtral)**\n\n* From an inference perspective, the comparison is designed to be fair, providing the same input to both model types, evaluating decision-making when given all available information, highlighting the core reasoning capabilities underlying the models. \n    * Decision-making abilities are key for foundation models to serve as generalist agents, regardless of training on textual or visual data. \n* From a training perspective, such comparison is meaningful to learn whether visual training data is helpful in long-horizon embodied decision making, which does not show much improvement in our results for long-horizon tasks. \n---\n\n**[Q2] focus more on understanding instructions rather than making decisions**\n\n* We **minimize the involvement of instruction following** by using LTL based goals with a standardized JSON format (Appendix L.6, L1452-1454). Natural language task instruction is **only** used for goal interpretation. Other components focus on **decision making by operating on environment-grounded symbolic goals**, **not direct instructions**.\n* We use **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** to formulate evaluation tasks (Appendix F.2) to **distinguish from instruction following abilities**. Each task can be viewed as an approximation of the MDP probability (Appendix F.3):\n   * Action Sequencing: predict a sequence of actions given symbolic goals\n   * Subgoal Decomposition: predict a sequence of states given symbolic goals\n   * Transition Modeling: predict precondition and post-effect of the action\n* Pure instruction following is primarily evaluated in Goal Interpretation, typically JSON parsing errors (error rates below 1% in Table 6).\n\n---\n\n**[Q2] why not include robot foundation models, such as RT-1 and RT-H**\n\nVision-Language-Action models (VLAs) like RT-1, RT-2 and RT-H focus on short-horizon tasks in a limited single-view scene (e.g. ""open pistachio jar"", ""move bowl away from cereal dispenser""), whereas our evaluations focus on complex, longer-horizon tasks in a large env scene (e.g. ""cleaning_up_the_kitchen"", which involves finding and using soap/rag to clean plates, cabinets and floor, storing oil in one cabinet and plates in another cabinet, and putting the fruits and vegetables in the fridge).

Real-world embodied tasks often involve sensory inputs and physical actions that text alone cannot fully capture. In the context of robot learning, a more typical scenario involves tasks described using multi-modal elements (e.g., text descriptions, goal images, etc.), where the robot must formulate a plan based on a history of observations (typically images). Consequently, I anticipate that multi-modal LLMs (e.g., vision-language models) will be preferred in future robot learning research. This perspective leads me to question the utility of evaluating purely text-based LLMs.\n\n- Additionally, by representing all elements in text, this paper overlooks various potential sources of error. For instance:\n\t- Errors stemming from perception and state estimation are not considered.\n\t- The paper assumes all actions are abstract, yet in the real world, these abstract actions (or skills) can fail, necessitating re-planning to mitigate the consequences of such failures.\n\n- This benchmark necessitates that the environment can provide relational graphs of objects, a requirement not commonly met by many existing robot learning environments and challenging to annotate. Moreover, extracting these relational graphs in real-world settings is significantly more complex, presenting additional hurdles for practical implementation.\n\n- While the use of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) for goal specification simplifies verification processes, it may oversimplify certain aspects of real-world goals that are more challenging to formalize in logical terms. It's essential to consider whether there are concepts that LTL can describe which natural language cannot. If everything is described using formal languages like LTL and PDDL, one might question the necessity of employing LLMs instead of directly utilizing Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) systems. This raises fundamental questions about the specific advantages of LLMs in scenarios where structured formal planning could be more directly applicable.\n\n- This benchmark employs a set of manually designed prompts to evaluate the LLMs. However, these prompts can be model-specific, potentially skewing the results. For instance, GPT might outperform Gemini with one prompt (Prompt A), while Gemini could excel with another (Prompt B). It's crucial to question whether the authors have considered the potential effects of such variability. Addressing this issue would help ensure that the evaluation is fair and representative of each model's capabilities across a range of scenarios, not just those tailored to specific prompts.\n\n- The study focuses on only two simulators (BEHAVIOR and VirtualHome), which may not fully represent the diversity of real-world embodied tasks.

However, beyond restrictive settings  such as tabular latent dynamics,  the fundamental statistical requirements and algorithmic principles for reinforcement learning under latent dynamics are poorly  understood.  This paper addresses the question of reinforcement learning under general latent dynamics from a  statistical and algorithmic perspective.  On the statistical side, our main negativeresult shows that most well-studied settings for reinforcement learning with function approximation become intractable when composed with rich observations; we complement this with a positive result, identifying latent pushforward coverability as ageneral condition that enables statistical tractability. Algorithmically, we develop provably efficient observable-to-latent reductions ---that is, reductions that transform an arbitrary algorithm for the  latent MDP into an algorithm that can operate on rich observations--- in two settings: one where the agent has access to hindsightobservations of the latent dynamics (Lee et al., 2023) and onewhere the agent can estimate self-predictive latent models (Schwarzer et al., 2020).

Please see responses to individual questions below.\n\n > Assuming that latent states can be uniquely decoded from the observations is a rather strong observation.\n\nIt is true that this imposes stronger assumptions on the observation-space MDP (i.e., there is no partial observability). However, this assumption is well-established in the line of research on Block MDPs and RL with rich observations and permits the design of computationally/statistically efficient algorithms in various cases (e.g. tabular latent MDPs), whereas the analogous POMDP setting would otherwise be intractable (see, e.g., the lower bound in [Krishnamurthy et al., 2016]). Our work addresses the question of generalizing the aforementioned positive results to general latent dynamics, which had remained largely unaddressed, and one of our main contributions is to show that, despite the seemingly nice structure of decodability, strong *negative results* are present. These also imply negative results for the setting *without* decodability. Thus, for many interesting classes of latent dynamics, one cannot hope to remove even this decodability assumption (without placing alternative assumptions). Nonetheless, we hope that by addressing the decodable setting, our work can serve as a starting point toward building a similar understanding for partially observed settings.\n\n> There are no experiments in the paper. Of course the contribution of this work is theoretical, but theoretical work can still benefit greatly from some simple experiments which illustrate results in their paper. [...] Do you believe there are any toy experiments which can be done to illustrate any of your results?\n\nWe acknowledge that experiments are an important next step for our results. However, let us emphasize that we believe our theoretical contributions alone are sufficient for publication, and stand on their own merits. Indeed, as is typically the case with theoretically motivated algorithms, developing practical implementations will require non-trivial adaptations and significant implementation effort; given the scope of our theoretical results, we believe it is appropriate to leave a full-scale empirical evaluation for future work. \n\nRegarding toy experiments: a classical toy experiment considered in prior works (for the latent tabular setting) is the “diabolical combination lock”  [Misra et al. ‘20, Zhang et al. ‘22, Mhammedi et al. ‘23], which consists of a small latent combination lock with very high-dimensional observations and which traditional deep RL algorithms fail to solve. For future experiments, since our representation learning oracle allow for sample-efficiency under much more complicated latent dynamics (beyond tabular), it would be interesting to design and test our algorithms on a more complicated version of this domain, which would be unsolvable by both deep RL algorithms as well as prior theoretical latent-dynamics algorithms.\n\n**Refs**\n\n1.

If this is the case, it seems like this is more a representation learning problem rather than a ""latent state"" problem. Could you add further discussion of how your formulation relates to POMDPs?\n\nIt is best to think of our use of the term “latent state” as in the sense of the second definition you mention (finding the best representation which remains unknown). However, our use of the term “latent state” is consistent with both of the definitions you mention—in fact, they are the same under the decodability assumption we consider. In detail, our problem formulation studies a restricted class of POMDPs where the emission processes are assumed to be decodable (Definition 2.1 and 2.2). This means that the dynamics are governed by the latent state (which is unobserved, as in POMDPs), but it also means that there exists a representation which can decode the unknown latent state. The decodability assumption also removes any partial observability issues. Thus, we are in the representation learning problem, where the aim is to recover the underlying latent state (of course, as we discuss in the paper, representation learning and exploration must be interleaved in our setting). We are happy to add more discussion to emphasize how our formulation relates to POMDPs, and we thank the author for this suggestion.\n\n>It would be helpful to provide an intuitive definition of decoder earlier in the paper, as it is used in the intro without much context.\n\nWe agree that this would be helpful, and thank the reviewer for the suggestion.

We address each of the individual questions below.\n\n> The authors mentioned that block MDP or factored MDP would be a special case of this general framework. Suppose we narrow down the problem to block MDP or factored MDP, can the statistical or algorithmic modularity be easier to achieve?\n\nModularity is indeed easier to achieve for Block MDPs (note that Block MDPs correspond to the case where  $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{lat}}$ is tabular, and we indicate that this setting is modular in Figure 1). In particular, for statistical modularity, there are many prior algorithms which achieve the desired sample complexity of $\\mathrm{poly}(S,A,H,\\log\\Phi)$ [Zhang et al., 2022, Mhammedi et al., 2023], which is statistically modular by our definition. Regarding factored MDPs, statistical modularity can be achieved under additional assumptions on the emission process [Misra et al., 21], but the general case remains an interesting open question. \nAs for algorithmic modularity, no prior works had studied this desiderata. However our reduction based on self-predictive representation learning (Theorem A.1) can be applied in the tabular (Block MDP) setting to achieve algorithmic modularity, as all the assumptions required by the self-predictive representation learning oracle are satisfied when the latent state space is tabular.\n\n> Similar to the previous question, what kind of structure (e.g., symmetry, disentanglement) or distribution assumptions in the latent space could mostly benefit the current theoretical framework?\n\nWe agree that this is an interesting question, and have tackled it in the paper – for example, we have identified that latent pushforward coverability is a general structural condition on the latent space which allows for statistical and algorithmic modularity (this subsumes, for example, the block MDP and latent low-rank MDP results). However, we do not yet have a complete picture of which latent structures or additional parameters are necessary and sufficient, and have posed this as an open question in the conclusion of the paper. We view the introduction of this question, along with partial steps towards addressing it, as one of our main contributions. \n\n**References**\n\n1.

The authors then go through a laundry list of MDP formalisms in previous work, and provide for most a result on whether or not they are statistically modular.

The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) sheds light on utilizing such knowledge behind the books. In this paper, we discuss a new policy learning problem called Policy Learning from tutorial Books (PLfB) upon the shoulders of LLMs’ systems, which aims to leverage rich resources such as tutorial books to derive a policy network. Inspired by how humans learn from books, we solve the problem via a three-stage framework: Understanding, Rehearsing, and Introspecting (URI). In particular, it first rehearses decision-making trajectories based on the derived knowledge after understanding the books, then introspects in the imaginary dataset to distill a policy network.  We build two benchmarks for PLfB~based on Tic-Tac-Toe and Football games. In experiment, URI's policy achieves at least 44% net win rate against GPT-based agents without any real data; In Football game, which is a complex scenario, URI's policy beat the built-in AIs with a 37% while using GPT-based agent can only achieve a 6\% winning rate.

As URI’s implementation involves interactions among several components from different research domains,  it indeed might look complex, especially for readers who are not familiar with one of these domains.  In response to this question, we plan to add a pseudo code to the revised paper (see Algorithm 3 in the attached PDF) to make the interactions unambiguous. Besides, we commit to open-source our full-procedure code to help users understand the details of this project. We kindly recommend the reviewer check our open-source plan in the global response.  We hope these efforts will make this study more easy to follow.\n\n**Q2: A class of methods that use LLMs as the backbone is missing.**\n\nThanks for the valuable suggestion. RT is a classic baseline missing before. We implement an RT-style policy for football based on LLAMA and report the results in Table 2 and Figure 1 in the attached PDF. We use the same 7,500 initial states as URI and the rule-based actions to train the RT policy. After training, the loss can be reduced to normal as shown in Figure 1. However, though we tried our best to improve the performance, RT-policy turned out to fail in reaching the goal (See Table 2). We assume it is due to the size of training data is too small to be used for generalizable policy imitation. We will keep on trying but we cannot guarantee that we can get a better result. \n\nIn response to this suggestion, we plan to (1) add RT-branch studies to the related work and (2) add the best performance we can reach to the revised paper.\n\n**Q3: It would have been helpful to see how well URI does in a head-to-head match with the baselines.**\n\nWe agree that the head-to-head evaluation is valuable and will make the effectiveness of URI more convincing. Due to the limitation of the current simulator implementation, it will require considerable engineering work to modify the current Football environment to support the simultaneous evaluation of two policies. We are trying our best to finish such a job and commit to reporting the results in the revised version. \n\nOn the other hand, the extended experiment in Tic-Tac-Toe does include head-to-head evaluations in the attached PDF. The results show that URI significantly outperforms the two major baselines LLM-as-agent and LLM-RAG with **+66%** and **+44%** net win rate. We hope this result can also solve the reviewer\'s concern.\n\n**Q4: How does this method relate to the use of background textual knowledge in ""Motif: Intrinsic Motivation from Artificial Intelligence Feedback"" and ""Learning to Model the World With Language""?**\n\nThanks the reviewer for pointing out these two related works. We will add a brief introduction and comparison with them in the related work section.  Specifically,\n\n1. Motif: Intrinsic Motivation from Artificial Intelligence Feedback: the language is used as a caption of the observation. LLM is used as a surrogate reward model to output an evaluation (preference) of the observation (state) based on its caption. Such a preference model is then used to distill a reward model. Given this reward model, the policy is still trained in an online fashion. This could be classified into the LLM as a reward model category in our related work.\n2. Learning to Model the World With Language: the observation contains both image and language. LLM is used as a part of the world model to predict future observations. The training paradigm is still the traditional Model-based RL, but the model here is multi-modal. This could be classified into the ""LLM as dynamics model category"" in our related work. \n\n**Q5: How beneficial is learning with an LLM versus learning a policy with the task reward and no LLM?**\n\n Since the PLfB is more like in a offlineRL setting, we tested the performance of CQL as the result of policy learning with the task reward and no LLM. The results are in Table 2 in the attached PDF. In summary, CQL also achieved a competitive performance compared with other baselines, i.e., LLM-as-agent and LLM-RAG, but still significantly underperforms URI (0.07 vs 0.38 in average GDM). This result demonstrates the benefits of URI in improving the policy\'s performance compared with standard policy learning methods. \n\n**Q6: The limitations are not discussed in the main body of the paper.**\n\nWe would like to kindly point out that the limitation of this paper is mentioned in Section 7.

In response to the concern, we would like to use a high-quality open-source code to keep this study easy to follow and reproduce. We kindly recommend the review to check  our open-source plan in the second section of the global response letter.\n\n**Q4: Quality of Textual Resources**\n\n*Q4.1: How do you plan to address potential limitations*\n\nThe effectiveness of the policy derived by the URI framework fundamentally hinges on the quality of the textual data. It is indeed important that the textual resources should cover sufficiently the dynamics, policy, and rewards of the targeted environment so that relevant knowledge and imaginary data can be extracted to train the policy, otherwise it is impossible to derive a good enough policy.  There are several potential approaches to address this limitation:\n\n1. **Multimodal Data Integration**: Beyond purely textual data, additional modalities such as tutorial voices, demonstration videos, and replays can be incorporated. By employing advanced multimodal large language models, these diverse forms of data can be processed in a manner akin to the current handling within the URI, thereby augmenting the knowledge base and enhancing the robustness of policy learning.\n2. **Utilization of Real Interaction Data**: During the introspection phase, incorporating real interaction data with the target environment, rather than relying solely on simulated data generated by large language models, can enhance policy learning. This mixed-data approach can be used to further fine-tune various modules within the URI framework, potentially boosting overall performance. However, one might develop new techniques to utilize both sources of data for better policy learning.\n3. **Injection of Prior Knowledge**: The URI framework allows for the integration of human expert knowledge at different stages of the pipeline. Experts can provide specific code knowledge representations/formulations/templates when generate code-based knowledge.  We can also provide constraints during the rehearsal process to enhance stability and realism.\n\n*Q4.2: Criteria for Selecting and Evaluating Resources*\n\nEvaluating the quality of training data remains a challenging issue across machine learning community. There are possible methods [1-3] that might guide our evaluation. These studies suggest frameworks and empirical strategies that can be adapted to evaluate the relevance and quality of textual and multimodal data for training purposes. However, given the significant modality gap between textual data and the neural network parameters in PLfB topics—and the largely unsupervised nature of our learning process—this is not a trivial problem. This complexity requires innovative approaches for assessment. \n\n[1] QuRating: Selecting High-Quality Data for Training Language Models\n\n[2] An Empirical Exploration in Quality Filtering of Text Data\n\n[3] DoGE: Domain Reweighting with Generalization Estimation\n\nWe believe these discussions are valuable for the research community. In response to this question, we commit to include them in Appendix F of the revised paper. Additionally, we would like to highlight that many real-world decision-making scenarios have an abundance of textual tutorial resources, such as medical diagnosis, financial trading, software development, and educational tutoring. Thus, even in domains with rich textual resources, the topic remains broad and highly valuable.""}}, 'id': 'XJ9Hctd1FM', 'forum': 'Ddak3nSqQM', 'replyto': 'ZTrEuJXWtl', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7398/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7398/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7398/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723001472978, 'cdate': 1723001472978, 'tmdate': 1730881761961, 'mdate': 1730881761961, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""**Q1: If there are more domains where the authors could experiment with different data sources, the readers would have better expectation of the model.**\n\nWe agree that applying URI to more domains would strengthen readers' understanding, expectation, and belief in it.

We need real-world practices to bridge the knowledge-utilizing gaps in books. However, it is non-trivial to design a practical method to fully utilize the **online data to improve the URI pipeline.** We have made a brief discussion about such an extension as a future research direction in Appendix F.

We appreciate all the recognition and kind comments on our work, including **conceptual novelty and enlightenment** (R1, R2, R3, R4); **realistic, extensive, and well-motivated experiments** (R1, R2, R3, R4); **promising results** (R1, R2, R3);  **intuitive motivation** behind the method design (R1,R2,R3). Beyond the work itself, reviewers also recognize that ideas in our work could be further utilized under a **broader context** including synthetic data generation and learning from richer resources (R1, R3).\n\nIn the following, we report our responses to the common concerns and suggestions proposed by the reviewers.\n\n### **1 Generalizability of the URI methodology to other domains**\n\nWe acknowledge applying URI in just single domains might raise concerns about the generalizability of the methodology. In response to this concern, we build a new proof-of-concept benchmark based on the classic Tie Tac Toe game (TTT). In particular, we use a minimax policy, which is the optimal policy in this game, to collect all possible trajectories in this game. Then, for each trajectory, we use GPT to derive textual books by summarizing the trajectories, and analyzing the game mechanics, winning conditions, and strategic principles we can learn from the trajectory. Since we have all optimal trajectories, the process guarantees the textual book is high-quality to cover complete knowledge in this game (ignore the information loss of GPT generations) so it is an ideal testbed for PLfB.\n\nWe then apply URI in the TTT textual book. *Note that we use the same prompt template and just modify the task-specific contents. Our results can then be achieved by tuning the weight of transition, reward penalty, and conservative loss in CIQL, which are 0.05, 0.05, and 0.1 respectively*. The results are in Table 1, and Figure 2 in the attached PDF file. Our key findings are as follows:\n\n1. As shown in Table 1, URI demonstrates superior performance across all opponents in head-to-head matches, where it achieves the highest net win rate (win - loss) of **+66%, +44%, +52%** against LLM-as-agent, LLM-RAG, and Random Policy, respectively.\n2. Besides, against Minimax-noise, URI **still maintains a positive win-loss percentage**, indicating competitive ability even when facing a near-to-optimal strategy, while all baselines can only get negative net win rates.\n3. We also apply several important experiments to show the effectiveness of URI components in the main body to the TTT environment. In particular, knowledge segment aggregation (Figure 4 in the main body) is in Figure 2 and visualization of the projected distributions for real and imaginary datasets (Figure 7 in the main body) is in Figure 3. The results are similar among these two environments, which further demonstrate the effectiveness of URI components. In particular, for knowledge segment aggregation, **the number of knowledge pieces will be reduced and converge after 4 iterations**; for visualization, **high-uncertainty regions can be identified** by the uncertainty predictor (marked with yellow ovals), while low-uncertainty regions (marked with blue ovals) are generated surrounded by the real data.

MCTS and  A$^*$ both perform heuristic search and are mutually beneficial. Efforts have been made to the renaissance of A$^*$ from three possible aspects, two of which have been confirmed by studies in recent years, while the third is about the OPEN list that consists of open nodes of A$^*$ search, but still lacks deep investigation. This paper aims at the third, i.e., developing the Sampling-exploration enhanced A$^*$ (SeeA$^*$) search by constructing a dynamic subset of OPEN through a selective sampling process, such that the node with the best heuristic value in this subset instead of in the OPEN is expanded. Nodes with the best heuristic values in OPEN are most probably picked into this subset, but sometimes may not be included, which enables SeeA$^*$ to explore other promising branches. Three sampling techniques are presented for comparative investigations. Moreover, under the assumption about the distribution of prediction errors, we have theoretically shown the superior efficiency of SeeA$^*$ over A$^*$ search, particularly when the accuracy of the guiding heuristic function is insufficient. Experimental results on retrosynthetic planning in organic chemistry, logic synthesis in integrated circuit design, and the classical Sokoban game empirically demonstrate the efficiency of SeeA$^*$, in comparison with the state-of-the-art heuristic search algorithms.",Oral Session 2C: Reinforcement Learning,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=mSaqxZVZW8,https://openreview.net/forum?id=mSaqxZVZW8,mSaqxZVZW8,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'The work builds on  two search algorithms, MCTS an A*, to introduce  a new algorithm, SeeA*, which ehnances A* with a flexible exploration-exploitation balance.

In Theorem 4.3, $p_{\\sigma}$ is the probability that $f$ of an optimal node $n$ exceeds $f$ of a non-optimal node $n\'$, \n$p_{\\sigma}=P(f(n)\\leq f(n\')|\\sigma)$. $P_S(\\sigma)>P_A(\\sigma)$ holds if and only if \n$$\np_{\\sigma}<H(N_o,K),\\quad\\quad\\quad H(N_o,K)=\\left(\\frac{K}{N_o}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{N_o-K}}.\n$$\n$p_{\\sigma}$ decreases as the prediction error $\\sigma$ increases. If $\\sigma$ is quite small, then $p_{\\sigma}$ approaches $1$, and the inequality in Theorem 4.3 is unlikely to hold. In this case, A* can identify the optimal solution efficiently without the need for candidate sampling in SeeA*. If $\\sigma$ is large, estimated $f$ values are misleading, and the probability that the optimal node\'s $f$ value is the best among open nodes is low, possiblely even lower than random sampling. In this case, $p_{\\sigma}$ is small, and the inequality holds. SeeA* is more effective than A* when $f$ is inaccurate. \n\nAs the branching factors increase and the solution paths grow longer, the size of open set $N_o$ grows. $H(N_o,K)$ monotonically increases with respect to $N_o$. As $N_o$ approaches infinity, $H(N_o,K)$ tends to $1$, and the inequality holds. Intuitively, $n$ is expanded if its $f$ value is the smallest among open nodes. Inaccurate predictions raise the likelihood of other nodes having smaller $f$ values. As $N_o$ increases, $f(n)$ is less likely to be the smallest, leading to poorer performance of A*. SeeA* reduces the number of available nodes for selection, resulting in better performance compared to A*.\n\nThe number of candidate nodes $K$ is a key hyperparameter balancing exploration and exploitation. In SeeA*, exploitation selects the node with the best $f$ value, like A* search, while exploration uses a sampling strategy to create diverse candidate sets. If $K=1$, the selected node is determined by the sampling strategy, and SeeA* becomes random sampling. If $K\\rightarrow\\infty$, the candidate set is the same as the open set, and SeeA* degenerates into best-first A*. A smaller $K$ enhances exploration of SeeA*. $H(N_o,K)$ increases with $K$. If $K$ is very small, the value of $H$ will be relatively small. To ensure the inequality holds, an appropriate value of $K$ should be chosen. What\'s more, the probability of SeeA* expanding the optimal node as defined in Equation 8 reaches its maximum value when $K=-1/\\log p_{\\sigma}$, which increases with $p_{\\sigma}$. For small $p_{\\sigma}$, the optimal $K$ is the smallest value 1. When $p_{\\sigma}$ approaches 1, the optimal $K$ will be the largest $\\infty$. The choice of $K$ value is related to the prediction error $\\sigma$ of the heuristic function.'}}, 'id': '3ktMq95GSH', 'forum': 'mSaqxZVZW8', 'replyto': 'mSaqxZVZW8', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1325/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1325/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1325/-/Author_Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723030003807, 'cdate': 1723030003807, 'tmdate': 1730888326043, 'mdate': 1730888326043, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': 'Q9: The experimental setup for DeepCubeA is not clearly stated,.\n\nA9: The experimental setup DeepCubeA is the same as the original paper [5].

When $K \\to \\infty$, all open nodes are selected as the candidate nodes, and SeeA* degenerates back to A*. The expanded node is chosen using a best-first approach, relying entirely on the exploitation of the $f$ function. When $K \\to 1$, only one node is selected as the candidate node, and hence, it is guaranteed to be expanded. The expanded node is determined by the exploration of the sampling strategy. Therefore, an appropriate value of $K$ ensures that SeeA* is a combination of A* search and random search, achieving a balance between exploitation and exploration.\n\nQ14: Equation 8: We can get an optimal ($K = -1/\\log p$). For large prediction error, ($K \\to 1$), random selection. For small prediction error, ($K \\to \\infty$), A*.\n\nA14: We agree with your viewpoint. Equation 8 reaches its maximum value when $K=-1/\\log p$, at which point SeeA performs optimally. For large prediction errors, $p$ approaches $0$, and SeeA* degrades to random selection by setting $K=1$. For small prediction errors, $p$ approaches $1$, and SeeA* is the same as A* by setting $K=\\infty$. Intuitively, if the prediction error is sufficiently small, then the best-first A* search is optimal. If the prediction error is significantly large, decisions based on $f$ values are likely to be misleading, and random sampling may perform better in this case.

We will revise our paper carefully. Hope our explanation below can address your concerns.\n\nQ1: Adding a maximum iteration limit to guarantee termination.\n\nA1: Adding a limit to guarantee termination is necessary, and is adopted in our experiments. In retrosynthesis planning, search algorithms are limited to a maximum of $500$ policy calls, or $10$ minutes of running time, as mentioned in Line 271. In Sokoban, the search process is terminated if the running time exceeds $10$ minutes. We will revise Alg 1 accordingly.\n\nQ2: The potential drawbacks of uniform sampling strategy.\n\nA2: The uniform sampling strategy is easy to implement, but $P(n_1\\in\\mathcal{D})$, the probability of selecting the optimal node $n_1$ to the candidate set $\\mathcal{D}$, is relatively low, which directly impacts $P_S$, as shown in Equation 7. Therefore, additional strategies, clustering sampling and UCT-like sampling, are designed to improve $P(n_1\\in\\mathcal{D})$ by increasing the diversity of the selected nodes to avoid the excessive concentration of a few branches, thereby increasing $P(n_1\\in\\mathcal{D})$. If more information is available besides the $f$ evaluation, superior strategies can be designed, such as a specialized policy model. \n\nQ3: The assumption in Corollary 4.2 is quite strong. Prediction error is more likely non-uniform like Gaussians.\n\nA3: Thank you for your suggestion. We can prove that Corollary 4.2 also holds when noise follows a Gaussian distribution. Please refer to Global Rebuttal A1.\n\nQ4: Are f and f* values generalize broadly (or) are they cherry picked?\n\nA4: A specific example is provided in Figure 1 to illustrate that A* may be trapped in a local optimum due to insufficient exploration, which is not uncommon due to the prediction errors of guiding heuristics. Figure 7 & 9 in the appendix displayed the search tree of A* and SeeA* while solving a logic synthesis problem. A* exhibits an excessive concentration of expanded nodes in a particular non-optimal branch, which is the same as Figure 1. The superior performance of SeeA* over A* also corroborate this assertion.\n\nQ5: More intuition on the implications of Theorem 4.3.\n\nA5: Thanks for your suggestion. More detailed discussions will be added to the paper. Please refer to Global Rebuttal A2.\n\nQ6: It would be informative to compare SeeA* with an MCTS using the same guiding heuristics for a fair comparison.\n\nA6: In Table 2, the results of MCTS guided by the same heuristics as SeeA* are displayed in the PV-MCTS row, which achieves a 19.5% ADP reduction, surpassing MCTS\'s 18.5% but falling short of SeeA*\'s 23.5%. We will further clarify the distinction between the two in the revised paper.\n\nQ7: The hyperparameter analysis is limited to the retrosynthetic planning problem. Does this generalize to other two problem domains and beyond?\n\nA7: Ablation studies on the Sokoban have been provided in the appendix. As presented in Figure 11, the performance of SeeA* is stable across a wide range of $K$. As shown in Table 8, the stronger the exploration, the shorter the identified solution path length, and the greater the number of expansions required to find a feasible solution. Due to the relatively low difficulty levels of the testing examples in the Sokoban, constructing an accurate value predictor is easier than with the other applications. Therefore, SeeA* is only slightly better than A*.\n\nAblation studies on logic synthesis are summarized below. The performance for different candidate set sizes $K$ for SeeA* with uniform sampling is displayed. The performance is robust against different $K$, outperforming A* ($K=\\infty$) consistently.\n\n|K|1|3|5|10|20|30|50|$\\infty$|\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|ADP reduction (%)|19.8|22.1|21.6|19.8|21.2|19.7|19.8|19.5|\n\nThe performance for different $c_b$ for UCT-like sampling is as follows, which is robust against different $c_b$. enhanced exploration with a larger $c_b$ leads to superior performance and longer running time. \n\n|$c_b$|0.5|1.0|1.38|1.5|\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n|ADP reduction (%)|20.8|21.8|22.5|22.6|\n\nQ8: Paper only tests on problems that don’t have inaccurate heuristics. Testing on additional domains that have unreliable heuristics would be a good addition.\n\nA8: Thank you for your suggestion. In the paper, two applications where obtaining accurate heuristics is challenging are considered. To illustrate the effectiveness of SeeA* on problems where accurate heuristics could exist but the guiding heuristic used is unreliable, experiments on pathfinding are conducted, which is to find the shortest path from a starting point to a destination. The cost for each step is 1. $g$ is the number of steps taken to reach the current position, and $h$ is the Euclidean distance from the current position to the target position, which is reliable to guide the A* search. $100$ robotic motion planning problems [4] are used to test the performance of A* and SeeA*. Under the guidance of the same reliable $h$, both A* and SeeA* find the optimal solutions for all testing cases, for which the average length is $400$. The number of expansions of SeeA*($K=5$) with uniform sampling is $33283.21$, slightly less than the $33340.52$ of A*. To validate the superiority of SeeA*, an unreliable heuristic function $\\hat{h}$ is employed, which is randomly sampled from $[0, 2\\times h]$. During the search process, nodes are evaluated by $\\hat{f}=g+\\hat{h}$. In this situation, the average solution length of A* is $691.1$, much longer than SeeA*\'s $438.4$. Moreover, A* requires $50281.28$ expansions, which is significantly more than the $32847.26$ expansions needed by SeeA*. Therefore, guided by an unreliable heuristic, SeeA* finds a better solution than A* with fewer expansions, demonstrating the superiority of SeeA*.\n\n[4] Bhardwaj, Mohak, Sanjiban Choudhury, and Sebastian Scherer.

We will revise the paper accordingly and define symbols clearly. The key algorithms will be moved to the main paper. We hope that our response addresses your concerns.\n\nQ1: Why Figure 1 lists (n) with ($10^4$).\n\nA1: Setting the number of nodes to $10^4$ in the non-optimal branch is intended to demonstrate that even if the path is quite poor ($f=10^4<<f^*$), A* still spends significant efforts expanding nodes along that branch. \n\nQ2: Is ($f^*$) sampled from Gaussian and ($f^*$) also sampled from Uniform?\n\nA2: In our assumptions, the $f^*$ value is the ground truth evaluation, and $f$ aims to accurately predict $f^*$. The prediction error of $f$ with respect to $f^*$ follows a uniform distribution. The distribution of $f^*$ values for all non-optimal nodes is Gaussian. We will revise the original description to clarify the expression.\n\nQ3: Why is uniform slower than cluster as Uniform has smaller expansions, and cluster needs additional cluster process time?\n\nA3: There are primarily three parts. The first part is that competitive learning reduces the time required for clustering. One simply needs to assign each new node to the nearest center without an iterative process or re-clustering. The second part is that the time required for expanding each node varies. In retrosynthesis planning, expanding a node needs to utilize the RDKit package to reconstruct potential chemical reactions from the top $50$ chemical reaction templates selected based on the policy network. The number of chemical reactions corresponding to each reaction template varies, resulting in differences in computation time. The third part is the penalty for unresolved testing samples. If a test sample fails to identify a feasible solution, the expansion count for that sample is set to $500$, and the runtime is $600$ seconds, when calculating the mean performance listed in the table. The penalty for runtime is more severe than for expansion times. Due to the higher success rate of the Cluster sampling compared to the Uniform sampling, the discrepancy between running time and the number of expansions is possible.\n\nQ4: Experiment on path search since this method is highly related to A*.\n\nA4: Experiments on pathfinding problems are conducted using an existing heuristic function $h$ for guidance. The pathfinding problem is to find the shortest collision-free path from a starting point to a destination. The cost for each step is $1$. $g$ is the number of steps taken to reach the current position, and heuristic $h$ is the Euclidean distance from the current position to the target position, which is reliable to guide the A* search. The $100$ robotic motion planning problems [1] are used to test the performance. Under the guidance of the same reliable $h$, both A* and SeeA* find the optimal solution for all testing cases, and the average length is $400$. The number of expansions of SeeA*($K=5$) with uniform sampling is $33283.21$, slightly less than the $33340.52$ of A*. To validate the superiority of SeeA*, an unreliable heuristic function $\\hat{h}$ is employed, which is randomly sampled from $[0, 2\\times h]$. During the search process of A*, the node with the smallest $\\hat{f}=g+\\hat{h}$ is expanded. In this situation, the average solution length of A* is $691.1$, much longer than SeeA*\'s $438.4$. Moreover, A* requires $50281.28$ expansions, which is significantly more than the $32847.26$ expansions needed by SeeA*. Therefore, guided by an unreliable heuristic function, SeeA* finds a better solution than A* with fewer expansions, demonstrating the superiority of SeeA*.\n\n[1] Bhardwaj, Mohak, Sanjiban Choudhury, and Sebastian Scherer. ""Learning heuristic search via imitation."" Conference on Robot Learning 2017.\n\nQ5: This paper is about a traditional search algorithm and the learning part is not very clear.\n\nA5: We believe that our paper is suitable for NeurIPS. MCTS with help of deep learning contributed crucially the success of AlphaZero. Deep learning is also able to contribute renaissance of A*, and three possible aspects are addressed with a family of possible improvements [2]. The first and also straightforward aspect is estimating $f$ with help of deep learning, which makes current studies on A* including this paper into the era of learning aided A*. The second aspect is seeking better estimation of $f$, such as scouting before expanding the current node to collect future information to revise $f$ of the current node, which takes a crucial rule for the success of AlphaGo. The third aspect is about selecting nodes among the OPEN list that consists of open nodes of A*. It is an old tune even in the classical era of A*, but investigation is seldomly made. As shown in Appendix D, J, and L, fully connected network, convolutional network, and graph network are utilized to estimate the $h$ function.\n\nMoreover, the part of sampling strategies is related to learning distributions of open nodes. Uniform sampling approximates the distribution based on frequencies. Clustering sampling is akin to use Gaussian mixture model to learn the distribution of open nodes, where each cluster is a Gaussian. Competitive learning is adopted to assigns nodes to save computing resources.

We hope that our response addresses any concerns you may have.\n\nQ1:Is the clustering strategy susceptible to collapsing to a single cluster? \n\nA1: This scenario may indeed occur, and in such situations, running multiple iterations with varied initializations can be considered. Developing more efficient sampling strategies is a crucial future endeavor. In practical applications outlined in the paper, this scenario occurs infrequently in general. It occurs more often when the number of clusters is relatively low, but it may be justifiable to obtain only one cluster in some cases with fewer nodes in the search tree. For example, when the number of clusters is initialized at $5$, in the retrosynthesis task, all the generated nodes of $74$ (out of $190$) testing samples are assigned to the same one cluster after the search is terminated. The average number of node expansions to identify a feasible solution is $79.75$. When we look into the details of the $74$ samples, $53$ ones have found a feasible solution within less than $20$ expansions, and $72$ samples have found a feasible solution within less than $79.75$ expansions. What's more, increasing the number of initial cluster centers and then selecting only clusters containing nodes evenly can be a potential solution to avoid the clustering strategy collapsing to a single cluster. For the above mentioned retrosynthesis task, when the number of initial cluster centers is $20$, the number of samples with only one cluster decreases from $74$ to $41$. \n\nQ2: How is the heuristic function for Sokoban trained?\n\nA2: Training details will be added to the appendix. The DeepCubeA paper provides $50,000$ training Sokoban problems and $1,000$ testing Sokoban problems. The A* search guided by a manually designed heuristic is employed to find solutions for the training problems. $g$ is the number of steps arriving at the current state. $h$ is the sum of distances between the boxes and their destinations, along with the distance between the player and the nearest box. Under limited search time, $46,252$ training problems are solved. For each collected trajectory  $\\{n_0^i,n_1^i,\\cdots,n_t^i,\\cdots,n_{T_i}^i\\}$, the learning target for state $n_t^i$ is the number of steps from $n_t^i$ to the goal state $n_{T_i}$:\n$$z(n_t^i)=T_i-t.$$\nMean square error is employed as the loss function:\n$$L(\\theta)=\\frac{\\sum_{i}\\sum_{t}(v(n_t^i;\\theta)-z(n_t^i))^2}{\\sum_i T_i}$$\nAdam optimizer with a $0.0001$ learning rate is used to update the parameters.\n\nQ3: It seems the uniform sampling method performs better than A* search. Is there any intuition as to why? For environments with large branching factors, where deep search trees are needed, and where shortest paths are sparse, the probability of sampling a subset of OPEN that contains nodes on a shortest path would be small. Would this not hurt performance for uniform?\n\nA3: SeeA* uniformly samples candidate nodes and expands the one with the lowest $f$ value. In this setting, each nodes, except a few with the worst $f$ values, has a probability of being expanded, and the node with a smaller $f$ value still has a larger expansion likelihood, as discussed in Appendix O. SeeA* improves exploration compared to A*, but expansion remains mainly concentrated on nodes with the best $f$ values. Therefore, SeeA* achieves a balance between exploration and exploitation, making it better than A*.\n\nIf the optimal node $n_1$ is expanded by A*, $f(n_1)$ must be less than the $f$ values of all $N_o$ open nodes, while SeeA* only needs to select $n_1$ from $K$ candidate nodes if $n_1$ is included in the candidate set $\\mathcal{D}$. \n$$P_{A^*}(n_1 \\text{ is expanded})=P(n_1=\\arg\\min_{n\\in\\mathcal{O}}f(n))$$\n$$P_{SeeA^*}(n_1 \\text{ is expanded})=P(n_1=\\arg\\min_{n\\in\\mathcal{D}}f(n)|n_1\\in\\mathcal{D})P(n_1\\in\\mathcal{D})$$\nSeeA* outperforms A* if\n$$P(n_1\\in\\mathcal{D})>P(n_1=\\arg\\min_{n\\in\\mathcal{O}}f(n)) / P(n_1=\\arg\\min_{n\\in\\mathcal{D}}f(n))=p_{\\sigma}^{N_o-1}/p_{\\sigma}^{K-1}=p_{\\sigma}^{N-k}.$$\n\nAccording to Corollary 4.2, the larger the prediction error $\\sigma$, the lower the likelihood $p_{\\sigma}$ that the $f(n_1)$ is smaller than the $f$ value of a non-optimal node. $P_O=P(n_1=\\arg\\min_{n\\in\\mathcal{O}}f(n))$ is the product of $N_o-1$ probabilities, while $P_D=P(n_1=\\arg\\min_{n\\in\\mathcal{D}}f(n))$ is the product of $K-1$ probabilities. When $\\sigma$ increases, $P_O$ decreases much faster than $P_D$. The right side of the above inequality decreases. For uniform sampling, $P(n_1\\in\\mathcal{D})=K/N_o$ is irrelevant with $\\sigma$. Therefore, even with uniform sampling, SeeA* can outperform A* when $\\sigma$ are large enough.\n\nIn scenarios with large branching factors, the probability of sampling a candidate set containing optimal nodes is lower. Taking uniform sampling as an example, $P(n_1\\in\\mathcal{D})=K/N_o$ decreases as $N_o$ increases. However, the probability of A* selecting the optimal node will also decrease significantly with $N_o$ because every node has a probability of better than $n_1$. As presented in Equation 10, $H(N_o)$ approaches $1$ as $N_o$ approaches infinity, ensuring the inequality in Theorem 4.3 holds. Despite the potential decline in SeeA*'s performance with the growth of $N_o$ inevitably, it continues to outperform A*.\n\nQ4: I wonder what the results would be in an environment Line 123: Step 3 also occurs if a node is associated with a state in CLOSED, but is find via a shorter path.\n\nA4: If a node is associated with a state in CLOSED but is found via a shorter path, this node is expanded as Line 123. Experiments are conducted in retrosynthesis planning. The performance is similar to the results in the paper, and SeeA* still outperforms A* with higher success rates and shorter solution lengths.\n\n|Algorithm|Solved|Length|Expansions| \n|-|-|-|-|\n|A*|88.42%|9.28|91.27|\n|SeeA*(Uniform)|96.32%|7.44|69.21|\n|SeeA*(Cluster)|96.84%|7.04| 64.84|\n|SeeA*(UCT)|98.95%|6.36|56.87|""}}, 'id': 'Oziqs8pmyM', 'forum': 'mSaqxZVZW8', 'replyto': 'K5eve2ybcb', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1325/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1325/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1325/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723029039883, 'cdate': 1723029039883, 'tmdate': 1730880535846, 'mdate': 1730880535846, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'This work introduces a refined version of the A* search algorithm that integrates selective sampling to improve exploration & efficiency.

By comparing models’ survey responses to those of different human reference populations, researchers aim to infer the demographics, political opinions, or values best represented by current language models. In this work, we critically examine language models' survey responses on the basis of the well-established American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau. Evaluating 43 different language models using de-facto standard prompting methodologies, we establish two dominant patterns. First, models' responses are governed by ordering and labeling biases, for example, towards survey responses labeled with the letter “A”. Second, when adjusting for these systematic biases through randomized answer ordering, models across the board trend towards uniformly random survey responses, irrespective of model size or training data. As a result, models consistently appear to better represent subgroups whose aggregate statistics are closest to uniform for the survey under consideration, leading to potentially misguided conclusions about model alignment.",Oral Session 3B: Natural Language Processing,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Oo7dlLgqQX,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Oo7dlLgqQX,Oo7dlLgqQX,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""This paper conducted large scale experiments to understand LLM's answer to survey questions that's designed for human.

I have adjusted my rating accordingly. \n\nMy initial assumption, related to the stratified sampling comment, was that surveys through LLMs were conducted conditionally on demographics. For example, the paper released today by Ashokkumar et al. (2024) requires LLMs to respond to survey questions conditional on random demographic characteristics. This is a more valid approach to conducting surveys through LLMs, and I agree with your paper that there are better approaches than unconditional sampling (or evaluating token probabilities). Similar to the remark of Reviewer gFgE, the conditioning on demographics gave me a conflict with the US Census data set, as many questions related to the demographic information would then be embedded in the prompt. However, as you point out, you also run experiments on survey opinions. \n\nIt might be worthwhile to point out that conditioning LLMs on demographics via prompts may be part of the solution. However, you implicitly already do this with the sequential prompting strategy, keeping previous demographic information in context.

Prior work has hypothesised that models may trend towards certain demographics; for example, younger demographics, which tend to be more present on the internet. Another candidate could be models trending towards the responses of particularly populous U.S. states, simply because they may produce larger volumes of data. However, we observe that base models\' ACS responses are *qualitatively* different from those of human populations. Because of these qualitative differences, we argue that the quantitative analysis of prior work may be misleading (Section 5). This is not to say that base models do not have biases, or do not represent certain populations better than others. Rather, our findings signal the need to move beyond multiple-choice prompting towards a more holistic evaluation of LLMs (e.g., open ended survey responses) to elicit more faithful representations of the population a language model might represent.\n\n**Impersonation** We focus on evaluating whether the survey responses of LLMs are representative of certain U.S. demographic subgroups. In this setting, it is standard to prompt the model without any added context. Assessing whether models have the ability of producing answers relevant to specific sub-groups if instructed to do so is beyond the scope of our work. \n\n**Do humans have A bias?** There is evidence for ordering bias in humans in the context of opinion surveys, and a tendency not to pick extreme values. However, in the context of the ACS demographic survey, it is well-understood that ordering effects play a very minor role in the distribution of responses collected by the U.S. census. The recent work of Tjuatja et al., 2023 finds that the response biases of language models (e.g., A-bias) are generally not human-like.\n\nTjuatja, Lindia, et al.

However, these models have undergone both standard supervised fine-tuning (i.e., instruction tuning) as well as RLHF. Overall, we observe that the responses of fine-tuned models vary more across questions (e.g., are not as balanced as those of base models). We, however, find no evidence that the responses of RLHF models better represent those of human populations. This is not to say that RLHF introduces no steer, but rather that the multiple-choice survey methodology that has recently gained traction in the community may not be appropriate to study this phenomena.'}}, 'id': 'ryceghU5T8', 'forum': 'Oo7dlLgqQX', 'replyto': 'LpGR95BmTM', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16093/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16093/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16093/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723022100128, 'cdate': 1723022100128, 'tmdate': 1730883555882, 'mdate': 1730883555882, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thank you for the feedback. We hope to address your concerns and clarify some misunderstanding below.\n\n> their experiment adds little value to further support their claim on ""better represent subgroups whose aggregate statistics are closest to uniform.""\n\nWe believe this to be a misunderstanding. We do not claim that models better represent subgroups whose aggregate statistics are closest to uniform. Let us clarify.\n\nOur experiments show that, using the de-facto standard multiple-choice methodology, models strongly trend towards uniformly random responses (Figures 4 and 5). This results in a very strong correlation between subgroup entropy and alignment (Figure 6). Such correlation consistently holds across surveys, subgroups, and models. Therefore, models **appear to** better represent subgroups whose aggregate statistics are closest to uniform. \n\nOur experiments explain the findings of earlier work (i.e., Santurkar et al. 2023, see the discussion in Section 5, “Beyond the ACS”), and why these findings may be misleading. Models appear to better represent younger demographics not because of the pre-training data, but because younger demographics happen to have more uniform responses for the ACS. We are not claiming that language models actually better represent certain populations intrinsically. We are arguing that the de-facto standard methodology to survey language models has strong limitations, and it can potentially lead to misleading insights. Our claims are not about whether language models better represent certain populations, but rather about the limitations of the dominant survey methodology itself.\n\n>The 2019 ACS uses stratified sampling. Therefore, I believe that the variance is already being increased to obtain a representative sample. Since the additional context given to the LLM is very limited + the draws are independent, it seems like a very hard task to generate a matching distribution by the LLM.\n\nIf we understand correctly, your point is that the aggregate responses of the U.S. census (the reference population used in our work) appear to be more entropic than they actually are, due to the U.S. census not representing households uniformly at random. Our claim is that, when using the dominant multiple-choice methodology to survey models, model responses are *qualitatively* different from those of the U.S. census. Model responses strongly trend towards uniformly random, irrespective of the survey question being asked. The responses of the U.S. census do not – they are heterogeneous. If stratified sampling were to have a small effect on the U.S. census responses, it is still the case that model responses (e.g., the blue dots in Figure 4a) look nothing like those of the U.S. population (green dots).\n\nPlease note that there are no “draws” – for each survey question, we extract the models’ survey response analytically by extracting its next-token probabilities over each of the answer choices (e.g., “A”, “B”, …). This is the standard methodology introduced by Santurkar et al. for surveying language models using multiple-choice questionnaires. Our contribution is to shed light on the properties of these output distributions.\n\n> First-token probabilities may be a biassed measure to obtain the replies [...] more advanced prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022a), could improve the coherence and dependencies in the responses, especially for the sequential generation.\n\nWe agree with your points. They support the overall conclusion of our work that the current multiple-choice methodology used to survey language models has strong limitations, and we should move towards a more holistic evaluation of LLMs (e.g., open ended survey responses rather than multiple choice) in order to elicit more faithful representations of the population a language model might represent.\n\n> I believe that the sensitivity to ordering and labelling biases is known (Wei et al. (2022b) and Wei et al. (2023)).\n\nOrdering bias has been observed in various works. We cite Robinson and Wingate (2023a).  We are happy to include more references in the final version. Our work is different from prior work in studying the effects of ordering biases for models’ survey responses. We show that models’ survey responses can substantially change after adjusting for their ordering biases, leading to fundamentally different insights regarding the populations that models’ best represent.\n\nWe hope the additional explanations helped address your concern.

We will implement the suggested changes to improve the figures. Let us address your questions in the following.\n\n**Selection of questions.** We chose 25 representative questions to achieve diversity over topics (e.g., educational attainment, healthcare status, employment status, etc.), while keeping figures readable. In the rebuttal pdf we include additional results for all ACS survey questions for comparison. We provide the A-bias and response entropy of models with publicly available weights. They show identical trends.\n\n**The role of training data.** Regarding the pre-training data, we find that all base models exhibit similar response distributions, despite being trained on substantially different pre-training data. While we find little difference across base models, beyond the ordering effects identified in Appendix C for smaller language models, we do observe substantial differences between the response distributions of different fine-tuned models. This suggests that fine-tuning data can have a larger effect on models’ distributions. This is a positive result for future work seeking to fine-tune models to alter their survey responses (e.g., emulate those of certain populations).\n\n**Why do instruction-tuned models have higher variance in entropy?** We generally find that, compared to base models, instruction-tuned models tend to have higher confidence in their responses for at least some of the survey questions. This causes instruction-tuned models to have higher variance in their response entropy compared to base models, as any deviation from balanced responses is more amplified. Note that we used publicly available instruction-tuned models, we did not perform instruction tuning ourselves. For some models (e.g., the Llama models), these instruction-tuning datasets are not publicly available.\n\n**Effects of question-ordering** We follow the predominant methodology of asking questions independent of each other. Therefore, there are no question-ordering effects. If questions were to be asked in sequence, putting the answer to previous questions in context, then we would expect to observe substantial question-ordering effects. But this was not the focus of our work.\n\n**Skewed randomization** Yes, for models that exhibit choice ordering biases, skewed randomization would change the response distribution. This is because we would no longer uniformly average across each of the possible choice orderings, but perform some weighted average. However, uniform is the only principled approach here to adjust for it.'}}, 'id': 'IZSEyB9KLD', 'forum': 'Oo7dlLgqQX', 'replyto': '1mxAUFLdv1', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16093/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16093/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16093/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723022025891, 'cdate': 1723022025891, 'tmdate': 1730883556457, 'mdate': 1730883556457, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'This paper conducts experiments to verify the alignment between human and LLM responses to the ACS survey.

This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes GPT-style AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.73, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 350.2, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verified that VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solid evidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest VAR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws and zero-shot task generalization. We have released all models and codes to promote the exploration of AR/VAR models for visual generation and unified learning.",Oral Session 2D: Generative Models,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gojL67CfS8,https://openreview.net/forum?id=gojL67CfS8,gojL67CfS8,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': ""Autoregression and Bayes' rule""}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thanks for the nice paper. Your statements on page 4 concerning a ""unidirectional dependency assumption"" in autoregressive models are incorrect. Fixed order autoregressive models assume some order in which to decompose a joint distribution into a sequence of simpler conditional distributions following Bayes\' rule. If we assume the correctness of Bayes\' rule, which seems reasonable, then the product of the simpler conditionals is precisely equivalent to the full joint distribution. Ie, autoregression does not require any particular dependency structure among the variables in the joint distribution for correctness.\n\nI suspect that you\'re slightly misstating the intuition that some sequential decompositions might be easier to learn or otherwise work with than others. Eg, in systems with strong ""causal"" structure it might make sense to predict effects conditioned on causes rather than predicting causes conditioned on effects. There are scenarios in which this intuition is definitely correct, ie, choosing the ""correct"" ordering for the autoregression offers formal benefits over the ""wrong"" ordering.

Unlike VQGAN or other AR image generators, where the number of steps is usually fixed, the inference steps in VAR (also the scale shapes in its VQVAE) can be slightly adjusted, e.g., replacing (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,13,16) with (1,2,4,6,8,10,13,16) or (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,14,16). This is possible because VAR treats a scale, rather than a single token, as an autoregressive unit, and operations based on the unit (interpolations) can generalize to different spatial resolutions. In other words, the reason is that we chose the scales in the visual signal for autoregressive generation, which is also mentioned as the **Strengths1** and **Strengths2** in the review comment.\n\nAnother natural question is how diffusion transformers will perform when the number of steps is small enough to approach VAR's 10 steps. We investigated this by using some ODE solvers like DDIM and DPM-Solver to reduce the diffusion inference steps. The results are as below.\n\n| Model                  | #Para | #Step | Time  | FID$\\downarrow$ |\n|------------------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|\n| VAR-$d24$              | 1.0B  | 10    | **0.6**   | **2.09**   |\n| DiT-XL/2 (original)    | 675M  | 250   | 45    | 2.27   |\n| DiT-XL/2 + DDIM        | 675M  | 250   | 45    | 2.14   |\n| DiT-XL/2 + DDIM        | 675M  | 20    | 2.9   | 4.68   |\n| DiT-XL/2 + DDIM        | 675M  | 10    | 1.8   | 12.38  |\n| U-ViT-H/2 + DPM-solver | 501M  | 20    | 15.6  | 2.53   |\n| U-ViT-H/2 + DPM-solver | 501M  | 10    | 7.8   | 3.18   |\n\nIt can be seen that while diffusion can be accelerated many times by the ODE solver, the sacrifice of FID becomes non-trivial when the number of steps reach 10.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen considered more broadly, we feel there's a **common limitation** of all Diffusion, AR, and VAR models: it is not possible to **automatically** determine the number of steps based on the input. For example, generating a blank blackboard clearly requires a different number of steps than a blackboard filled with math formulas. AR/VAR are expected to solve this with some modifications, like introducing an [EOS] token to allow the model itself to predict when to stop. We believe this is a valuable direction to be explored and will add it into our Limitation or Future Work section.""}}, 'id': 'eFjMWOpn5i', 'forum': 'gojL67CfS8', 'replyto': 'Hoc8nXAjhw', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19076/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19076/Authors'], 'number': 17, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19076/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723387837253, 'cdate': 1723387837253, 'tmdate': 1730889914263, 'mdate': 1730889914263, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': 'Thanks for your detailed reply.\n\nI have one additional question: diffusion-based models are able to flexibly change inference steps for a more detailed generation result (large steps) or a sketchy yet faster generation (small steps).

Earlier in the VAR research, we had tried the two independent encoding ways you mentioned and compared them to the causal one:\n\n- Independently encoding images of different resolutions was nearly impossible because a 16x downsampled VQVAE could barely reconstruct an image with <=64 resolution. Huge color differences and shape deformation.\n- Independent quantization can be seen as the **ablation** on the ""residual quantization"". We had tried this idea and while the reconstruction quality of the VQVAE did not change much, the VAR\'s validation token accuracy decreased a lot (tested on an ImageNet subset with 250 classes):\n\n    |Method|Model|#Para|Accuracy$\\uparrow$|\n    |:-|:-|:-|:-|\n    |Residual quantization|VAR-$d24$|1.0B|3.92%|\n    |Independently quantization|VAR-$d24$|1.0B|3.01%|\n\n- Empirically, a 0.9% accuracy drop implies a huge performance degradation when the model size was close to 1B (can be sensed in Figure 5(c)). Therefore, we abandoned this independent scheme early in our research.\n\nWe do agree with you that ""coarse-to-fine scaled images may indeed not strictly have causal dependency"". **If they don\'t**, the whole generation process is more like a series of super-resolutions; **but if they do**, it\'s much more similar to the way human paintings work: first the whole, then the details, with each step being a **refinement** to all the past steps (due to the **residual**).\n\nWe highly believe the **refinement** is a key to VAR\'s success since it allows VAR to fix past mistakes like a diffusion model. Among AR methods, this is an unique advantage of VAR because it is even impossible for language AR models to do this -- they can\'t correct historical mistakes via some ""residual"" mechanism. We\'ll add these extra ablation studies and discussions to our paper and thanks for your insightful questions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Regarding [A2]\n\nThe tokenizer consists of three parts, the CNN encoder, the quantizer, and the CNN decoder. Multi-scale exists only in the quantizer, so we just need to change the resolution hyperparameters $h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_K$ in the multiscale quantizer, detailed in Algorithm 1 and 2. Since the operations in it are interpolations and convolutions which can generalize to any resolution, no additional operations are needed anymore. In other words, we only need to set $h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_K$ from (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,13,16) to (1,2,3,4,6,9,13,18,24,32) and Algorithm 1 and 2 will still work. We\'ll update our paper to make this more clear.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Regarding [A4]\n\nYes, we agree that ""predicting some spatial positions based on others"" is not direct learned through VAR (which may be learned through BERT, MAE, etc.). But we checked the VAR\'s self-attention score when it generated an image, and observed that many tokens on a certain object\'s body would still show relatively high attention scores. Taking this into account, and the fact that VAR can fully utilize information from all previous scales, it still has the ability to do tasks like inpainting (Figure 8). We\'ll add these explanations to our paper for better presentation.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nThank you again for your insightful and professional comment, which made our work more complete and solid!

(since NeurIPS does not allow authors to upload an image or provide an external link, we put the python code here and it'll plot the masks)\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\npatch_nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16]\nL = sum(pn**2 for pn in patch_nums)\nd = torch.cat([torch.full((pn * pn,), i) for i, pn in enumerate(patch_nums)]).view(1, L, 1)\ndT = d.transpose(1, 2)\nmask_VAR = (d >= dT).reshape(L, L).numpy()\n\nmask_AR = torch.tril(torch.ones(patch_nums[-1]**2, patch_nums[-1]**2)).numpy()\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))\naxs[0].imshow(mask_VAR), axs[0].set_title('mask_VAR'), axs[0].axis('off')\naxs[1].imshow(mask_AR), axs[1].set_title('mask_AR'), axs[1].axis('off')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nFrom the figure one can see that:\n\n- VAR's block-wise causal mask and VQGAN's standard causal mask look very close.\n- Or in other words, VAR still maintains many AR properties.\n- So both VQGAN and VAR can benifit from the batched inference, and their batch size sweet-spots (when the throughput starts saturating) can be close to each other.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe will add all of the above supplementary results and analysis to a new Appendix section named throughput benchmark using batched inference.

We went through each of your questions and our responses again, and found that **only one revision** ([W2] Resolution Flexibility) was not copied to our response. So we provide more evidence for you:\n\n    - The VAR transformers generating 256 and 512 images both use the same multi-scale VQVAE that is trained only on 256 resolution. The good performance of the VAR on the 512 generation task shows the generalizability of VQVAE.\n\n    - This 256-trained multi-scale VQVAE has a good reconstruction FID of 2.28 on the 512 ImageNet validation set.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n3. For your convenience, here we also provide a complete response to your [Q1] question about VQVAE, so you don\'t need to search them in the Overall Author Rebuttal:\n\n- VQVAE rFID: We added an evaluation of rFID to a new Appendix section of ""Comparisons on VAEs"" and also pasted it here. It evaluated different VAEs on the 256px ImageNet validation set. Generally, the number of tokens is crucial to a VAE\'s performance, which shows a trade-off between sequence length and reconstruction FID (rFID). VAR-VQVAE with 680 tokens performs similarly to VQGAN\'s with 1024 tokens.\n| Model | downsampling| num of tokens | rFID$\\downarrow$|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| VQGAN-VQVAE | 16 | 256   | 4.90 |\n| VQGAN-VQVAE | 8  | 1024  | 1.14 |\n| MaskGIT-VQVAE  | 16 | 256  | 2.28 |\n| VAR-VQVAE   | 16 | 680   | 1.00 |\n| SDXL-VAE    | 8  | 1024  | **0.68** |\n\n- pre-training cost: we\'ve added more hyperparameters and training costs in Appendix B: Implementation details, which are: 16 epochs training on OpenImages, batch size 768, fp16 precision by `torch.cuda.amp`, standard AdamW optimizer with betas (0.5, 0.9), learning rate 2e-4 and weight decay 0.005. The loss weight of L2 reconstruction, L1 reconstruction, codebook loss, commitment loss, LPIPS and discriminator are 1.0, 0.2, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.4. This training will take ~60h on 16 A100 80G GPUs.\n\n- why we didn\'t choose other multi-scale quantization ways: if the residual quantization is removed and independently quantization is used (e.g., independently downsampling VAE features, or independently encoding images in 16x16, 32x32, ..., 256x256), the unidirectional dependency of VAR algorithm would be broken. The details can be found in line140 of our paper. To ensure that property, we have to use the residual quantization. We\'ll add these explanations to our manuscript.\n\n- Lack of Ablation Study on VQVAE: Since this work mainly aims to explore a new VAR algorithm, we keep the VQVAE structure as simple as possible. Specifically in line173, we use the same architecture of VQGAN\'s single-scale VQVAE and the multi-scale modules (several convolutions) only contain 0.03M parameters. So comparing VQGAN-VQVAE and our VQVAE can be seen as an ablation of this VQVAE. We\'ve added these to our paper.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe hope the above response can help solve your questions.\nThanks again for your thorough review and looking forward to your reply!'}}, 'id': 'tDoPOSRPiW', 'forum': 'gojL67CfS8', 'replyto': 'MgxuACyk9B', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19076/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19076/Authors'], 'number': 5, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19076/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723106447274, 'cdate': 1723106447274, 'tmdate': 1730889914811, 'mdate': 1730889914811, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': 'Revised Manuscript?'}, 'comment': {'value': 'It seems that the manuscript does not contain your added information.

For example, if the image resolution is 256 and VQ-VAE has a latent size of 32, does VAR operate on resolutions up to 32, or does it extend up to the image resolution?\n\n[A4] Yes, VAR is completely done in the latent space. As mentioned in line307, our VQVAE uses a downsampling ratio of 16. So the largest latet token map $r_K$ of 256px|512px image would have a size of 16|32.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n> [Q2] Is there a loss term missing in equation (5)? VQ-GAN models typically include a commitment loss and a codebook loss, but it appears VAR\'s quantizer only uses one of these losses. Could you provide more details on this part?\n\n[A5] The equation (5) is a simplified version of the loss function in VQ-GAN. We use the same VQVAE training loss as VQGAN so we also have a commitment loss and a codebook loss too. We\'ll update equation (5) to clarify this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> [Q3] Can you provide some intuition on why the transformer part can handle this prediction task effectively? Is it due to the strong conditioning from the lower scales?\n\n[A6] Recall our motivation in line41: ""Our work reconsiders how to order an image.\nHumans typically perceive or create images in a hierachical manner, first capturing the global structure and then local details.\nThis \\textbf{multi-scale, coarse-to-fine} nature suggests an order for images"".\nIf this is acknowledged, then predicting multiple tokens at the same time is natural: it just mimics how human understands or creates images.\n\nOn the other hand, the model and computation scaling is also vital to VAR\'s good performance.

We choose an *exponential function* $h_k=w_k=\\lfloor a\\cdot b^k\\rfloor$ to get these scales because:\n    - As discussed in Appendix F, we can reach a total complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ via an exponential schedule.\n    - We want to increase the number of steps to reach $16\\times 16$ for image quality. An exponential function grows slowly in the early stages and quickly in the later ones. So it allows us to increase steps (mainly in the early stages) without a significant increase in total sequence length.\n    - In practice, we use $a=1.36$ and $b=1.28$ to get that (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,13,16).\n    - We\'ve added these explanations to our manuscript.\n2. reconstruction evaluation: We added an evaluation of rFID to a new Appendix section of ""Comparisons on VAEs"" and also pasted it here. It evaluated different VAEs on the 256px ImageNet validation set. Generally, the number of tokens is crucial to a VAE\'s performance, which shows a trade-off between sequence length and reconstruction FID (rFID). VAR-VQVAE with 680 tokens performs similarly to VQGAN\'s with 1024 tokens.\n| Model | downsampling| num of tokens | rFID$\\downarrow$|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| VQGAN-VQVAE | 16 | 256   | 4.90 |\n| VQGAN-VQVAE | 8  | 1024  | 1.14 |\n| MaskGIT-VQVAE  | 16 | 256  | 2.28 |\n| VAR-VQVAE   | 16 | 680   | 1.00 |\n| SDXL-VAE    | 8  | 1024  | **0.68** |\n3. how to choose the number of scales: see above 1.\n4. code usage of each scale: we counted the code usage of our VQVAE on the 256px ImageNet validation set separately for each scale, and found each scale had a code usage >99%. We\'ve added this to our paper.\n5. do different scales capture similar (spatial) information in the latent space vs the image space: we observed that small scales seemed to encode image\'s low-frequency components while large scales represented high-frequency details. We have added a new Appendix section ""Per-scale visualization of VAR VQVAE"" to show this figure.\n6. VQVAE ablation: Since this work mainly aims to explore a new VAR algorithm, we keep the VQVAE structure as simple as possible. Specifically in line173, we use the same architecture of VQGAN\'s single-scale VQVAE and the multi-scale modules (several convolutions) only contain 0.03M parameters. So comparing VQGAN-VQVAE and our VQVAE can be seen as an ablation of this VQVAE. We\'ve added these to our paper.\n7. details to reproduce the VQVAE: we\'ve added more hyperparameters and training costs in Appendix B: Implementation details, which are: 16 epochs training on OpenImages, batch size 768, fp16 precision by `torch.cuda.amp`, standard AdamW optimizer with betas (0.5, 0.9), learning rate 2e-4 and weight decay 0.005. The loss weight of L2 reconstruction, L1 reconstruction, codebook loss, commitment loss, LPIPS and discriminator are 1.0, 0.2, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.4. This training will take ~60h on 16 A100 80G GPUs.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> [C2] Zero-shot generalisation algorithm\n\nWe\'ll add a pseudo code for detailing the algorithm of zero-shot generalisation in our manuscript.\nThe algorithms of inpainting, outpainting, and class-condition editing are basically the same.\n\nSpecifically, we would mask out the according region at each scale of (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,13,16) given the task, i.e., masking the inner area for inpainting, the outer area for outpainting, and the area we want to edit for editing.\nBy ""according"", we mean some interpolation should be used. E.g., if we want to mask the upper-left 128x128 area of a 256x256 image then do inpainting, the upper-left area of **each scale token map** would be masked.\nDuring each VAR step, non-masked tokens are teacher forced, and VAR only needs to predict tokens on those masked regions.\n\n-----------------------\nFor non-common questions, we\'ve responded below the review comment of each reviewer.\n\n\nBest,\n\nThe Authors'}}, 'id': 'MgxuACyk9B', 'forum': 'gojL67CfS8', 'replyto': 'gojL67CfS8', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19076/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19076/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19076/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723034523995, 'cdate': 1723034523995, 'tmdate': 1730889915053, 'mdate': 1730889915053, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Dear Reviewer dFai,\n\nMany thanks to your professional, detailed, and valuable reviews.

Currently, these details are somewhat obscured in Algorithm 1 and 2, and Figure 4.\n\n[A1] Thank you for your thorough review and suggestion.

Also, this would not devalue VAR\'s novelty and technical contributions.

We\'d first explain why models like MDTv2 was not inclued in  table 1: Since our table 1 mainly focuses on **Generative model family** comparison on class-conditional ImageNet 256x256, we did not include some latest powerful models in it. As also mentioned in line 308, our main focus was on VAR algorithm and we used a plain GPT-2 transformer without SwiGLU, RMSNorm, or Rotary position embedding. So there is still large room to boost VAR. Comparing VAR with other long-optimized diffusion model can be a bit unfair. We have added some explanations and used ""performs competitively"" to describe our VAR.\n\nNonetheless, we added an extra comparison which focuses on comparing VAR with latest, state-of-the-art model to the Appendix. We also updated the Future Work section to see if we can integrate more advanced technique like in MDTv2 or LLaMa to further upgrade VAR.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-------------------------------\n\n**Thanks for your comments and suggestions, we will add these experiments to our revision.

We address your questions as follows.\n\n---------------------------\n\n> [W1 Q1, about the efficiency evaluation] I\'d like to see a throughput comparison in img/s as the batch size is increased. I\'d also like to see some DiT results where a more advanced sampler such as DPM-solver or SA-solver is used.\n\n[A1] Thank you for your suggestions to make our efficiency evaluation more complete and thoughtful!\n\nFirst, we add the throughput comparison with batched inference to our manuscript.\nAll models are tested on a single A100 GPU. VQGAN\'s results are quoted from [1].\nFrom the results we can see that VAR also **gets a big speedup from batch processing**, similarly to vanilla autoregressive models. We attribute this to the short sequence length of the first few VAR steps (like generating $1\\times 1$ and $2\\times 2$ tokens).\nAfter batching, VAR reaches a throughput of 0.04 $\\text{img/s}$, which is still **4 times faster than batched VQGAN**, even if VAR has a larger model size.\n\n|Model|#Para|Batch size|Throughput$\\downarrow$|FID$\\downarrow$|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| VQGAN-re     | 1.4B | 1   | 5.76 $\\text{img/s}$  | 5.20 |\n| VQGAN-re     | 1.4B | 100 | 0.16 $\\text{img/s}$  | 5.20 |\n| VAR-$d30$-re | 2.0B | 1   | 0.24 $\\text{img/s}$  | 1.73 |\n| VAR-$d30$-re | 2.0B | 100 | **0.04 $\\text{img/s}$**  | **1.73** |\n-----------------------\nSecond, we add the results of DiT and U-ViT (another transformer-based diffusion model) with fewer diffusion steps ($<50$) to our manuscript.\nThe results are quoted from [2, 3]. From the table one can see that:\n1) Reducing the number of diffusion steps via ODE sampler (like DDIM, DPM-Solver) will result in a large FID rise, especially when reduced to near 10 steps.\n2) Both using 10 steps, VAR-1B is still **faster and better than DiT-675M**. This is also because VAR has a shorter sequence length in the early steps, e.g., the first three VAR steps only generate $1\\times 1 + 2\\times 2 + 3\\times 3 = 14$ tokens.\n3) The Diffusion community has been building up for a long time for efficiency boosting. In contrast, VAR, as a newly proposed method, promises to see more ways to accelerate or distill VAR in the future. We\'d like to add this to our Future Work section.\n\n|Model|#Para|#Step|Time$\\downarrow$|FID$\\downarrow$|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| VAR-$d24$              | 1.0B | 10 | **0.6** | **2.09** |\n| DiT-XL/2 (original)    | 675M |250 | 45      | 2.27 |\n| DiT-XL/2 + DDIM        | 675M |250 | 45      | 2.14 |\n| DiT-XL/2 + DDIM        | 675M | 20 | 2.9     | 4.68 |\n| DiT-XL/2 + DDIM        | 675M | 10 | 1.8     | 12.38|\n| U-ViT-H/2 + DPM-solver | 501M | 20 | 15.6    | 2.53 |\n| U-ViT-H/2 + DPM-solver | 501M | 10 | 7.8     | 3.18 |\n\n> [W2 Q2, details on multi-scale VQVAE]\n\n[A2] We\'d like to respond to your queries mentioned in Weakness 2 one by one, and add all the details below to Appendix section.\nPlease see the overall Author Rebuttal part of ""VQVAE concerns"" for specific responses.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n> [W3 Q3, The use of ""zero-shot"" to refer to the model\'s editing ability is different in nature to zero-shot generalisation in LLMs; doesn\'t give details on how the editing is performed]\n\n[A3] Thanks for your insightful comments.

To generate $h_k\\times w_k$ tokens $r_k$ in $k$-th autoregressive step (like to generate $r_2$ in Figure 4), the input is the previous token map $r_1$. It\'ll be reshaped to 2D ($1\\times 1$ here), embedded to a 2D feature map, upsampled to $r_2$\'s shape $2 \\times 2$, projected to the VAR transformer\'s hidden dimension, and added by a 2D positional embedding to get $e_1$. So the actual input to the VAR transformer is $e_1$ in Figure 4, and these steps are the details of ""word embedding and up-interpolation"" noted in Figure 4. The detailed implementation can also be found in the code ""codes/models/var.py autoregressive_infer_cfg"" attached in supplementary material.\n\nTo make sure all tokens in $r_k$ are correlated to each other, we don\'t apply attention mask within $r_k$ to keep a bidirectional attention on them. In other words, $r_k$ can attend to all tokens of $r_{\\le k}$\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> [W2] there are 10 scales (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,13,16). I wonder if there is any motivation to choose these scales.\n\n[A2] Yes the chose of scales is a key design of VAR. We choose an *exponential function* $h_k=w_k=\\lfloor a\\cdot b^k\\rfloor$ to get these scales because:\n1) As discussed in appendix F, we can reach a total complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ via an exponential schedule.\n2) We want to increase the number of steps to reach $16\\times 16$ for image quality. An exponential function grows slowly in the early stages and quickly in the later ones. So it allows us to increase steps (mainly in the early stages) without a significant increase in total sequence length.\n\nIn practice, we use $a=1.36$ and $b=1.28$ to get that (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,13,16).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> [W3] I think the paper should include the sampling algorithm of autoregressive model with hyper-parameter details such as temperature, top-k, top-p and CFG sampling.\n\n[A3] We use temperature of $1.0$, top-k of $k=900$, top-p of $p=0.96$, and CFG of $1.25$ (VAR-$d16$) or $1.5$ (the others). We\'ll add these to our manuscript.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> [W4] The zero-shot generalisation algorithm should be included in the paper for clarity.\n\n[A4] Thanks for this valuable advice. We\'ll add a pseudo code for detailing the algorithm of zero-shot generalisation in our manuscript. \nThe algorithms of inpainting, outpainting, and class-condition editing are basically the same.\n\nSpecifically, we would mask out the according region at each scale of (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,13,16) given the task, i.e., masking the inner area for inpainting, the outer area for outpainting, and the area we want to edit for editing.

The comparison with DiT uses 250 steps, which is much more than what SotA samplers require. Moreover, diffusion models can be distilled into 1-4 step models that are even faster.  Compared to raster scan autoregressive models, the improvement in latency seems to be due to better use of parallel resources. However, for larger batches/measuring throughput this advantage may fade. \n2. There are some missing details and insight, especially with regards to the multi-scale VQVAE. There are also details that are present in the code that really should be in the paper, such as the number of tokens per image/scale. What is its reconstruction performance of the VQVAE (compared to e.g. the SDXL VAE)? How does one choose the number of scales?  How many codes end up being used over the different scales and do different scales capture similar (spatial) information in the latent space vs the image space? It would also be great to see an ablation like Table 3 for the VQVAE. Also, the code provided doesn\'t give details to reproduce the VQVAE, only the transformer.\n3. The use of ""zero-shot"" to refer to the model\'s editing ability is different in nature to zero-shot generalisation in LLMs, so I find the link made in the paper to be a little disingenuous.

However, these methods often underperform compared to full fine-tuning, particularly in scenarios involving complex datasets. This issue becomes even more pronounced in complex domains, highlighting the need for improved PEFT approaches that can achieve better performance. Through a series of experiments, we have uncovered two critical insights that shed light on the training and parameter inefficiency of LoRA.

We hereby address your concerns below:\n\n> W1 & Q1: Exploring potential limitations of this design.\n\nThanks for the insightful question. The limitations may primarily stem from the training data. Particularly, in multi-task, extreme conditions such as contaminated or adversarial data can severely impair performance due to aggregation. The heterogeneity between tasks—differences in language, task type, and domain—means that the shared knowledge might be weaker or less noteworthy.  Importantly, this challenge is not unique to HydraLoRA but is common across all multi-task frameworks. Robustness enhancement (such as data sanitization, robust aggregation, and anomaly detection) and privacy-enhancing technologies (like homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and blockchain) may be potential solutions.\n\n> W2: Automatic routing v.s manual predefined tasks.\n\nIn Table 3, the LoRA MoE baselines [1,2] utilize existing domain knowledge (manual) to train multiple LoRA units, whereas HydraLoRA employs automatic routing. The results indicate that HydraLoRA uses **fewer parameters and performs better in downstream tasks**. This suggests potential coupling relationships between tasks, aligning closely with real-world conditions where we cannot anticipate the domains needing fine-tuning. \nMoreover, Section 4.5 reveals that the **number of clusters K is not a sensitive parameter** for HydraLoRA. It demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of HydraLoRA.\n\n> W3: More streamlined presentation.\n\nThanks for your constructive comment. We will revise the paper based on your suggestions in the updated version.\n\n> W4 & Q2: More MoE discussion.\n\nThanks for your constructive comment.  We add more experiments with the same setting with Table 3, to explore how the number of experts (B matrices) during the HydraLoRA inference pipeline influences performance. As shown in the Table below, we find that an increase in the number of B matrices generally leads to enhanced performance in downstream tasks. \n\nIn practice, **user requests may belong to different tasks, while a single request potentially involves mixed tasks**. This improvement can be attributed to the expanded configuration space afforded by additional LoRA modules, which allows for a more fine-grained and tailored adaptation to the diverse and mixed-task inputs encountered in the benchmark.\n\n| Methods | Base | Top-1  | Top-3 | HydraLoRA |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| **BBH**  | 31.6   | 35.4 | 38.6 | 41.5   |\n\nTable: Sensitivity analysis of the number of B matrices.

HydraLoRA, an adaptation of LoRA, enhances downstream task performance with the same parameter settings (rank=16), as demonstrated in Table 2. \n\nMoreover, as Figure 5 illustrates, HydraLoRA **cuts energy consumption by 50%** compared to Split-LoRA, which uses multiple LoRA modules. This underscores HydraLoRA\'s efficiency and **eco-friendly**. However, LoRA\'s carbon footprint is negligible compared to full-parameter tuning, emphasizing its environmental and computational advantages [3]. Meanwhile, **fine-tuning is a one-time event, but inference overhead is crucial**. As fellows, HydraLoRA boosts performance with minimal additional overhead. \n\n|  |Latency(s)|Energy(Wh)|MMLU(%)|\n|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|**LLaMA2-7B**|90.21|72.72|38.88|\n|**+Prompt Tuning**|91.78(+1.57)|73.53(+0.81)|39.91(+1.03)|\n|**+P-Tuning**|91.3(+1.13)|73.87(+1.15)|41.11(+2.23)|\n|**+Prefix Tuning**|92.52(+2.31)|74.21(+1.49)|41.78(+2.90)|\n|**+LoRA (r=8)**|92.28(+2.07)|73.95(+1.23)|43.22(4.34)|\n|**+HydraLoRA (r=8)**|92.86(+2.65)|74.25(+1.53)|47.22(+8.34)|\n\nTable:  latency and energy consumption during inference using Llama2-7B with different PEFT methods, evaluated on the WikiText2 dataset using a single NVIDIA A40 GPU.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Pushing mixture of experts to the limit: Extremely parameter efficient moe for instruction tuning.

We hereby address your concerns below：\n\n> W1：Clarify asymmetric structure and workflow. \n\n- ***Asymmetric structure***:  Figure 3 presents the post-fine-tuning characteristics of the LoRA module within Llama-7B across four different tasks, analyzing the same submodules.  Figure 3a displays the total 4x128 submodules across four LoRAs. Figure 3b illustrates the breakdown of the A matrices (even-numbered), **the same submodules  ( same index) overlap significantly, making them indistinguishable**. Conversely, Figure 3c shows the B matrix breakdown (odd-numbered) where, after training on different tasks, **the same submodules demonstrate distinct differences, facilitating clear differentiation**. This analysis substantiates the HydraLoRA approach of sharing the ""A"" module and training distinct ""B"" modules to perfectly couple the **synergies and differences** across tasks.\n\n- ***Workflow***. For Section 3.2, the HydraLoRA fine-tuning first involves categorizing datasets to initialize the number of B matrices, essentially constructing asymmetric structures. Subsequently, these B matrices serve as the experts of MoE (Eq. 3). We\'d like to clarify that **HydraLoRA goes beyond a simple MoE for the PEFT approaches**. Our core focus is on **better understanding and analyzing the LoRA structure** (line 35), which delivers superior model performance while maintaining the efficiency benefits of a reduced parameter footprint.\n\n> W2：Novelty of HydraLoRA & Compared with a LoRA MoE Work: MOLE [1].\n\n- **Novelty**. We\'d like to clarify that HydraLoRA represents an asymmetric **architecture** enhancement of the vanilla LoRA, while existing LoRA MoE approaches [1,2,3,4] serve as LoRA **frameworks** for multi-tasks. **MoE plays a secondary role** in HydraLoRA. We leverage it as a method to aggregate these asymmetric B-matrix modules. Thus, **HydraLoRA architecture** can be **seamlessly adapted into** existing enhancements to the LoRA MoE framework, further extending its capabilities and effectiveness. \n\n- **Compared with MOLE [1]**.  As the reviewer mentioned, we had noticed the LoRA MoE work MOLE [1] before, but since it is **NOT open-sourced** (https://github.com/yushuiwx/MoLE/issues). To be fair, in Table 3, we compare HydraLoRA with another similar LoRA MoE work ICLR 2024 [2] and COLM 2024 [3]. Meanwhile, we have attempted to reproduce MOLE [1], which is not a guaranteed fair comparison. The results are as follows, MOLE underperformances [2, 3], and  HydraLoRA still achieves better performance, which **further proves the strong adaptability and efficiency of HydraLoRA**.\n\n|Llama2-7B|Base|Lorahub [3]|LoRA MoE [2]|MOLE [1] |HydraLoRA|\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|**BBH**|31.6|39.7|40.3|37.4|41.5|\n\n\n> W3：Results are incremental.\nHydraLoRA achieves superior performance on downstream tasks with fewer parameters. Specifically,\n- Compared with LoRA (r=8), HydraLoRA (r=8) demonstrates a **performance gain of over 5%**, as shown in Table 2; \n- Compared with strategies that employ multiple LoRAs directly for Mixture of Experts (Table 3) and LoRA (r=32) (Table 2), HydraLoRA enhances efficiency by sharing the ""A"" module to capture task synergies and training distinct ""B"" modules to recognize task differences. Consequently, HydraLoRA significantly **reduces about 88.5% of parameters** compared to existing methods [2].\n\n> Q1: Comparison of inference speed.\n\nFor inference, the speed is primarily influenced by the base model. Since the parameters of PEFT modules constitute a small fraction of the total model parameters (ranging from 0.001% to 0.248% as shown in Table 2), the inference latency differences among various PEFT methods are minimal. \n\nThe following presents the latency and energy consumption during inference using Llama2-7B with different PEFT methods, evaluated on the WikiText2 dataset using a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. The results show nearly equal energy consumption and latency, but HydraLoRA exhibits the highest model performance.\n\n|  |Latency(s)|Energy(Wh)|MMLU(%)|\n|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|**LLaMA2-7B**|90.21|72.72|38.88|\n|**+Prompt Tuning**|91.78(+1.57)|73.53(+0.81)|39.91(+1.03)|\n|**+P-Tuning**|91.3(+1.13)|73.87(+1.15)|41.11(+2.23)|\n|**+Prefix Tuning**|92.52(+2.31)|74.21(+1.49)|41.78(+2.90)|\n|**+LoRA (r=8)**|92.28(+2.07)|73.95(+1.23)|43.22(4.34)|\n|**+HydraLoRA (r=8)**|92.86(+2.65)|74.25(+1.53)|47.22(+8.34)|\n\n> Q2：Comparison of training overhead.\n\n- ***Compared with LoRA variants and LoRA MoE methods***.\nHydraLoRA not only enhances performance with the same parameters LoRA variants (rank=16) as shown in Table 2, but it also demonstrates **substantial parameter reductions** compared with LoRA MoE— **reducing 88.5% compared to [2] and 72.5% to [3]** as shown in Table 3. Moreover, as Figure 5 illustrates, HydraLoRA **cuts energy consumption by 50%** compared to Split-LoRA, which uses multiple LoRA modules. This underscores HydraLoRA\'s efficiency and system-friendly.\n\n- ***Compared with other PEFT***. While the vanilla LoRA method involves a higher computational overhead than other PEFT strategies, it offers significant performance gains, as shown in Table 2.  However, LoRA\'s carbon footprint is **negligible** compared to full-parameter tuning, emphasizing its environmental and computational advantages[4].  Meanwhile, the **fine-tuning is a one-time event**, but inference overhead is crucial.

We hereby address your concerns below：\n\n> W1: HydraLoRA still underperforms full fine-tuning.\n\n- ***HydraLoRA is more efficient***. HydraLoRA offers the advantage of low training overhead, allowing LLMs to adapt to specific domain tasks more efficiently than Full Fine-Tuning (FFT).  Although HydraLoRA may not match FFT in model performance, as depicted in Figure 2, FFT adjusts all parameters (as shown in Table 2, **FFT modifies tunable parameters about 800 times higher than HydraLoRA**), which better captures downstream task features but also incurs substantial costs that may be **prohibitive for end-users**.  **FFT cannot construct efficient multi-head structures** like LoRA.  Meanwhile, compared to other PEFT methods, **HydraLoRA minimizes this performance gap with FFT**, as shown in Table 2.\n\n- ***HydraLoRA is more robust and adaptive***. As the downstream tasks dynamically evolve, the overhead of re-running the FFT process is significant. However, **HydraLoRA easily adapts to the changes** due to its plug-and-play and asymmetric architecture.\n\n> W2: Ablation where only one of the B matrices.\n\nThanks for your constructive comment.

We place an example heatmap figure in the overall rebuttal pdf.\n\n> Q3: How does lora_split in Table 1 classify the data?\n\nTo simulate real-world scenarios, we cannot know in advance the domains of data that require fine-tuning. Therefore, **Split-LoRA, a baseline we proposed**, performs k-means clustering on the data and then fine-tunes it for different categories. This approach underscores the importance of exploiting asymmetry in HydraLoRA.\n\n> Q4: The performance of Split_LoRA in Table 3.\n\nFor a single dataset, no existing studies have discussed multi-LoRA fine-tuning methods, prompting us to introduce the LoRA-Split variant. In contrast, Table 3 focuses on multi-task\n scenarios, where numerous methods[1,2,3,4] already exist. Therefore, we directly compared our approach with established LoRA MoE methods [1,2].\n\n> Q4: L193 “With equivalent parameters (rank=16)”\n\nIn Table 2, HydraLoRA (r=8) refers to each A/B matrices with a rank of 8, yet the total parameter count is equivalent to a single LoRA module with a rank of 16, due to multiple B matrices.

We hereby address your concerns below：\n\n> W1& Limitation2: HydraLoRA has multiple adapter copies.\n\nThe reason for multiple ""B"" modules is that, in practice, downstream tasks are often complex and **multi-task**. Traditional PEFT  methods typically focus on optimizing for a single task. Tuning a single LoRA to serve all tasks without considering the task differences can lead to reduced performance.  \n\nCurrent approaches [1,2,3,4] often **train multiple LoRA modules for multiple tasks, similarly overlooking the task synergies**. In contrast, HydraLoRA, by sharing the ""A"" module and training distinct ""B"" modules, perfectly couples these two features, leading to **superior performance**. Moreover, by sharing the ""A"" module, HydraLoRA significantly **reduces the parameter count to just 11.5% of that of existing methods** [2], as detailed in Table 3. Nonetheless, the additional computation introduced is negligible compared to the parameters of LLMs themselves, as shown in Table 2 where HydraLoRA accounts for only 0.124% of the total parameters.\n\n> W2: Environmental footprint of model training.\n\nWhile the vanilla LoRA method incurs higher computational overhead compared to other PEFT approaches, it also **delivers significant performance improvements**. HydraLoRA, an adaptation of LoRA, enhances downstream task performance with the same parameter settings (rank=16), as demonstrated in Table 2. \n\nMoreover, as Figure 5 illustrates, HydraLoRA **cuts energy consumption by 50% compared to Split-LoRA**, which uses multiple LoRA modules. This underscores HydraLoRA\'s efficiency and its eco-friendly nature. Additionally, the **carbon footprint of fine-tuning LoRA is effectively negligible when contrasted with full-parameter tuning**, highlighting its environmental and computational benefits [5].\n\n> W3: Primarily on LoRA, not test other PEFT configurations.\n\nOur core focus is on **better understanding and analyzing the LoRA structure** (line 35). We first perform a thorough analysis of the LoRA structure, showing that the asymmetry  (Figure 3) is primarily due to the different initialization methods of the A and B matrices. However, this characteristic may not be directly transferable to other PEFT methods. We appreciate your suggestion and will consider how similar explorations might be applied to other PEFT techniques.\n\n\n> W4: Outside the experimental setup is not discussed.\n\nWe have validated HydraLoRA on representative **single-domain** datasets in General, Medical, Law, Math, and Code (line166 - line175), as well as on the **multi-domain** dataset Flanv2, which covers 10 distinct task clusters (line175 - line178), effectively simulating common scenarios. We hope this addresses the reviewer\'s question and we are willing to answer more questions about the setup.\n\n\n> Q1&Limitation3: HydraLoRA\'s asymmetric structure interpretability.\n\nOur analysis of the LoRA module breakdown (Figure 3) revealed asymmetrical properties of the A-B modules: post-training, the **A module shows similarities across tasks, whereas the B module exhibits distinct differences**. This observation aligns with the synergies and differences encountered in downstream multi-task learning with LLMs. Consequently, we have refined the existing LoRA structure and introduced the HydraLoRA asymmetric architecture (Figure 1.C). In this design, the A module captures the commonalities of knowledge, while the B module captures specific characteristics. We hope this addresses the reviewer\'s question. Could the reviewer please clarify what is meant by “interpretability of the model”? We apologize for any confusion.\n\n> Q2&Limitation1: Initialization of K-means.\n\nAs discussed in Section 4.5, we find that the number k of clusters is **NOT a sensitive parameter** for HydraLoRA with a wide range of reasonable number k of clusters performing decently well in all settings in our experiments (Figure 8). We also compare K-means with sophisticated hyperparameter search approaches and find that K-means is simple but effective (Figure 7).\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Mixture of LoRA Experts, ICLR 2024.\n\n[2] Pushing mixture of experts to the limit: Extremely parameter efficient moe for instruction tuning.

Specifically:\n    * The authors use t-SNE visualizations to analyze the parameter distributions of LoRA modules trained on different data subsets. This approach reveals a clear pattern: the ""A"" matrices of these modules tend to converge, indicating common knowledge acquisition, while the ""B"" matrices remain distinct, suggesting they specialize in task-specific features. This key finding highlights the inherent asymmetric nature of knowledge representation within LoRA and provides the foundation for HydraLoRA\'s design.\n    * Building upon this insight, the authors demonstrate that splitting a single LoRA into multiple, smaller ones, each trained on a different data subset (LoRA-Split), leads to significant performance improvements.

While both methods utilize MoE, HydraLoRA consistently demonstrates superior performance.

The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks.

Regarding the concerns and questions:\n\n> The results on images do not clearly demonstrate the distribution coverage shown in the toy example. It appears that the low-quality model provides low-frequency guidance during generation, while the high-quality model focuses more on details. This approach results in sacrificing diversity for quality, contrary to what is depicted in Fig. 1. Additionally, Table 1 should include the Inception score in addition to the FID. Peculiar also the choice of omegas in Table 1; I wonder how the authors choose these values. A fair comparison between CFG and their method would be sufficient with omega={1,1.5,2,2.5,...}\n\nAs far as we know, there is no simple relationship between the frequency bands of the sampled image and the roles of the main and guiding models. Given that FID is very sensitive to diversity [1], our lower FIDs are a strong indication that diversity is not lost. We did not measure IS separately, as it is known to be largely consistent with FID (see Figs. 5a, 11b of the EDM2 paper [2]), at least with the EDM2 models that we use in the quantitative measurements.\n\nGuidance weights in Table 1 are the ones that gave the best results according to the hyperparameter search outlined in Appendix B.1.

I would expect that the low-capacity model could function in this auto-guiding setup, but an under-trained approach might face significant generalization issues. ...\n\nWith autoguidance, the majority of the benefits can be obtained by using an earlier training snapshot of the main model as the guiding model (Table 1, row “reduce training only”, also Section 5.1), in which case no additional training is required. Under-training is therefore a practical approach for creating effective guiding models.\n\nIn contrast, reducing the amount of training data for the guiding model did not seem to yield a benefit (see end of Section 5.1). We did not consider reducing the amount of training data for the guiding model as a goal in itself, as the full dataset is used for training the main high-quality model in any case. That said, it may be possible to reduce the data at least somewhat when training the low-quality model without ill effects.\n\n> Q1. In the CFG paper, a complete table of FID and IS values at various omega settings is provided (omega={1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4...}).

I am interested in seeing the use of a quantized model as the low-quality model for auto-guidance.\n\nAccording to our initial tests, increased quantization does not yield a model that could be used as the low-quality guiding model (see end of Section 5.1).\n\n> Q3. Additional examples of generated images or access to the code would be beneficial for comparing the auto-guidance method with CFG.\n\nThe code will be released after the review cycle.\n\n> The method requires training two diffusion models as opposed to just one with CFG. This difference is critical when scaling up the training of foundation models.\n\nHaving to train a separate guiding model in order to obtain full benefits of our method is indeed a limitation, but when using a smaller model and shorter training time for the guiding model, the additional training cost is modest. For example, the EDM2-M model trains approximately 2.7x as fast as EDM2-XXL per iteration, and we train it for 1/3.5 of iterations, so the additional cost is around +11% of training the main model. For the EDM2-S/XS pair used in most of our experiments, the added training cost is only +3.6%. We shall clarify this in the paper.\n\nAlso, as discussed above, using an earlier training snapshot of the main model as the guiding model yields most of the benefits of autoguidance without requiring any additional training.'}}, 'id': '0LSGWVYooH', 'forum': 'bg6fVPVs3s', 'replyto': 'zLpocWc3dJ', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10530/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10530/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10530/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723031146597, 'cdate': 1723031146597, 'tmdate': 1730882383798, 'mdate': 1730882383798, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thank you for the review.

(I am convinced by your synthetic experiment). Even if $p_1(x|c;\\sigma)$ and $p_0(x|c;\\sigma)$ suffer from different kinds of degradation, empirically the ratio of them is still possible to pull the sampling trajectory towards the high-likelihood region. If possible, could you give some toy mathematical examples about this?\n\nLet us construct a toy scenario where the ratio of two differently degraded densities would yield a misleading guidance signal. Assume that the true distribution is a unit 2D Gaussian with diagonal covariances $[1,\\ 1]$, and the two degraded versions have diagonal covariances $[1+e,\\ 1]$ and $[1,\\ 1+e]$ for some relatively small $e$. Now, guidance between these densities would push the samples inward along one axis and outward (towards lower likelihood) along the other, despite them both being centered around the correct distribution. Similarly, offsetting the means to unrelated directions would induce an overall force towards some global direction, rather than consistently towards the origin.\n\nIn a more abstract sense, the beneficial degradations appear to push and spread the densities along locally consistent directions as a function of the degradation strength, but this is ultimately an empirical finding. On the other hand, entirely different types of degradations have a lot of room for mutually inconsistent behavior.\n\n> Q2. For Figure 1(e), the author applies autoguidance to the toy model.

In addition to improvement in quality, CFG is also heavily used to improve text-image alignment. Can you provide a more detailed experiment on how autoguidance affects this aspect? From the images, it seems that some degree of CFG is still needed for optimal text-image alignment.\n\nWe did not run any prompt alignment metrics, so we have no quantitative data about this. Intuitively, it seems probable that the effect of autoguidance on prompt alignment is smaller than with CFG, because both models are being conditioned with the text prompt. However, as the guiding model is smaller and/or less trained, it probably responds to the condition less strongly than the main model, and thus the prompt is probably emphasized to some degree as the guidance weight is increased.\n\nIn the paper, we advocate mixing autoguidance with CFG for further creative control and provide a simple method for doing so (Appendix B.2).\n\n> Q3. Can you provide some intuition on how to choose the guiding model besides grid-search? It seems very costly to train multiple different models just to see which one works better as the guidance model, especially if the same method is applied to text-to-image models trained on massive datasets.\n\nBased on our experiments, a model of a third to a half the size of the main model is a good starting point, and the evaluations should begin around 1/16 of training iterations, or perhaps even earlier for very small models. As seen in Figure 3(a, b), doubling or halving the capacity or training time doesn’t result in any sort of catastrophic quality drop, so these parameters are not overly sensitive.

In contrast, autoguidance is not expected to suffer from this problem at high noise levels, as both models target the same distribution.

"['Qiguang Chen', 'Libo Qin', 'Jiaqi Wang', 'Jingxuan Zhou', 'Wanxiang Che']",NeurIPS,Unlocking the Capabilities of Thought_ A Reasoning Boundary Framework to Quantify and Optimize Chain-of-Thought,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97955,2024," Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Recently, a series of studies attempt to explain the mechanisms underlying CoT, aiming to deepen the understanding of its efficacy. Nevertheless, the existing research faces two major challenges: (1) a lack of quantitative metrics to assess CoT capabilities and (2) a dearth of guidance on optimizing CoT performance. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce a novel reasoning boundary framework (RBF) to address these challenges. To solve the lack of quantification, we first define a reasoning boundary (RB) to quantify the upper-bound of CoT and establish a combination law for RB, enabling a practical quantitative approach applicable to various real-world CoT tasks. To address the lack of optimization, we propose three categories of RBs. We further optimize these categories with combination laws focused on RB promotion and reasoning path optimization for CoT improvement. Through extensive experiments on 27 models and 5 tasks, the study validates the existence and rationality of the proposed framework. Furthermore, it explains the effectiveness of 10 CoT strategies and guides optimization from two perspectives. We hope this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of the boundaries and optimization strategies for reasoning in LLMs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/LightChen233/reasoning-boundary.",Oral Session 3C: Natural Language Processing,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=pC44UMwy2v,https://openreview.net/forum?id=pC44UMwy2v,pC44UMwy2v,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'The aim of this paper is to improve the ability of Large Language Models in solving complex reasoning tasks by addressing two main drawbacks in the Chain-Of-Thought (CoT) approach: the lack of quantification metrics and the absence of optimization guidance.

It satisfies that:\n$$\nG=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{G_{1}}+k}\n$$\n\nFor example, on the MGSM task, multilingual reasoning granularity is extremely difficult to measure. We directly use the performance of the direct prompting strategy on MGSM without any CoT output as the multi-language reasoning granularity to calculate the corresponding normalization constant. Further, we utilize multilingual CoT on MGSM to calculate combined combination law. This approach may be more general and fit your needs.\n\nAdditionally, as previously detailed in the rebuttal, in cases of approximate or incomplete segmentation, it is sufficient to consolidate these reasoning granularities into the constant $k$.\n\n**Application Section:** In the application part, when using combination law to explain why Tool Usage and PoT work, from a theoretical perspective, these difficulties are not required for calculation. In addition, the MARP we proposed based on combination law can also dynamically adjust different reasoning granularities to ensure performance without difficulty calculation, and its generalization has also been verified in datasets with huge differences in multiple fields.\n\n2. **Concern about difficulty calculation on HotpotQA.**\n\nFor HotpotQA complexity evaluation, we utilized the rationale manually annotated by HotpotQA, observing that few non-bridge entities appeared, providing an approximate measure of the single-step difficulty. For example:\n- Q: Chikku Bhukku is based on a 2003 movie, which was directed by whom?\n- A: Kwak Jae-yong\n- R:\n  - Step1: The movie is based on the [2003] movie [""The Classic""].\n  - Step2: [""The Classic""] is a [2003] romance melodrama film directed by [Kwak Jae-yong].\n\nIn this instance, the single-step statement ""The movie is based on the [2003] movie [""The Classic""]."" is definitely less complex than ""The movie is based on the [2003] movie."" as it imposes a lower cognitive and knowledge load for LLMs.\n\nAll in all, we appreciate your valuable suggestions again and will incorporate additional discussions in the next version of our work.'}}, 'id': '9UuEBipVJc', 'forum': 'pC44UMwy2v', 'replyto': 'HityyL3n6I', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16884/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16884/Authors'], 'number': 11, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16884/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723633200261, 'cdate': 1723633200261, 'tmdate': 1730889653457, 'mdate': 1730889653457, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': 'Thanks for your responses.

We value the opportunity to address the concerns identified. Our responses to the enumerated points are as follows:\n\n---\n**Q1:** Can you provide more detailed examples of tasks that fall into each of the three RG categories? How do these categories affect the model’s optimization process?\n\n**R1:** Thank you for your enlightening advice. Examples of our different inference granularities are as follows:\n\n- **CFRG:**\n```\nA ship traverses the ocean waves. Below are entries from the ship's logbook:\n- The ship sailed 31 kilometers north.\n- Heading northward, the ship ventured 6 times further than it did yesterday.\n\nHow much distance has it covered from the beginning?\n```\n\n- **PFRG:**\n```\nA boat traverses the ocean waves. Below are entries from the boat's logbook:\n- The boat navigated 42 kilometers southward.\n- Navigating north, the boat traveled 570 times the distance it had managed yesterday.\n- The boat journeyed 165 kilometers in a southerly direction.\n- The boat navigated 339 kilometers northward.\n\nWhat is the distance from its origin?\n```\n\n- **CIRG:**\n```\nUpon the vast expanse of the sea sails a vessel. Herein are the chronicles from the vessel's diary:\n- The vessel traveled 564 kilometers towards the west.\n- The vessel navigated 856 kilometers eastward.\n- The vessel traveled 439 kilometers towards the west.\n- The vessel sailed 990 kilometers west.\n- The vessel journeyed 291 kilometers in a easterly direction.\n- Navigating east, the vessel traveled 490 times the distance it had managed yesterday.\n- The vessel navigated 161 kilometers westward.\n- The vessel sailed 914 kilometers west.\n- The vessel sailed 649 kilometers west.\n- The vessel traveled 6 kilometers towards the west.\n\nWhat is the extent of its travel from the starting location?\n```\n\nAs shown in the example, the calculation amount and calculation steps of different cases increase, but the core logic of the problem does not change in any way. In fact, as shown in Figure 4 in the paper, different granularities receive different benefits from self-consistency, and PFRG significantly affects the performance of the Self-consistency optimization strategy. In addition, as shown in Figures 5 and 8 in the paper, different models and different strategies actually improve model performance from different angles by optimizing PFRG and CIRG.\n\n---\n**Q2:** How robust is the combination law of RG across different types of reasoning tasks? Are there specific scenarios where this law does not hold or requires adjustments?\n\n**R2:** Since the combination law conforms to the weighted harmonic mean, it has excellent and robust properties for diverse scenarios. You only need to ensure relatively independent segmentation into several reasoning granularities, which can effectively utilize our framework. Specifically, for any CoT vertical domain problem, two reasoning granularities can be divided into task-planning and vertical domain solution, which satisfy that:\n\n$$\nG=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{G_p}+\\frac{1}{G_v}+k_1}\n$$\n\n- If you ignore a certain reasoning granularity, it will only cause $k$ to increase.\n- If your reasoning granularity is divided reasonably, it will make $k=0$.\n- If you want to further divide $G_v$ into $G_{v1}$ and $G_{v2}$, it is also very convenient. There is no need to consider additional new formulas, because the following formula is satisfied:\n\n$$\nG_v=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{G_{v1}}+\\frac{1}{G_{v2}}+k_2}\n$$\n$$\nG=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{G_p}+\\frac{1}{G_{v1}}+\\frac{1}{G_{v2}}+k_2+k_1}\n$$\n\n---\n**Q3:** This may raise concerns about the generality of the solution on other types of reasonings, for example in StrategyQA, or planning benchmarks.\n\n**R3:** Thank you for your recognition of our work. In fact, we have conducted non-mathematical experiments. As shown in Figure 3 (c) and Figure 10 in original paper, we have conducted an analysis of multi-hop QA and even multilingual scenarios.\nIn addition, in order to dispel your doubts, we have decomposed the Medical Knowledge Probing problem in detail according to the steps and related medical entities.  As shown in Figure 2 in the supplementary material, the combination law is also satisfied in this benchmark.\n\nIn addition, as shown in Table 1 below, the MARP we proposed can also work on this data set and can achieve SOTA results on Medical Knowledge Probing, StrategyQA, and HotpotQA. Specifically, our observations are:\n- **Planning RG Optimization:** The performance on Medical Knowledge Probing and StrategyQA has improved, and brought great token savings. It shows that our method effectively reduces the original planning RG and optimized the overall performance according to the combination law.\n- **Entity RG Optimization:** For HotpotQA, MARP did not change token usage significantly but increased accuracy. This suggests that shorter demonstrations in HotpotQA benefit from a smaller planning RG, but instroduce larger the local entity RG.\n    Therefore, according to the combination law, by appropriately keeping the planning RG, entity RG can be optimized based on MARP, which makes the problem difficulty less than the combined RG, thereby improving performance.\n\nWe will add more discussion in next version.\n\n|***HOTPOTQA[1]***||||\n|--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n||**Input Token**|**Output Token**|**ACC**|\n|CoT|**289.50**|**67.27**|26.50|\n|CoT-MRP|309.51|68.39|**28.73**|\n|***Med_Prob[2]***||||\n|CoT|636.11|249.78|48.9|\n|CoT-MRP|**476.11**|**86.52**|**69.41**|\n|***StrategyQA[3]***||||\n|CoT|1046.28|225.35|63.90|\n|CoT-MRP|**649.28**|**167.40**|**74.09**|\n||\n\nTable 1: Effectiveness of MARP strategies on different tasks.\n\n[1] Yang et al.

Below, we provide our detailed responses to each of the points raised:\n\n---\n**Q1:** **Lack of Theoretical Analysis**: While the paper provides an empirical framework and experimental validation, it may not delve deeply enough into the theoretical understanding of the concept of Reasoning Granularity (RG). A more rigorous theoretical foundation, although difficult, could strengthen the arguments and enhance the contribution of the paper.\n\n**R1:** Thank you for your suggestion. In fact, our paper has a theoretical analysis in Appendix A.1. Specifically, for the two core concepts of this article, our theoretical analysis is as follows:\n1. **Reasoning Granularity:** In fact, the existence of a universal RG upper limit has actually been done, so we don't need additional elaboration [1]. Based on the proof, it is also obvious that there are different upper bounds for different task conditions.\n2. **Combination Law:** In fact, we provide **a theoretical analysis of this formula in Appendix A.1** for combination law, and we prove that it is theoretically consistent with Combination Law under the condition that the RG is relatively independent.\nWe will add more discussion in the next version.\n\n[1] Towards revealing the mystery behind chain of thought: a theoretical perspective. NeurIPS 2024.\n\n---\n**Q2:** The RG framework, although validated across 25 models and 4 tasks, may not be fully generalizable to all types of large language models or reasoning tasks.\n\n**R2:** Thank you for your insightful comment. In fact, our method can be generalized to other tasks.\n\nSpecifically, when encountering a new scenario, we will discuss how to utilize the framework and solve the problems effectively:\n- **Framework Utilization**: Since the combination law conforms to the weighted harmonic mean, it has excellent properties. You only need to be able to ensure relatively independent segmentation into several reasoning granularities, which can effectively utilize our framework.\n\n    Specifically, for any CoT vertical domain problem, two reasoning granularities can be divided into task-planning and vertical domain solution, which satisfy that:\n    $$\n    G=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{G_p} + \\frac{1}{G_v} +k_1}\n    $$\n    - If you ignore a certain reasoning granularity, it will only cause $k$ to increase.\n    - If your reasoning granularity is divided reasonably, it will make $k=0$.\n    - If you want to further divide $G_v$ into $G_{v1}$ and $G_{v2}$, it is also very convenient. There is no need to consider additional new formulas, because the following formula is satisfied:\n\n    $$\n    G_v=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{G_{v1}} + \\frac{1}{G_{v2}} +k_2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    G=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{G_p} + \\frac{1}{G_{v1}} + \\frac{1}{G_{v2}} +k_2 +k_1}\n    $$\n- **Framework Generalization:** As shown in Figure 3 (c) in the original article and Figure 2 in the supplementary material, we can also verify the existence of Combination Law on tasks such as HotpotQA and Medical Knowledge Probing. In addition, our proposed MARP strategy significant improves performance (2.23%-20.51%) and reduces token cost (-1.63%-188%) on these tasks and StrategyQA. Specifically, our observations are:\n    - **Planning RG Optimization:** The performance on Medical Knowledge Probing and StrategyQA has improved, and brought great token savings. It shows that our method effectively reduces the original planning RG and optimized the overall performance according to the combination law.\n    - **Entity RG Optimization:** For HotpotQA, MARP did not change token usage significantly but increased accuracy. This suggests that shorter demonstrations in HotpotQA benefit from a smaller planning RG, but instroduce larger the local entity RG.\n    Therefore, according to the combination law, by appropriately keeping the planning RG, entity RG can be optimized based on MARP, which makes the problem difficulty less than the combined RG, thereby improving performance.\n\nWe will add more discussion in next version.\n\n|***HOTPOTQA[1]*** | |||\n| --: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| | **Input Token** | **Output Token** | **ACC** |\n| CoT | **289.50** | **67.27** | 26.50 |\n| CoT-MRP | 309.51 | 68.39 | **28.73** |\n| ***Med_Prob[2]*** | |||\n| CoT | 636.11 | 249.78 | 48.9 |\n| CoT-MRP | **476.11** | **86.52** | **69.41** |\n| ***StrategyQA[3]*** | |||\n| CoT | 1046.28 | 225.35 | 63.90 |\n| CoT-MRP | **649.28** | **167.40** | **74.09** |\n||\n\nTable 1: Effectiveness of MARP strategies on different tasks for GPT3.5.\n\n[1] Yang et al.

Can you justify this choice?\n\n**R1:** Thanks for your constructive comment. In fact, the reasoning path of the answer to this question is completely affected by several core entities and entity relations for multi-hop data construction, which are also mentioned in HotpotQA original paper[1].

Our intuition for using this classification is that a model with 90% accuracy actually means almost complete mastery, while 10% accuracy means absolutely no ability to do it.\n\nIn addition, we have conducted preliminary experiments on multiple models and found that no matter how the prompt changes, the accuracy difference will not exceed 2%.

Recently, a series of studies attempt to explain the mechanisms underlying CoT, aiming to deepen the understanding of its efficacy. Nevertheless, the existing research faces two major challenges: (1) a lack of quantitative metrics to assess CoT capabilities and (2) a dearth of guidance on optimizing CoT performance. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce a novel reasoning boundary framework (RBF) to address these challenges. To solve the lack of quantification, we first define a reasoning boundary (RB) to quantify the upper-bound of CoT and establish a combination law for RB, enabling a practical quantitative approach applicable to various real-world CoT tasks. To address the lack of optimization, we propose three categories of RBs. We further optimize these categories with combination laws focused on RB promotion and reasoning path optimization for CoT improvement. Through extensive experiments on 27 models and 5 tasks, the study validates the existence and rationality of the proposed framework. Furthermore, it explains the effectiveness of 10 CoT strategies and guides optimization from two perspectives. We hope this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of the boundaries and optimization strategies for reasoning in LLMs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/LightChen233/reasoning-boundary.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'natural_language_processing'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/47a165ca745dea00bf9fe4ba52210932fb6d1787.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\nchen2024unlocking,\ntitle={Unlocking the Capabilities of Thought: A Reasoning Boundary Framework to Quantify and Optimize Chain-of-Thought},\nauthor={Qiguang Chen and Libo Qin and Jiaqi WANG and Jingxuan Zhou and Wanxiang Che},\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=pC44UMwy2v}\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'chen|unlocking_the_capabilities_of_thought_a_reasoning_boundary_framework_to_quantify_and_optimize_chainofthought'}}, 'id': 'pC44UMwy2v', 'forum': 'pC44UMwy2v', 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16884/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16884/Authors'], 'number': 16884, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16884/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16884/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1715775218923, 'cdate': 1715775218923, 'tmdate': 1735191692619, 'mdate': 1735191692619, 'pdate': 1727288139994, 'odate': 1730873982165, 'version': 2}]"

Similar to how IRL trains a policy based on the reward function learned from expert demonstrations, we train (or fine-tune) a diffusion model using the log probability density estimated from training data. Since we employ an energy-based model (EBM) to represent the log density, our approach boils down to the joint training of a diffusion model and an EBM. Our IRL formulation, named Diffusion by Maximum Entropy IRL (DxMI), is a minimax problem that reaches equilibrium when both models converge to the data distribution. The entropy maximization plays a key role in DxMI, facilitating the exploration of the diffusion model and ensuring the convergence of the EBM. We also propose Diffusion by Dynamic Programming (DxDP), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion models, as a subroutine in DxMI. DxDP makes the diffusion model update in DxMI efficient by transforming the original problem into an optimal control formulation where value functions replace back-propagation in time. Our empirical studies show that diffusion models fine-tuned using DxMI can generate high-quality samples in as few as 4 and 10 steps.  Additionally, DxMI enables the training of an EBM without MCMC, stabilizing EBM training dynamics and enhancing anomaly detection performance.",Oral Session 3D: Natural Language Processing,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=V0oJaLqY4E,https://openreview.net/forum?id=V0oJaLqY4E,V0oJaLqY4E,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""The paper presents a novel and efficient methodology to improve diffusion generative models based on the formulation of an maximum entropy inverse RL problem.\n\nAll reviewers agree this paper presents a novel and significant contribution which is methodologically strong.\n\nDuring the author's rebuttal several points were discussed in detail.\nIn order of importance, the points revolved around:\n\n(1) The complexity and scalability of the algorithm.\n\n(2) The existence of theoretical guarantees / formal statements to ensure the stability of the objective function.\n\n(3) Additional comparative analysis to prior diffusion model acceleration methods with relative strengths and weaknesses.\n\n(4) The need for additional experiments.\n\n(5) A more comprehensive evaluation across different speed-quality trade-offs.\n\n(6) Misunderstandings related to the objective function, the need of a pre-trained diffusion model.\n\nThe rebuttal was convincing in clarifying all these points and no further discussion was required.\n\nI think this is a very strong paper which will have significant impact and thus recommend acceptance.\n\nWhile the primary focus of this work is to introduce a practical algorithm, I suggest incorporating the discussion regarding the above points as much as possible.""}}, 'id': 'Q5aZgU7kpJ', 'forum': 'V0oJaLqY4E', 'replyto': 'V0oJaLqY4E', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Program_Chairs'], 'nonreaders': [], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Program_Chairs'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13338/-/Decision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1727277670042, 'cdate': 1727277670042, 'tmdate': 1730886020108, 'mdate': 1730886020108, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for addressing my concerns.'}}, 'id': '7nkEfRREqZ', 'forum': 'V0oJaLqY4E', 'replyto': 'c93iCKXhoc', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13338/Reviewer_Nqik'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13338/Reviewer_Nqik'], 'number': 8, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13338/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723606009369, 'cdate': 1723606009369, 'tmdate': 1730890328180, 'mdate': 1730890328180, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'comment': {'value': 'Thanks for the detailed responses.

Theoretical analysis of DxMI**\n\n* We agree that theoretical analysis of our MaxEnt IRL problem would be very interesting. However, direct analysis of DxMI may be highly challenging because our EBM and diffusion model comprise deep neural networks.\n* Conducting theoretical analysis in a more restricted setting might be more feasible while still providing valuable insights. \n* To the best of our knowledge, there is not many theoretical results for MaxEnt IRL. Previous works [5,6] offered convergence guarantees for MaxEnt IRL in a discrete state-action space. While their results do not directly apply to DxMI due to algorithmic and other differences, their results suggest that similar analysis could be conducted on DxMI under suitable assumptions.\n* Please consider that the main focus of this paper is to present a practical algorithm that is empirically scalable and effective. We believe providing theoretical analysis that rationalizes the empirical results in the paper is an important future work. \n* We will add a paragraph describing the theoretical results from [5,6] in our Related Work section. We will also mention the difficulty of theoretical analysis in our limitations section.\n\n\n[5] Renard et al., Convergence of a model-free entropy-regularized inverse reinforcement learning algorithm, arxiv, 2024.\n\n[6] Zeng et al., Maximum-Likelihood Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Finite-Time Guarantees, NeurIPS 2022. \n\n**Q. Can the DxMI approach be extended to other families of generative models, e.g., bridge-matching diffusion models?**\n\n* Thanks for the interesting suggestion. We do believe the value-based learning presented in DxMI can be extended to other types of generative modeling problems, such as finding a bridge between distributions. \n\n**Q. How do you expect this approach to scale to more complex datasets or higher-dimensional spaces? Will the sample efficiency gains be more or less pronounced?**\n\n* Currently, we do not see a particular obstacle that prevents DxMI from scaling to larger datasets. We believe DxMI is at least as scalable as GANs, which have already demonstrated its feasiblity in a very high-dimensional datasets. As an empirical evidence, we will add LSUN Bedroom 256x256 experiments in the updated manuscript.\n\n**Q. How sensitive are the results to hyperparameters of DxMI/DxDP, such as the coefficient on the entropy term? What strategies did you use to tune these?**\n\n* DxMI is not sensitive to the entropy regularization coefficient $\\tau$, which can be safely set to 0.01 or 0.1. This insensitivity arises because the energy, which competes with the entropy, is regularized by the coefficient $\\gamma$ to maintain a narrow range of values close to zero. \n* We provide the guide for hyperparameter tuning in Appendix B. \n* Probably the most critical hyperparameter is learning rates, for which we assign a larger value for the energy and a smaller value for the diffusion model. This is included in Appendix B.\n\n\n\nThank you once more for your insightful feedback. We hope our responses have addressed your concerns.

What is the connection to KL-regularized RL fine-tuning, particularly in papers such as [1-4]?**\n\nThanks for pointing out an interesting connection. The sampler update step of DxMI is indeed closely related to KL-regularized RL.\n\n* We will augment our manuscript to discuss this connection in detail.\n    * We will add paragraphs dedicated to KL-regularized fine-tuning. In the paragraphs, we will cite the papers [1-4] and discuss them in detail.\n    * Please note that the current manuscript already mentions some works using KL-regularized RL, including [3], in the second paragraph of the Related Work section.\n* The sampler update objective of DxMI is a special case of KL-regularized RL. However, there are three key differences that makes DxMI distinct from existing KL-regularized RL fine-tuning methods.\n    * First, DxMI employs an uninformative reference policy, such as a Gaussian distribution (Eq. (7)). Due to this choice, DxMI can deviate from the pretraining model to find a better generation trajectory more suitable for small $T$.\n    * Second, DxMI employs a novel value-based algorithm for updating a diffusion model.\n    * Third, while most KL-regularized RL works assume that the reward function is known, DxMI simultaneously learns the reward from data.\n* BRAID [4] is particularly related to DxMI, as it also considers the problem of learning a reward from offline data. However, the reward is a separate random variable in [4], while in DxMI the reward is the log data density.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06279 Tang.

The comparison to prior diffusion model acceleration methods is somewhat limited.**\n\n* Our comparative discussion had to be limited due to page constraints. Currently, the first paragraph of Section 6 (""Faster Diffusion Models"") is dedicated to reviewing and comparing prior diffusion acceleration methods.\n* In the updated manuscript, we will enhance the ""Faster Diffusion Models"" section to highlight the key differences between DxMI and previous methods. Additionally, we will incorporate this comparison into the introduction and the experiments sections. The enhancements will include the following points:\n    * The key distinction between DxMI and existing diffusion acceleration methods is that DxMI does not use the intermediate states in the trajectory of a diffusion model. Most diffusion distillation methods focus on preserving or learning from these intermediate states. In contrast, DxMI directly aims to match the final state of a sampler to the data distribution. The promising performance of DxMI indicates that deviating from the original diffusion trajectory may be beneficial for sample quality when the generation has to be performed in a very few steps. Among existing methods, only SFT-PG employs a similar approach; however, DxMI outperforms SFT-PG by using dynamic programming instead of a policy gradient.\n\n\n**Q. A more comprehensive evaluation across different speed-quality tradeoffs would be essential.** \n\n* In the updated manuscript, we will include a figure demonstrating the speed-quality trade-off with more data points, such as $T$=2, 20, and 40.\n* Qualitatively, the best trade-off for DxMI is achieved in the mid-range of $T$, from 4 to 10.\n    * If $T$ is too small, the sampler is less capable, and the data processing inequality becomes less tight, making our MaxEnt regularization less effective.\n    * If $T$ is too large, the sampler\'s capability increases, but the value function learning becomes more challenging.\n\n**Q. More discussion of DxMI\'s relative strengths and weaknesses compared to other approaches would be essential.**\n\nWe will augment our discussion on strengths and weaknesses of DxMI in the update manuscript. Currently, some of weaknesses are mentioned in our Limitation section. Focusing on diffusion acceleration application, our strengths and weaknesses can be summarized as follows.\n* Strengths\n    * Unlike other diffusion distillation methods where the performance is bounded by the teacher model, in principle DxMI may achieve better sample quality than the pretrained model (see our CIFAR-10 case).\n    * The dynamic programming-based in DxMI is more effective than the policy gradient-based algorithm (e.g., SFT-PG).\n    * DxMI produces an EBM as a byproduct, which can be used in other applications such as anomaly detection or transfer learning.\n* Weaknesses \n    * When $T=1$, DxMI reduces to GAN, offering no additional advantage.\n    * DxMI does not offer the flexibility of using a different value of $T$ during the test time.\n\n----\nDue to the character limit, we will continue answering your question in the comment.'}}, 'id': '8k3Chcwoqd', 'forum': 'V0oJaLqY4E', 'replyto': 'S5VjlN4nUD', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13338/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13338/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13338/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722955940527, 'cdate': 1722955940527, 'tmdate': 1730883012639, 'mdate': 1730883012639, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""Dear Reviewer yjrf,\n\nWe appreicate your time and effort in reviewing our work. Here, we are happy to address your concerns and questions.\n\n**Q. Is the objective function stable?** \n\n> The objective in Eq (5) seems somewhat hard to be confident of, in the sense that given any $\\pi$ and $p$, the optimal $q$ could diverge away from p such that $KL(p||q) = KL(\\pi||q) \\gg 0$.  This could make it unstable as an iteration progresses, $\\pi$ will track q and then q can take another step further away from both p and $\\pi$ while being optimal for Eq (5). \n\nWe would like to clarify the critical misunderstandings regarding the objective function. \n\nLet us write our objective function as $L(q,\\pi)=KL(p \\parallel q) - KL(\\pi \\parallel q)$, where we aim to solve $\\min_q \\max_\\pi L(q,\\pi)$.\n\n* When $p$ and $\\pi$ are fixed and $p\\neq \\pi$, the optimal $q$ does not satify $KL(p \\parallel q) = KL(\\pi \\parallel q) \\gg 0$.\n    * It is a misunderstanding that our objective function $L(q,\\pi)$ has a minimum at 0, where $KL(p||q) = KL(\\pi||q)$.\n    * When $p\\neq \\pi$, the objective function can have a negative value. For example, setting $q=p$ makes the objective negative $L(p,\\pi)=-KL(p \\parallel \\pi)<0$. Therefore, $KL(p||q) = KL(\\pi||q)$ is not optimal for $q$, as there are other values of $q$ that achieve a lower objective function value.\n    * Thus, our objective function always keep $q$ closer to $p$ than to $\\pi$, not invoking the instability questioned in the review comment.\n\n\n**Q. Is learning possible when $\\pi$ is close to $p$?**\n> As another point, when initializing with a $\\pi$ that is close to p (e.g. in the pretrained model case), the optimal q does not look like it has to be close to either given the cancellation involved.\n\n> Moreover, since for the pre-trained checkpoints, π is likely close to p, the energy objective looks like it has minimal training signal.\n\n* When $p=\\pi\\neq q$, it is true that there is no learning signal for $q$. However, $p=\\pi\\neq q$ is not a Nash equilibrium, and learning is not terminated at this point.\n* When $p=\\pi\\neq q$, our objective function drives $\\pi$ away from $p$ to be close to $q$. After $\\pi$ becomes different from $p$, the learning signal for $q$ is generated. \n    * This behavior may be undesirable in practice. However, we are most interested in the case where the number of function evaluations is small ($T=4$ or $10$). With small $T$, the initial sample quality from $\\pi$ is very bad (Figure 1 (Right) of the manuscript), indicating that $p \\neq \\pi$.\n* As $p=\\pi\\neq q$ is not a Nash equilibrium of our objective function, an optimization algorithm, if done correctly, will eventually lead to the Nash equilibirum $p=q=\\pi$.\n\n\n**Q. DxMI still uses a diffusion model as a starting point.**\n> The authors introduce an elaborate scheme to do away with the score function denoising objective, but their experiments rely on pre-trained checkpoints that use the score function training to get these results so the final results are based on stacking the new methods on top of the original diffusion training.\n\n* DxMI is not meant to be a complete replacement for denoising objective. We will update our introduction to clarify that DxMI is a complementary training algorithm for diffusion models.\n* Please note that diffusion model pre-training is not always necessary for DxMI. In our 2D experiment and anomaly detection experiment, DxMI demonstrated its ability to train a sampler without pre-training.\n\n\n**Q. The proposed algorithm has multiple unstable procedures.**\n\n> The key proposal in Algorithm 1 has a multiple highly unstable procedures mixed together within each iteration -- e.g. the energy update in Line 5 and the TD bootstrap objective in line 7.\n\n* We understand the proposed algorithm can be seemingly complicated. \n    * To deal with the complexity, we will make our code public and provide model checkpoints. Also, we disclose our hyperparameters and suggest a hyperparameter selection strategy in Appendix B.\n* However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical or theoretical evidence of instability.\n    * The TD update and the energy update does not interfere with each other, as they operate on different inputs. Both updates are stable, as the energy update equation is regularized (coefficient $\\gamma$), and TD update is simply mean squared error minimization.\n* Empirically, we found the algorithm much more stable than MCMC-based EBM training algorithms, which occasionally diverge for no reason.\n* If you have a particular concern regarding the algorithm's stability, we are happy to discuss it.\n\n\n**Q. In Algorithm 1, Line 5, are the x and x_T completely independent samples with no relation to each other?**\n\n* You are correct that, in Algorithm 1, $\\mathbf{x}$ denotes a real data and $\\mathbf{x}_T$ indicates a sample from the diffusion model. We will make this point clear in the updated manuscript by adding a comment in Algorithm 1.\n\n\n\n\nThank you again for your constructive review. We believe there was a misunderstanding regarding our objective function, and we hope our response clarifies this issue. We kindly request that you reconsider the decision in light of our responses and update the score accordingly. We are also eager to address any additional concerns you may have.\n\nBest regards,  \nAuthors.""}}, 'id': '6QikE0XlQI', 'forum': 'V0oJaLqY4E', 'replyto': 'PKUoFy0mCu', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13338/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13338/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13338/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722954364381, 'cdate': 1722954364381, 'tmdate': 1730883012730, 'mdate': 1730883012730, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Dear Reviewer Nqik,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review our work.

Previous works [1,2] offered convergence guarantees for MaxEnt IRL in a discrete state-action space. While their results do not directly apply to DxMI due to algorithmic and other differences, their results suggest that a similar analysis could be conducted on DxMI under suitable assumptions.\n* Please consider that the main focus of this paper is to present a practical algorithm that is empirically scalable and effective.

All the comments and questions raised have been considered below. \n\n\n**Q. Complexity of Implementation**\n> The implementation of DxMI, particularly the joint training of diffusion models and EBMs, might be complex and require significant computational resources. \n\n* DxMI may seem complicated, but in fact its complexity is no larger than GANs and actor-critic RL methods.\n    * Particularly in image experiments, EBM is the only additional component over a diffusion model. EBM functions similarly to the discriminator of GAN. Furthermore, EBM used in DxMI is typically much smaller than the diffusion model, introducing minimal burden. For example, in our CIFAR-10 experiment (T=10), the EBM has 5M parameters while the diffusion model has 36M parameters. \n    * DxMI is significantly simpler than standard actor-critic RL, such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [1], which trains a value function and two Q functions simultaneously. On the contrary, DxMI does not require a Q function and trains only a single value function.\n\n[1] Haarnoja, Tuomas, et al. ""Soft actor-critic: Off-policy maximum entropy deep reinforcement learning with a stochastic actor."" ICML 2018. https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/haarnoja18b\n\n\n**Q. More Experiments**\n\n>The practical feasibility in various settings could be further elaborated.\n\n\n> The experiments, while promising, are somewhat limited in scope. More diverse and complex tasks could further validate the robustness and versatility of the proposed approach.\n\n> How do the authors envision the performance of DxMI in more complex generative tasks, such as high-resolution image generation or text-to-image synthesis?\n\n* The manuscript already includes experiments on a variety of tasks and data types, such as 2D density estimation, unconditional and conditional image generation, and anomaly detection using latent vectors. If you find any particular aspect of the experimental portfolio to be limited, please let us know.\n* To further demonstrate the scalability of DxMI, we will provide additional experimental results on LSUN Bedroom 256x256. DxMI (T=4) achieves competitive results (FID: 5.93, Recall: 0.477), whereas DDPM (T=1000) achieves FID: 4.89, Recall 0.45. We will augment our experiment section with the LSUN Bedroom experiment. This observation shows that DxMI is indeed scalable to high-dimensional data.\n* We believe that DxMI can be effectively applied to text-to-image synthesis. However, text-to-image synthesis typically requires a significant amount of computing resources (at least 25 A100 days) and involves numerous experimental conditions to explore (e.g., selecting text prompts). Therefore, we suggest this as an intriguing direction for future research.\n \n \n**Q. Comparative Analysis**\n> While the proposed methods show improvements, a more detailed comparative analysis with state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n* Please find that the current manuscript provides comparative analysis on Section 6 Related Work.\n* We will augment our comparative analysis by adding additional paragraphs in the introduction and sections that describe the proposed method.\n\n**Q. Average Training Time**\n\n> What is the average training time for models using DxMI compared to other generative model training techniques such as GANs or VAE-based approaches?\n\n* Our CIFAR-10 experiment takes less than 24 hours on two A100 GPUs, while our ImageNet 64 experiment takes approximately 48 hours on four A100 GPUs. The computational resources required for DxMI training are significantly lower compared to state-of-the-art GANs, which can take up to 48 hours on a Google TPU V3 Pod [2]. A TPU Pod consists of 1024 TPU chips, which are considerably more powerful than a few A100 GPUs. This difference is partly because DxMI can leverage a pre-trained diffusion model.\n\n[2] Brock et al. Large scale GAN training for high fidelity natural image synthesis. ICLR 2019. https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096\n\n**Q. Scalability**\n> Scalability: How scalable is the proposed DxMI approach when applied to larger datasets or models with significantly more parameters? Are there any anticipated bottlenecks?\n\n* For now, we do not observe any sign of bottleneck or inscalability. We believe DxMI is as scalable as GANs, since DxMI also leverages an EBM as a discriminator. GANs have already been shown to be scalable to very high-dimensional data [2].\n\n\nAgain, we thank you for providing valuable comments.

We thank the reviewers for their insightful feedback and constructive comments and for providing suggestions that would improve our paper.\n\nFirst of all, we are encouraged that the reviewers found the following points:\n\n(i) Our approach and formulation are novel, principled, and elegant in improving sample quality and inference time of a diffusion model.

(EhWr, Nqik, yjrf)   \n\n\nBased on the feedback from all reviewers, the most significant shared concerns or major points to address are as follows. \n\n**On theoretical analysis (Nqik, YBX1):** We agree with the reviewers that a theoretical analysis of our MaxEnt IRL problem would be valuable. To the best of our knowledge, there are few theoretical results available for MaxEnt IRL. Previous works [1,2] have provided convergence guarantees for MaxEnt IRL in a discrete state-action space with an infinite horizon. In contrast, our approach considers a continuous state-action space with a finite horizon. Additionally, there are algorithmic differences regarding the reward functions. Consequently, their results do not directly apply to DxMI. However, we believe a similar analysis could be performed on DxMI under appropriate assumptions and a simplified setting, particularly with linear reward functions and a tabular policy.\n\n[1] Renard et al., Convergence of a model-free entropy-regularized inverse reinforcement learning algorithm, arxiv, 2024.   \n\n[2] Zeng et al., Maximum-Likelihood Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Finite-Time Guarantees, NeurIPS 2022. \n\n\n**On scalability and complexity of the algorithm (EhWr, YBX1):** Because we formulate the problem using MaxEnt IRL, DxMI might initially seem complex. However, its complexity is comparable to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and actor-critic reinforcement learning methods. We believe that DxMI is as scalable as conventional diffusion models and GANs, which have already demonstrated scalability to very high-dimensional data. To demonstrate the scalability of DxMI, we run DxMI (T=4) on LSUN Bedroom 256x256 and achieve competitive results (FID: 5.93, Recall: 0.477), where DDPM (T=1000) achieves FID: 4.89, Recall 0.45. Additionally, we have not observed any signs of bottlenecks or scalability issues. For instance, DxMI is not particularly sensitive to the entropy regularization coefficient. We provide guidance for hyperparameter tuning in Appendix B. More specific answers can be found in individual comments.\n\n\nThe attached PDF provides examples of generation from DxMI on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64, along with samples from competitive baselines. \n\nWe hope the above answers some common questions from the reviewers.

(2)) and training objectives (Eqs. (3), (4), (5)) share very strong similarities/motivations to the concepts employed in existing KL-regularized RL-based fine-tuning papers (e.g., [1-4]). In particular, Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) in [2] serve precisely as the KL-based training objectives and the energy-based model, which involves sampling from unnormalized distributions. While I think the similarities might be just in terms of high-level methodologies and principles, it still becomes crucial for the authors to provide a thorough discussion highlighting the technical and methodological distinctions between this approach and the prior works in order to well-position the proposed method. For discussing the methodological relations/differences, I also recommend the authors carefully check [1] as this paper is written in a principled way, such that it becomes a good reference for understanding the methodologies.\n\n2. As mentioned, do you have any theoretical insight into the convergence properties of DxDP or approximation guarantees relating to the IRL and original objectives? Many IRL theories might be worth checking (references [1-4] also might be worth checking for this goal, probably). Even without providing rates/bounds, an intuitive discussion/remark on these points could further validate the approach.\n\n3. Can the DxMI approach be extended to other families of generative models, e.g., bridge-matching diffusion models, which are very similar to standard denoising diffusion models?

With the growing interest in architectures that process NNs, a recurring design principle has permeated the field: adhering to the permutation symmetries arising from the connectionist structure ofNNs. However, are these the sole symmetries present in NN parameterizations? Zooming into most practical activation functions (e.g. sine, ReLU, tanh) answers this question negatively and gives rise to intriguing new symmetries, which we collectively refer to as scaling symmetries, that is, non-zero scalar multiplications and divisions of weights and biases. In this work, we propose Scale Equivariant Graph MetaNetworks - ScaleGMNs, a framework that adapts the Graph Metanetwork (message-passing) paradigm by incorporating scaling symmetries and thus rendering neuron and edge representations equivariant to valid scalings. We introduce novel building blocks, of independent technical interest, that allow for equivariance or invariance with respect to individual scalar multipliers or their product and use them in all components of ScaleGMN. Furthermore, we prove that, under certain expressivity conditions, ScaleGMN can simulate the forward and backward pass of any input feedforward neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method advances the state-of-the-art performance for several datasets and activation functions, highlighting the power of scaling symmetries as an inductive bias for NN processing.

AXwX** *pinpoints that these improvements are achieved with built-in equivariance alone and without having to resort to additional practical tricks* (AXwX: ""without many of the unfair or expensive tricks that others use! [...] That ScaleGMN can beat the prior methods without these tricks is very impressive. [...] ScaleGMN does not need random Fourier features or data augmentations"")\n\n## Rebuttal Summary\n\n### Equivariant tasks\nReviewers AXwX, x2pG, ugM4 correctly mention the need for an equivariant task. To that end, we evaluate on **INR editing**. Following [2], we select the MNIST-INR dataset and evaluate our method. Again, no additional tricks or augmentations were used. \n\n**Results**. (Table 1) Bidirectional *ScaleGMN-B* achieves an MSE test loss ($10^{-2}$) equal to $1.89$, **surpassing all baselines**, outperforming even the *NG-GNN baseline with 64 probe features*. Note that the performance gap between the bidirectional and the forward model (which achieves a loss of $2.56$) is expected for equivariant tasks: in this case we are required to compute representations for every graph node, yet, in the forward variant, the earlier the layer of the node, the less information it receives. Similarly, our baselines are either bidirectional (NG-GNN [2]) or non-local (DWS [3], NFN [1]).\n\n### Heterogeneous activation functions\nReviewer x2pG  pointed to heterogeneous activation functions. *In principle, our method does not impose any limitations regarding their homogeneity*. \n\n**Results**. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-GS, **ScaleGMN demonstrates superior performance** compared to the baselines, *significantly surpassing the next best model*. (Table 4)\n\n### Scaling data augmentations\nReviewer ugM4 proposed baselining with a permutation-equivariant-only model combined with random scaling augmentations.\n\n**Results.** (Table 3)\n* **Sign symmetries**: We augment w/  sign flips **independently** (probability 0.5). This surpasses the original baselines, but **not ScaleGMN and ScaleGMN-B.**\n* **Positive-scale symmetries**: We sample positive scalars  (NB: **continuous and unbounded distribution**), but observe performance deterioration compared to the original baselines.\n\n### More complex architectures\nWe acknowledge that experimenting with diverse architectures would strengthen our contributions. However, there are two reasons why this was not possible in the current work. First, the characterisation of scaling symmetries holds for MLPs and can be extended to CNNs. However, extending it to other architectures requires further efforts and is therefore more appropriate to be considered in future work. \n\nSecond, weight-space learning is currently missing curated benchmarks of complex architectures. Lim et al. [4] and Zhou et al. [5] experiment with diverse architectures, using private datasets. Small DNN Zoo [6] and ModelZoos [7] contain trained CNNs of fixed architectures. Finally, the diverse CNN Wild Park [2] was only made public a few days ago. *Keeping in mind that processing such networks is not among our main contributions*, we opted to align with the previous works on metanetworks and selected the datasets used in [1], [2].\n\n### Exposition/writing style\nWe thank the reviewers x2pG and ugM4 for their suggestions. We allocated a good portion of the paper to problem formulation and background, as the topic of weight space learning is relatively new. The characterisation of scaling symmetries is also recent and has not yet gathered significant attention. Consequently, we opted for a smooth and detailed introduction before delving into our contributions to make our work self-sufficient.'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/775ec4d3f602cff1f7789f2b83c7efb41dcf3422.pdf'}}, 'id': 'jukDQ6ldQE', 'forum': '8Fxqn1tZM1', 'replyto': '8Fxqn1tZM1', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12488/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12488/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12488/-/Author_Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722998329546, 'cdate': 1722998329546, 'tmdate': 1730888453390, 'mdate': 1730888453390, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': 'Additional responses to reviewer Reviewer ugM4'}, 'comment': {'value': '>*Weakness 1.

Scaling data augmentations*\n\nAn effective method to get such augmentations is to sample scaling matrices for every training datapoint  - diagonal sign matrices for sign and diagonal positive scaling matrices for positive scale symmetries, respectively. Subsequently, we transform the input network parameters by applying the matrices to the hidden layers. (like in Eq.3 in our paper, but without the permutation matrices)\n\nThe way to perform this random sampling, however, is not straightforward and we have to deal the two cases separately.\n\n**Sign symmetries**: Since the diagonal sign matrices are of the form $\\mathbf{Q} = \\text{diag}(q_1 , \\dots , q_d ), q_i = ±1$, we sample each element of the matrix **independently and uniformly at random with probability 0.5**. We observe that augmenting the training set leads consistently to better results when compared to the original baselines. **None of these methods however achieved results on par with ScaleGMN and ScaleGMN-B.** (Table 3 in the PDF)\n    \n**Positive-scale symmetries**: The diagonal positive scaling matrices are of the form: $\\mathbf{Q} = \\text{diag}(q_1 , \\dots , q_d ), q_i \\in (0, +\\infty)$. Hence, we have to sample from a **continuous and unbounded distribution** making the augmentation strategy much more difficult to design. Consulting the plots in the appendix A.5, we opted for an exponential distribution and experiment with the coefficient $\\lambda$. Nevertheless, regardless of the distribution choice we cannot guarantee that the augmentations will be sufficient, due to the lack of upper bound. We observe that we were not able to surpass the original baselines, which indicates that designing an effective baseline of this type is not straightforward. (Table 3 in the PDF)\n\nWe thank the reviewer for proposing this important baseline.\n    \n### Questions\n\n>*Question 1. Canon/symm mappings for all activation functions.*\n\nIn general, we cannot guarantee that these mappings are easy to construct for *any* activation function, since it is currently unknown if we can provide a general characterisation of the possible symmetries that may arise. Our results  extend to all positively homogeneous activations, $\\sigma(\\lambda x) = \\lambda \\sigma(x), \\lambda > 0$, and all odd ones, $\\sigma(-x) = - \\sigma(x)$. We refer the reviewer to Table 1 of [1], where we can see that LeakyReLU also falls in the first category. Regarding polynomial activations, which demonstrate *non-zero scaling symmetries*, one option would be: (1) norm division to canonicalise scale, and (2) sign symm/canon as discussed in the main paper (and the rebuttal). The above, cover a fairly broad spectrum of common activation functions.\n    \n    \n>*Question 2. Forward vs Bidirectional and Augmented CIFAR-10.*\n\nIndeed, in most invariant tasks, the bidirectional variant does not provide significant advantages. This is inline with what has been observed in [2], where a forward variant is also sufficient. We speculate that this might be related to the fact that the tasks we considered may be solved by simulating the forward pass of the input NN alone. Given that the forward pass can be expressed by the forward variant alone, this might provide an explanation for its efficacy on the invariant tasks we considered. The significance of the bidirectional variant is highlighted mostly on  *equivariant* tasks, where ScaleGMN-B significantly outperforms the forward variant. Please refer to the global response, where we report our results on INR-editing and discuss the limitations of the forward variant on the equivariant tasks.\n\nPlease refer to our response to Question 4 of reviewer x2pG for ScaleGMN-B on the Augmented CIFAR-10.\n\n\n>*Question 4. Trainable parameters: GMN vs ScaleGMN(-B)?*\n\nGoing from a GMN model to ScaleGMN requires adapting the MSG and UPD functions to be scale equivariant, leading to more learnable parameters, as opposed to using plain MLPs. Another design choice of ScaleGMN that introduces more parameters is using different MLPs for the I/O nodes (Appendix A.1.4).\n\nPlease refer to Table 2, where we report the training and inference runtimes.\n\n\n>*Question 5. Did you use any augmentation on the input NNs?*\n*No, we do not use any augmentation on the input NNs.*\n\nAugmentations are only used for the dataset ""Augmented CIFAR-10"", where we follow the augmentation procedure from [3] for comparison reasons with the rest of the baselines. ScaleGMN and ScaleGMN-B rely solely on the original training dataset and on built-in equivariance/invariance.\n\n>*Question 6. Are there any limitations on the choice of activations of the ScaleGMN network?*\n\n*Importantly, our method does **not** impose any limitations on the choice of the activation functions.*\n\nWe are able to select any activation, because these are only applied within the MLPs of the invariant modules.  As discussed in Section 5 of our paper, the MLPs (equipped with non-linearities) are only applied after the canon/symm function. In case one chose to place activations in a different computational part of ScaleGMN, this would indeed limit their options so as not to compromise scale equivariance. However, this is not the case in our method. We thank the reviewer for noticing this important detail.\n     \n---\n[1] Godfrey, Charles, et al.

Writing Style*\n\nWe thank the reviewer for their suggestions. Please refer to the global response about the writing pace and style.\n\n>*Weakness 2. Equivariant tasks*\n\nTo evaluate the performance of our method on tasks that require permutation and scale equivariance, we selected the task of INR editing. Please refer to our global response and to Table 1 of the attached PDF. In summary, the bidirectional variant, ScaleGMN-B, surpasses all baseline metanetworks, including GNNs using additional information (probe features)\n    \n>*Weakness 3. Processing diverse and complex architectures*\n\nPlease refer to our global response regarding the experiments on larger and more complex architectures.\n\n### Questions\n>*Question 1.  DWS and INR2VEC on CIFAR-10*\n\n\nIn Table 1 of our paper we include, together with our results, all the baselines from the literature. For the CIFAR-10 dataset we did not include any experiments with DWS and INR2VEC, as they were not included in [1], where the task was proposed. However, we have now run both experiments using the **DWS** model, which achieved $34.45 \\pm 0.42$ on CIFAR-10 and $41.27 \\pm 0.026$ on Augmented CIFAR-10. As expected, these results are on par with the rest of the permutation equivariant models. \n\nRegarding INR2VEC [2], we have not reimplemented it and tested on the CIFAR-10 dataset - we only used results present in the literature. However, INR2VEC demonstrated significantly worse performance than DWS [3] and NFN [1] on the task of INR classification, as can be found in the literature, and therefore testing it on extra data will probably offer limited added value, as it. Nevertheless, we plan to also include this baseline in an updated version.\n\n\n>*Question 2. Performance (runtime) degradation between ScaleGMN and ScaleGMNB and complexity*\n\n\nThe reviewer here makes a correct comment regarding the complexity of the forward (ScaleGMN) and the bidirectional variant (ScaleGMN-B) of our method. In the latter case, we add *backward edges* to our graph and introduce a *backward message function* to discern the two message directions. Subsequently, we  concatenate the outputs of the two message functions and apply the UPD function. Consequently, the additional complexity of ScaleGMN-B is introduced solely by the extra message function, with a complexity of $O(E)$. Given that ScaleGMN has the complexity of a standard GNN model $O(V+E)$, the final complexity of ScaleGMN-B is $O(V+2E)$. \n\nTo measure the differences regarding the runtime performance, we conduct a controlled experiment on the F-MNIST dataset. We observe that ScaleGMN-B only needs $6.83$ more seconds per epoch, when compared to ScaleGMN. Regarding the inference time this difference is $0,0132$ seconds per datapoint. Please refer to our response to reviewer ugM4 as well as to Table 2 in the PDF within our global response for the complete results.\n\n\n>*Question 3. Heterogeneous activation functions.*\n\n\nThis is an interesting question and of importance to ensure the generality of our method. *In principle, our method does not impose any limitations regarding the homogeneity of the activation functions of the input neural networks*. To see this, observe that the only part of the metanetwork that gets affected by the symmetry induced by the activation function, is the *symmetrisation/canonicalisation* function. In other words, all the modules of the metanetwork can be reused for any input NN with arbitrary activations, as long as the datapoints are symmetrised/canonicalised accordingly. \n\n**Experiments**. Experimentally, we opted to split the datasets into two subsets (one with ReLU Nets and one with tanh Nets). This choice was made solely to evaluate our method separately for each type of symmetry and assess the different invariant methods that we employed for each case. Following, the reviewer\'s suggestion, we extend our evaluation to heterogeneous activation functions (a dataset containing both ReLU and tanh Nets). We conducted epxeriments on the CIFAR-10-GS dataset and report the results on Table 4 in the attached PDF of our global response. The baselines are reported as in [4]. **Interestingly, we observe that ScaleGMN demonstrates superior performance compared to the previous baselines, significantly exceeding the performance of the next best model.** We thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment - we will include this in the updated version of the manuscript.\n    \n\n>*Question 4. The results of ScaleGMN-B on Augmented CIFAR-10.*\n\n\nThis was indeed a confusing result, which was merely due to suboptimal hyperparameter search. Unfortunately, due to the large size of this dataset ($20$ times larger than ""CIFAR-10"") and limited computational resources, the hyperparameter search for the ScaleGMN-B on the Augmented CIFAR-10 dataset had not finished by the time of the submission. Hence, the reported result does not reflect the real performance of the model. We completed the hyperparameter search post-submission, and achieved accuracy equal to **$56.95 \\pm 0.57$** - this result follows the same pattern with the rest of the datasets.\n\n\n>*Question 5. Figure of ScaleGMN and ScaleGMNB.*\n\nWe thank the reviewer for suggesting to include a figure depicting our architectures. We will consider designing one and including it in an updated version of the manuscript.\n\n---\n[1] Zhou, Allan, et al. ""Permutation equivariant neural functionals.""

It would be interesting to see how ScaleGMNs perform on different tasks, especially an equivariant task (rather than just invariant tasks) such as INR editing.*\n\n\nMetanetworks can indeed find interesting applications that require our model to be permutation and scale equivariant.

The equation on Page 6 should probably have or something similar as its arguments, instead of (because if the are just general MLPs as you say right after the equation, then this is not scale invariant).*\n\nThank you for spotting this. Indeed, there is a typo in the definition of ScaleInv (below L265). The arguments of the function $\\rho^k$ (universal approximators - MLPs) should have been $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_i$ instead of $\\mathbf{x}_i$, where $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_i$ are explained later in the text (L277) and are the outputs of a canonicalisation or a symmetrisation function, i.e. $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_i = \\text{canon}(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ or $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_i = \\text{symm}(\\mathbf{x}_i)$, which ensures invariance. We will fix this in an updated version of the manuscript.\n\n---\n\n>*Weakness 3.

In Ma et al. 2023 and Ma et al. 2024, algorithms are given for canonicalizing with respect to the sign group, for use on inputs to a neural network.*\n\nWe are grateful to the reviewer for bringing up these two recent references that deal with sign canonicalisation - we were not aware of these works and, indeed, they are useful for our setup. Given the fact that symmetrisation introduces additional parameters (i.e. the internal MLP, see L276), we are interested in conducting experiments in the future with the proposed canonicalisation method, so as to examine if similar performance can be achieved with a reduced parameter count. Additionally, we will update our text accordingly to complement our discussion with this missing point.\n\n\n### Questions\n\n>*Question 1. Do you have a way to handle translation symmetries in nonlinearities?*\n\n\nTranslation symmetries (such as those induced  by the softmax activation)  are an important next step in this research direction. Our method currently does not handle this case. A potentially straightforward modification might be to follow the same rationale with scale equivariant networks: first, define a translation invariant module via canonicalisation and second, use it to achieve equivariace (e.g.  translate the input by the output of the invariant module). For example, for symmetries of the form $\\mathbf{x}’ =  \\mathbf{x} + a$, where $a$ is a scalar, we can canonicalise as follows  $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} =  \\mathbf{x} - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i $. \n\nWe believe that characterizing even more nonlinearities (or families of them) and designing the respective invariant modules, is a prosperous future work towards implementing a unified framework able to handle various types of networks.'}}, 'id': 'iXIkkSUmuH', 'forum': '8Fxqn1tZM1', 'replyto': 'Y73sOp5AU6', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12488/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12488/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12488/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722976692618, 'cdate': 1722976692618, 'tmdate': 1730882815585, 'mdate': 1730882815585, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': ""This work develops new GNN-based metanetworks that are equivariant to scaling symmetries induced by nonlinearities in input neural networks.

Great writing. Nice introduction and related work, as well as good setup and notation in Section 3.\n2. Nice theoretical results. That ScaleGMN is can express the forward and backward pass is a good way to check that its expressive power is not overly limited when adding the additional scaling equivariances. Also, there is an interesting discussion in Appendix A.2 on equivariant for bidirectional ScaleGMNs.\n3. Large empirical improvements, especially on INR classification (without many of the unfair or expensive tricks that others use!), with ScaleGMN. I say some previous tricks are ""unfair"" because, for instance, random probe features of Kofinas et al. as used on INRs can essentially be used to see the input image pixels, and hence the prediction task is also taking in the image as well as the INR representing it. That ScaleGMN can beat the prior methods without these tricks is very impressive.\n4. Several other interesting empirical findings. These include the fact that ScaleGMN does not need random Fourier features or data augmentations, and that the bidirectional version can vary in performance (sometimes drastically as in augmented CIFAR-10).'}, 'weaknesses': {'value': '1.

With the growing interest in architectures that process NNs, a recurring design principle has permeated the field: adhering to the permutation symmetries arising from the connectionist structure of\nNNs. However, are these the sole symmetries present in NN parameterizations? Zooming into most practical activation functions (e.g. sine, ReLU, tanh) answers this question negatively and gives rise to intriguing new symmetries, which we collectively refer to as scaling symmetries, that is, non-zero scalar multiplications and divisions of weights and biases. In this work, we propose Scale Equivariant Graph MetaNetworks - ScaleGMNs, a framework that adapts the Graph Metanetwork (message-passing) paradigm by incorporating scaling symmetries and thus rendering neuron and edge representations equivariant to valid scalings. We introduce novel building blocks, of independent technical interest, that allow for equivariance or invariance with respect to individual scalar multipliers or their product and use them in all components of ScaleGMN. Furthermore, we prove that, under certain expressivity conditions, ScaleGMN can simulate the forward and backward pass of any input feedforward neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method advances the state-of-the-art performance for several datasets and activation functions, highlighting the power of scaling symmetries as an inductive bias for NN processing.

We are encouraged that the reviewers appreciate the **sound technology** (6qWk, cEzg), **well-organized writing** (bix9, 6qWk, cEzg), **certain influence** (bix9, 6qWk, cEzg), **clear motivation** (bix9, 6qWk, cEzg), and **excellent experimental performance** (bix9, G1Ro, 6qWk, cEzg). All suggestions were seriously considered and we will carefully revise the manuscript. We address each reviewer in individual comments.\n\n## Motivation and Novelty.\nThe paper introduces the first end-to-end joint training paradigm in the MFD field, as acknowledged by reviewer comments: reviewer cEzg finds the idea of simultaneous learning intriguing and reasonable, reviewer 6qWk notes it’s the first attempt at simultaneous single-stage training, and reviewer G1Ro acknowledges the novel approach presented in the paper.\n\nCurrent research aims to enhance image informativeness and detection performance through joint learning algorithms integrating MF and OD networks. However, existing non-end-to-end optimization methods involve cumbersome multiple steps that reduce training efficiency. Therefore, we propose E2E-MFD as the first end-to-end joint training paradigm in the MFD field. E2E-MFD facilitates interaction between intrinsic features from both domains through a streamlined, one-stage process. Our approach includes dedicated module design, such as the novel ORPPT and CFDP mechanism, to effectively balance and integrate fine-grained details with semantic information at pixel and object levels. Additionally, we found the gradient conflict problem in synchronous training for the first time and designed GMTA  to optimize task dominance and resolve conflicting gradients. Comprehensive experiments show that E2E-MFD is superior to the existing pipeline.\n\n## Experimental Results.\nAccording to the suggestions of **reviewer bix9**, we have added the ablation experiments and detailed information is available in the **pdf document**:\n\nA study of fluctuations in single category detection accuracy M3FD dataset is shown **Table R.1**. We prove that it is common to observe fluctuations in detection accuracy within a single category on the M3FD dataset. Despite fluctuations, our algorithm significantly outperforms others in overall mAP. \n\nTable R.1: A study of fluctuations in single category detection accuracy.\n\n| Method  | People | Car  | Bus  | Motorcycle | Lamp | Truck | $ \\text{mAP} _ {50} $ | $ \\text{mAP} _ {50:95} $ |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| U2Fusion |    47.5    |   69.3   | 73.0     |      43.7      | 44.9     | 62.2      |          86.9           |            56.8            |\n| U2Fusion |    47.7    |   **70.1**   | 73.2     |      43.2      | 44.6     | 63.9      |          87.1           |            57.1            |\n| E2E-MFD |    **60.1**    |   69.5   |  **81.4**     |      **52.2**      |  **47.6**    |  **72.2**      |          **91.8**           |            **63.8**            |\n\n\nThe GMTA is performed approximately every $n$ iteration (gradient update), focusing on balancing the independence and coherence of various tasks. **Table R.2** presents the ablation analysis of the $n$ parameter of GMTA. Decreasing $n$ initially disrupts task optimization due to frequent alignment, while increasing $n$ becomes crucial when the network determines task optimization directions. However, excessively large $n$ leads to significant deviations in task paths, making alignment more challenging and negatively impacting performance. \n\nTable R.2: Ablation studies of the iteration parameter $n$.\n\n| $n$  | EN | MI  | VIF | $\\text{mAP} _ {50}$ | $\\text{mAP} _ {50:95}$ |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| 500  | 6.17 | 15.05 | 1.58 | 90.93 | 62.93   |\n| 1000 | **6.36**  | **15.47**  | **1.65**  | **91.80**  | **63.83** |\n| 1500 | 6.24 | 15.08 | 1.62 | 91.10 | 63.16    |\n| 2000 | 6.13 | 14.69 | 1.45 | 90.35 | 62.75  |\n\nWe conducted ablation experiments on CFDP in **Table R.3**, investigating its inclusion and the number of proposed boxes.

As reviewer cEzg commented, ""The idea of simultaneously learning image fusion (MF) and object detection (OD) tasks to mutually benefit each other is intriguing and reasonable."" **It is important to note that the contribution of this paper lies in introducing the first end-to-end joint training paradigm in the fusion detection field.** In current research, joint learning algorithms are an emerging hotspot, leveraging fusion networks and object detection synergies to enhance image informativeness and improve detection performance. However, **existing** optimization methods are typically **non-end-to-end**, relying on multiple steps, as shown in Figure 1. These approaches are cumbersome and reduce training efficiency. Therefore, we propose the **first end-to-end synchronous joint optimization** algorithm, E2E-MFD, which facilitates interaction between intrinsic features from both domains through synchronous joint optimization, enabling a **streamlined, one-stage process**.\n\nMoreover, our end-to-end solution does not merely concatenate two tasks (modules) but involves dedicated module design. To harmonize **fine-grained details** with **semantic information**, we introduce the novel concept of an Object-Region-Pixel Phylogenetic Tree (ORPPT) coupled with a coarse-to-fine diffusion processing (CFDP) mechanism. Additionally, we find that the MF and OD tasks have naturally distinct optimization objectives. MF primarily focuses on capturing pixel-level relationships between image pairs, while OD integrates object semantics within diverse scene contexts. Therefore, there exists an **inherent optimization barrier** between these two tasks. To address this, we especially introduce the concept of **gradient alignment** in the multi-task learning field, proposing GMTA to align gradients for o**ptimizing task dominance and resolving conflicting gradients** in the end-to-end joint training process. As you mentioned, we ultimately propose a novel approach to learning image fusion and objection detection synchronously and jointly. We are the first to innovatively **integrate image fusion and object detection** into a single-stage, end-to-end framework, achieving **SOTA results** on multiple datasets.\n\n**A2**: As pointed out by reviewer 6qWk, “This paper presents the first attempt to achieve simultaneous single-stage training of image fusion and object detection, and the results appear very promising. Inspired by multitask learning, the GMTA method is introduced to reasonably balance the loss functions, thereby converging the fusion detection weights to optimal points.” As discussed in A1, previous SOTA methods relied on non-end-to-end optimization approaches, dividing joint training into multiple steps, which led to complexity during training. These methods excessively emphasized leveraging OD information for MF enhancement, complicating parameter balancing and making them susceptible to local optima of individual tasks. **Therefore, achieving a unified feature set that simultaneously satisfies the characteristics of each task through end-to-end training remains a formidable challenge.** This paper introduces E2E-MFD, an end-to-end multimodal fusion detection algorithm. E2E-MFD aims to seamlessly integrate detailed image fusion and object detection from coarse to fine levels. We introduce the gradient alignment concept from the multi-task learning domain, aiming to eliminate conflicting gradients between object detection and multimodal fusion tasks through the design of GMTA optimization mode. **By facilitating synchronous joint optimization and fostering interaction between intrinsic features from both tasks, E2E-MFD achieves a streamlined single-stage process in an end-to-end manner.** In addition, reviewers bix9, 6qWk, and cEzg both acknowledged our writing presentation. We will strive to improve our writing skills to the best of our ability. Please help us identify which diagrams have caused you confusion. We will make every effort to revise the diagrams and provide comprehensive explanations.\n\n**A3**: Our goal is to explore an end-to-end joint training approach. Thank you for recognizing the **novelty** of the **design of node1 and node2**. In this framework, Node 1 serves the object detection task, while Node 2 acts as a module for MF tasks, with personalized settings harnessing the respective roles of the nodes. As you mentioned, one of our primary contributions is introducing **an end-to-end synchronous training paradigm** for multimodal fusion detection, where synchronized joint optimization allows both tasks to complement each other synergistically. This collaboration enables MF to generate richer, more informative images, enhancing the performance of OD, which in turn provides valuable semantic insights to MF for accurate localization and identification of objects within scenes. However, it is crucial to address the issue of **gradient conflicts** in the joint optimization of fusion and detection tasks, known as task consistency. This challenge, though a common concern in multitask learning, is effectively tackled for the **first time** in the realm of **multimodal fusion detection** through end-to-end training. As reviewer cEzg noted, “An end-to-end fusion detection algorithm is proposed, effectively avoiding the local optimum problem encountered in multi-stage training models.”\n\nAdditionally, it should be noted that the training approach of Metafusion is not end-to-end. Our algorithm essentially represents an advanced end-to-end version of “metafusion,” (i.e., a non-end-to-end image fusion method) taken to its ultimate level of refinement.'}}, 'id': '9O2iHOQTFa', 'forum': '47loYmzxep', 'replyto': 'TkTQ4t26Nl', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1054/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1054/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1054/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722838324559, 'cdate': 1722838324559, 'tmdate': 1730880491606, 'mdate': 1730880491606, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': '# Reviewer bix9\nThanks for your comments.\n\n**A1:** This is a common default setting in the field such as ""CVPR23 MetaFusion"".

Thus, the feature learning constraint $\\mathcal{S}(\\boldsymbol{ \\theta}^{\\star})$ can be defined as the following optimization to eliminate training instability:\n$$ \\min _{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{G}}}\\|\\boldsymbol{G}-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{G}}\\|_F^2 \\quad \\text { s.t. }\\kappa(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{G}})=1 \\iff \\min _{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{G}}}\\|\\boldsymbol{G}-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{G}}\\|_F^2 \\quad \\text { s.t. }\\hat{\\boldsymbol{G}}^{\\top} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{G}}=\\boldsymbol{I}.$$\n\nThe problem can be treated as a Procrustes problem and can be solved by performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) to $\\boldsymbol{G}$ ($\\boldsymbol{G}=\\boldsymbol{U} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{V}^\\top$) and rescaling singular values corresponding to principal components so that they are equal to the smallest singular value:\n$$\n\t\t\\hat{\\boldsymbol{G}}=\\sigma \\boldsymbol{U} \\boldsymbol{V}^{\\top}=\\sigma \\boldsymbol{G} \\boldsymbol{V} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\boldsymbol{V}^\\top,\n$$\nwhere, \n$$(\\boldsymbol{V}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda})= eigh(\\boldsymbol{G}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{G}),$$\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} = diag(\\sqrt{1/\\lambda_{max}},\\sqrt{1/\\lambda_{min}}).$$\n$eigh$ finds eigenvectors $\\boldsymbol{V}$ and eigenvalues $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$, with $diag$ representing a diagonal matrix. $\\lambda_{max}$ and $\\lambda_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$. The stability criterion, defined by the condition number, sets a linear system to an arbitrary position scale. To resolve this ambiguity, we select the largest scale ensuring convergence to the optimum, corresponding to the minimal singular value of the initial gradient matrix:\n$$\\sigma=\\sigma_{\\min }(\\boldsymbol{G})=\\sqrt{\\lambda_{min}}.$$\n\n**A5:** The GMTA process operates during the computation and updating stages of two gradients, approximately every $n$ iteration (gradient update), to balance the independence and coherence of various tasks. Tab. R.2 presents the ablation analysis of the $n$ parameter. Detail analysis is in **Experiment Results part of Global Author Rebuttal**.\n\n**A6:** We have added ablation experiments on CFDP, involving whether to use CFDP and the number of proposed boxes, as shown in Tab. R.3. Detail analysis is in **Experiment Results part of Global Author Rebuttal**.\n\n**A7:** The paper designs the first end-to-end joint training paradigm in MFD. E2E-MFD enhances interaction between intrinsic features through synchronous joint optimization, streamlining the process. Our solution goes beyond task concatenation, incorporating dedicated module design. Inspired by a phylogenetic tree analogy, we employ an ORPPT to extract features across multiple region scales. By utilizing PFMM and $L$ RFRM branches, we capture various granularities from coarse to fine. Tab. 5 validates our approach, while Fig. 6 underscores the importance of effectively integrating pixel-level and object-level details. \n\nMF primarily focuses on pixel-level relationships between image pairs, while OD integrates object semantics within diverse scene contexts. This inherent optimization barrier between the tasks necessitates a solution. We propose GMTA, a gradient alignment concept within the multi-task learning framework, to optimize task dominance and resolve conflicting gradients in end-to-end joint training. Results in Tab. 4 demonstrate that GMTA, with shared weights, yields superior performance. Comparison with other methods in Tab. 6 further validates our approach. Fig. 5 illustrates how GMTA balances shared parameters between MF and OD, effectively mitigating gradient dominance and conflict.\n\n**A8:** In Tab. R.4, three recent fusion SOTA methods (CVPR2024 SHIP, PR2024 CFNet, and PR2024 DSFusion) and three evaluation metrics (Qabf, PSNR, and SSIM) are incorporated to valid effectiveness of our method.

To address this problem, most existing methods attempt to find proper valid instrumental variables (IVs) for the target causal effect by expert knowledge or by assuming that the causal model is a one-directional MR model. As such, in this paper, we first theoretically investigate the identification of the bi-directional MR from observational data. In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which valid IV sets are correctly identified such that the bi-directional MR model is identifiable, including the causal directions of a pair of phenotypes (i.e., the treatment and outcome).Moreover, based on the identification theory, we develop a cluster fusion-like method to discover valid IV sets and estimate the causal effects of interest.We theoretically demonstrate the correctness of the proposed algorithm.Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method for estimating causal effects in both one-directional and bi-directional MR models.","Oral Session 5B: Graph Neural Networks, Causal Inference",https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S2P6KPLtm8,https://openreview.net/forum?id=S2P6KPLtm8,S2P6KPLtm8,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'The paper addresses the challenging problem of causal effect estimation from observational data in Mendelian randomization (MR).

Please see below the summarized main concerns.\n\n# Experiments\nFollowing the suggestions from reviewers, we provide additional results on two **real-world datasets** to further validate the effectiveness of our method and enhance our paper. One is derived from a study on the bi-directional causal relationships between obesity and Vitamin D Status [1], while the other one from an empirical study on the impact of colonial history on the economic development of various regions [2]. Experimental results on both datasets revealed that our method could find valid IVs as well as obtain causal effects, which are consistent with those findings from existing literature.\n\nMoreover, we performed additional **synthetic experiments** to validate the efficacy of our method, with **results shown in the supplemented PDF**.\n\n# Assumptions \nFollowing the suggestions from reviewers, we provide in-depth discussion and exploration of the necessity of assumptions, to strengthen the paper.\n\n- Compared with existing methods that constrain the number of valid IVs to be larger than 2, **Assumption 1** of our method allows the number of valid IVs to equal 2 for the bi-directional model, which is much milder. If it is violated, our method as well as other mentioned methods would fail to identify a valid IV set theoretically.\n\n- Note that **Assumption 2** is satisfied mostly in reality as the set of conditions that meet this assumption occupies a very small portion of the entire space, making it very demanding to violate.\n\n- To derive the full identifiability of valid IVs in our bi-directional MR model, i.e., determining which causal direction the IV set is related to, we further introduce **Assumption 3**. If it is violated, we may fail to determine the causal direction for the identified IV set. \n\n- **Linearity assumption**. Identifying instrumental variables in bidirectional MR, both theoretically and practically, within the one-sample MR framework is a desirable but challenging research topic. We employed the linearity assumption to entail the theoretical identifiability of the bi-directional MR model, while the linearity model could enjoy some remarkable characteristics. \n\nWe sincerely thank the reviewers and the AC for their time and thoughtful feedback on our paper.

Please see examples in real-world experiments.\n- Honestly, it is hard to test **Assumptions 2 or 3** directly in real life, since usually we cannot obtain the ground truths of causal effects between any two variables, including latent confounders. It should be noted that Assumption 2 is satisfied mostly in reality as the set of conditions that meet this assumption occupies a very small portion of the entire space, making it very demanding to violate. If Assumption 3 is violated, we may fail to determine the causal direction for the identified IV set. \n\n>**W2.** real-world datasets?\n\nWe additionally evaluated our method on two real-world datasets. One is derived from a study on the bi-directional causal relationships between obesity and Vitamin D Status [1], while the other one from an empirical study on the impact of colonial history on the economic development of various regions [2].\n\n- The first bi-directional dataset is based on GWAS summary data from [1] and a publicly available website. For obesity (X) and Vitamin D status (Y), we selected 16 related SNPs as candidate IVs, including FTO, FAIM2, DHCR7, and CYP24A1. FTO and FAIM2 are valid IVs for \\(X \\to Y\\), while DHCR7 and CYP24A1 are valid IVs for \\(Y \\to X\\), with causal effects of -1.15 and -0.05, respectively. These results align with findings in [1].\n\n- The second one-directional dataset, the Colonial Origins dataset, consists of Institutions(X), and Economic Development(Y), with other 8 variables as candidate IVs [2]. They are Latitude, European settlements in 1900 (euro1900), Log European settler mortality(logem4), etc. We find that our method selects euro1900 and logem4 as valid IVs, with the estimated causal effect 0.861, which are both consistent with results in [2].

The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation. Am Econ Rev, 2001.\n\n>**Q1.** How does your method perform when the assumptions (e.g., independence of genetic variants) are violated in practice?\n\n**A1:** First, we conducted experiments with dependent genetic variants on both bi-directional and one-directional MR data, as illustrated in Appendix H.1-H.2. Table 3 shows that our method performs superiorly across various sample sizes and scenarios, even with correlated genetic variants.\n\nSecond, we performed empirical experiments with confounding among genetic variants. As shown in Table 2 of the supplementary PDF, our method remains effective across different sample sizes.\n\nThese results highlight its capability to accurately identify effective IVs and provide consistent causal effect estimates from observational data, regardless of assumption violations. This implies no need for adjustment.\n\n>**Q2.** a larger IV set or does it introduce more complexity and potential for bias with invalid instruments?\n\n**A2:** Thank you for your question. \n- A larger IV set can sometimes offer a broader range of IVs to better capture variations in the treatment variables, potentially enhancing the robustness of the estimates. However, the size of the IV set alone does not guarantee its validity for causal inference. Even with a large IV set, it might not effectively address unobserved confounders, which can introduce significant biases into the estimation results [3]. When constructing IV sets, it is crucial to ensure that the selected IVs are strongly correlated with the treatment variable while remaining conditionally independent of the outcome variable. If these conditions are not satisfied, robust causal estimates may remain elusive, regardless of the IV set size.\n\n- Moreover, a large IV set might introduce more complexity for our method (see the complexity of our method in the next answer). Therefore, introducing additional parameters, such as W in Algorithm 1, to control the set size can help manage complexity and reduce potential bias.\n\n[3] Zawadzki R S., et al. Frameworks for estimating causal effects in observational settings: comparing confounder adjustment and instrumental variables. BMC Med Res Methodol, 2023.\n\n>**Q3.** constructing the IV set dependent on the order in which instruments are considered? \n\n**A3:** We would like to clarify that our algorithm does not depend on the order of the candidate IVs. As demonstrated in Lines 3-4 and 9-11 of Algorithm 4 in Appendix E, we evaluate simultaneously all subsets of IVs and compute their corresponding correlations, ultimately selecting the subset with the minimum correlation. It ensures the robustness of the algorithm. \n\n>**Q4.** large-scale datasets efficiently?  computational complexities? \n\n**A4:** In summary, the computational complexity of our PReBiM algorithm is:\n\n $\\sum_{k=0}^{t} (2\\binom{g-kW}{2} + \\frac{(2g-(2k+1)W-2)(W-1)}{2}) + 2W(t-1)$, \n\nwhere g is the number of IVs, W is the maximum length of the IV set, and t is the number of loops. \n\nFor validation, we performed synthetic experiments on S(10,10,30) and S(15,15,40), with 30 and 40 IVs, respectively. Results are shown in Table 1 of the supplementary PDF. We observe that the overall performance of all methods decreases with larger-scale IVs, but our method still outperforms the baselines.'}}, 'id': 'HV5NWugPwO', 'forum': 'S2P6KPLtm8', 'replyto': 'tEsFNU0xNi', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13457/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13457/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13457/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723020687239, 'cdate': 1723020687239, 'tmdate': 1730883039407, 'mdate': 1730883039407, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': ""We truly appreciate your insightful and encouraging comments.

We employed the **linearity assumption to entail the theoretical identifiability** of the bi-directional MR model, while the linearity model could enjoy some remarkable characteristics. \n- **Linear models have also been widely explored and used** in many practical situations [Pearl, 2009, Spirtes et al., 2000, Imbens and Rubin, 2015], often providing meaningful results [Kang et al., 2016, Windmeijer et al., 2021, Silva and Shimizu, 2017, Li and Ye, 2022]. Hence, we focus primarily on linear models, other than nonlinear ones. We leave nonlinear models to be our future works.\n\n>**W2. the experimental results are mainly synthetic in nature.**\n\nWe performed experiments on two real-world datasets. One is derived from a study on causal relationships btw. obesity and Vitamin D Status [Vimaleswaran et al., 2013], while the other one from an empirical study on the impact of colonial history on the economic development of various regions [Acemoglu et al., 2001].\n- The first bi-directional dataset is produced based on the GWAS summary data from [Vimaleswaran et al., 2013] and a publicly available website. With obesity (X) and Vitamin D Status (Y), we selected 16 related SNPs as candidate IVs. They are fat mass and obesity-associated-rs9939609(FTO), Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2-rs7138803(FAIM2), 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase-rs12785878(DHCR7), cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1-rs6013897(CYP24A1), etc. We entail FTO and FAIM2 to be the valid IVs related to $X\\to Y$ while DHCR7 and CYP24A1 are related to $Y\\to X$. These results are in accordance with findings [Vimaleswaran et al., 2013]. \n- The second one-directional dataset, the Colonial Origins dataset, consists of Institutions(X), and Economic Development(Y), with other 8 variables as candidate IVs [Acemoglu et al., 2001]. They are Latitude (lat_abst), European settlements in 1900 (euro1900), Log European settler mortality(logem4), etc. We find that our method selects euro1900 and logem4 as valid IVs, with the estimated causal effect 0.861, which are both consistent with results in [Acemoglu et al., 2001]. Will add the data details and results.\n\n>**Q1. In line 106, why $\\beta_{X\\to Y}\\beta_{Y\\to X}\\neq1$ is necessary and what happens when violated.**\n\nWe’d like to clarify if $\\beta_{X \\to Y}\\beta_{Y\\to X} = 1$, causal effects $\\beta_{X\\to Y}$ and $\\beta_{Y\\to X}$ are not identifiable, even given the valid IV. This condition serves as the fundamental identification criterion for Eq.(1). For more details, please see pages 402-407 of [Hausman, 1983]. Will explain it. \n\n>**Q2. Why Assumption 3 is necessary for the identifiability of IVs?**\n\nNote that according to Proposition 3, we obtain the IV set for one of the causal relationships, either $X\\to Y$ or $Y\\to X$. To achieve full identifiability of valid IVs in a bi-directional MR model, we need to further determine which causal direction the IV set is related to. Thus, to render the causal effects identifiable, we introduce Assumption 3 [Xue and Pan, 2020]. It employs the correlations between IVs and phenotypes to find the related direction for the IV set. We have included the necessity of assumptions in the revision.\n\n>**Q3-W3. genetic variants are randomized...dependence btw. genetic variants. Does this claim still hold when there is confounding among the genetic variants or between the genetic variants and some phenotype? Or does the dependence just mean direct causal effect here?**\n\nThanks for your valuable comments. We conjecture that the claim still holds when there is confounding among the genetic variants or between the genetic variants and some phenotype. Following the example's proof in Appendix D, one can prove some simple examples of these cases (Due to space limitations, we do not provide detailed proofs here but will offer them in the revision).\n- In addition to the example proofs, we also performed empirical experiments to validate the first case. In Table 2 of the supplemented PDF, we see that when there’s confounding between genetic variants, our method remains effective with different sample sizes.\n- It's worth noting particularly that when there's confounding between a genetic variant pointing to X and X (not Y), our conjecture still holds; when the confounding is between the genetic variant pointing to X and Y, we would need this confounding factor to be observable to control the conditional independence between the genetic variant and Y. Will leave such general research into our future work.\n\n>**Q4. ...using some linearization technique for scenarios where causal relationships are not necessarily linear?** \n\nThis is a very good point. When causal relationships are not necessarily linear, one can practically apply some linearization technique, mapping nonlinear causal relationships to possibly linear ones. In such a case with possibly linearity data, our conclusions might be still feasible. And we leave it as our future work, i.e., how to deal with not necessarily linear data as well as complex nonlinear data. Will add this discussion.\n\n**References**\n\nJudea Pearl.

In fact, this condition serves as the fundamental identification criterion for Eq.(1). For more detailed information, please refer to pages 402-407 of [Hausman, 1983]. We will include this discussion in the revision.\n\n>**Q2: Could you explain what ""cluster fusion"" means exactly in the paper and why the proposed algorithm is said to be ""cluster fusion-like""?**\n\nA cluster is considered a valid IV set.

When it comes to the complicated structure with the vertical pleiotropy effect from IV (denote another phenotype as T), we could find that such an IV still satisfies Assumption A2 [Exclusion Restriction] once given T. So we could upgrade Definition 1 of Pseudo-Residual conditional T, where $\\omega_{\\mathbb{G}}$ is obtained by Two-Stage Least Squares (TSLS) estimator but also needs to be conditional on T. We will add it with an example in Section 5 Discussion and regard it as our future work. Thanks again.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Vimaleswaran K S, Berry D J, Lu C, et al.

While stronger language models can enhance multimodal capabilities, the design choices for vision components are often insufficiently explored and disconnected from visual representation learning research. This gap hinders accurate sensory grounding in real-world scenarios. Our study uses LLMs and visual instruction tuning as an interface to evaluate various visual representations, offering new insights into different models and architectures—self-supervised, strongly supervised, or combinations thereof—based on experiments with over 15 vision models. We critically examine existing MLLM benchmarks, addressing the difficulties involved in consolidating and interpreting results from various tasks. To further improve visual grounding, we propose spatial vision aggregator (SVA), a dynamic and spatially-aware connector that integrates vision features with LLMs while reducing the number of tokens. Additionally, we discuss the curation of high-quality visual instruction-tuning data from publicly available sources, emphasizing the importance of distribution balancing. Collectively, Cambrian-1 not only achieves state-of-the-art performances but also serves as a comprehensive, open cookbook for instruction-tuned MLLMs. We provide model weights, code, supporting tools, datasets, and detailed instruction-tuning and evaluation recipes.

We currently list all datasets used in Appx. E1, but will add information on their licenses, copyright information, and how we maintain compliance with each dataset’s terms.\n2. **Data engine:** Our web agent collects data solely from Wikipedia, which is licensed under CC BY-SA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights). We will add details on how we adhere to this license.\n3. **Consent considerations:**\n   - Existing datasets: We will review and report on any consent procedures used by the datasets we incorporate, acknowledging any limitations or concerns.\n   - Wikipedia data: We will mention the implicit consent given by Wikipedia contributors under the site\'s terms of service.\n\n\n> **Q2: Bias and Fairness**\n\nWe appreciate the importance of addressing potential biases related to demographic variables. While comprehensive mitigation of bias in MLLMs is not the objective of our work—and, in our opinion, is challenging enough to warrant a standalone work in itself—we recognize its significance. We will include a section including:\n\n1. An analysis of demographic variables in our Cambrian-10M dataset, highlighting any observed patterns or imbalances.\n2. A discussion of how training a model on data with inherent biases perpetuates them, as well as challenges and potential unintended consequences of artificially modifying data distributions to address said biases.\n3. Acknowledgment that the thorough mitigation of bias in large-scale MLLMs is a complex issue worthy of dedicated research, and we hope our analysis will spur future work focused on this critical issue.\n\n\n> **Q3: Transparency and Interpretability of the Model’s decision-making processes**\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer\'s suggestion around model interpretability. However, it\'s important to note that **understanding the decision-making processes of LLMs / MLLMs is a challenging research problem in itself, with only very preliminary work in this direction.** Recent work [1][2][3] has made initial progress toward the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, but such methods are not yet applicable to open-source models or MLLMs.\n\nWhile full interpretability of a MLLM\'s decision-making process is beyond the current state-of-the-art, we can provide some insights into the workings of our SVA module. Specifically, as described in our rebuttal to Reviewer ED7N, we will include an analysis of the attention scores across different vision encoders in our SVA module for various types of images and tasks. This analysis will shed light on how different vision models contribute to the overall visual understanding in different scenarios.\n\n> **Q4: Potential Misuse and Mitigation Strategies**\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer\'s concern about potential misuse of our technology.\n\nHowever, we must clarify a fundamental misunderstanding: **MLLMs like Cambrian-1 are not capable of generating deepfakes.** They take text + images as input and produce text as output. They cannot generate, manipulate, or synthesize images or videos, as deepfakes entail.\n\nThat said, we acknowledge that MLLMs can potentially be misused in other ways, and we take these concerns seriously. We will add discussion of potential risks and mitigation strategies, including:\n\n1. **Misinformation:** MLLMs could be used to generate misleading text descriptions of images or to craft false narratives about visual content. To mitigate this, we will provide guidelines for responsible use of our model.\n\n2. **Hallucination:** Like LLMs, MLLMs might generate outputs not grounded in facts or input data. We will clearly communicate this limitation to users.\n\n---\n\nThank you again for your valuable feedback on the ethical considerations of our work.

We summarize and respond to your questions below: \n\n> **Q1: Does performance saturate with the increase of (D) and (G) in SVA**\n\nA: We recognize the importance of this point and have conducted experiments to further investigate it. We tabulate results below. We observe performance improves with increasing D & G and saturates with D > 4 or G >3.\n\n |D|G|OCR & Chart|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|2|1|52.1|\n|3|1|52.4|\n|4|1|52.8|\n|5|1|52.1|\n|3|1|52.4|\n|3|2|52.6|\n|3|3|53.1|\n|3|4|52.8|\n\n> **Q2: Data, Leakage, and effectiveness** \n\nA: Our data is collected from existing open-source works. Therefore, we prevent data leakage problems by carefully choosing only the training set of data sources. For our Internet Data Engine, we focus on only Wikipedia in our project, which does not overlap with our benchmarks. \nIn the revision, we will add a section reporting the number of test images in each benchmark present in our final Cambrian-10M dataset by checking image hashes.\n\n> **Q3&4: Increasing data threshold t will not enhance the performance* and *whether higher data quality results in better performance**\n\nA: As we show in §5.2, data quality matters more than quantity. In Tab. 2, intermediate t values result in better performance. This result echoes observations in the data curation pipelines of CLIP and MetaCLIP\nLikewise, we observe that our higher-quality 7M subset results in better benchmark performance compared to training on all 10M data (Tab. 3). We believe this is a result of better balancing the dataset sources (Tab. 2, Fig. 14) and adjusting their relative sizes (Fig. 10).\n\n> **Q5: response length, difficulty, diversity of instruction-tuning data**\n\nA: Thank you for raising these questions! We have conducted further analysis on Cambrian-7M and -10M regarding data composition, length of questions, length of responses, and number of rounds in the instruction tuning data and summarized the results in Tab. 1 of the rebuttal material. As a result of data curation, the Cambrian-7M data are distributed similarly to the best data ratio we found in the data ratio experiment (Fig. 10). \n\n> **Q6: Compare current MLLMs using the same data**\n\nA: Like many previous studies in (M)LLMs, we argue that data is crucial in distinguishing different works. We conduct additional experiments with the LLaVA model trained using LLaMA-3-8b and Cambrian-7M data. Due to the short rebuttal period, we use the conventional 576 visual tokens of LLaVA-1.5, not the high-resolution approach of LLaVA-Next. Despite fewer tokens, this version performs comparably or better than LLaVA-Next in general, knowledge, and vision tasks. Adding our SVA further improves performance, especially in OCR & Chart tasks, while still using only 576 tokens.\n\n|Data|# Vis Token|General|Knowledge|OCR & Chart|Vision-Centric|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|LLaVA-Next|2880|72.5|55.6|61.0|55.0|\n|LLaVA w/ Cambrian Data|576|72.0|58.1|54.3|55.6|\n|Cambrian-8B|576|74.4|60.1|66.2|60.3|\n\n> **Q7: Evaluate on high resolution benchmarks such as V*Bench**\n\nA: In our work, we adopt V*Bench in our evaluation—see “V*Star” in Tabs. 4, 11, & 13. On V*Star, Cambrian-1 is competitive with LLaVA-NeXT and GPT-4V. \n \n> **Q8: Determine if unfreezing visual encoder outperforms freezing in all tasks, convergence speed**\n\nUnfreezing most visual encoders outperforms freezing in most tasks. We have added a visualization to the rebuttal material (Fig. 1) that shows the %change from Frozen to Unfrozen for each model on each benchmark. Note: full Frozen & Unfrozen benchmark results are in Tables 9 & 10.\n\nThanks for raising the point about convergence speed. Given fixed compute, unfreezing is approximately 50-55% slower during fine-tuning. We will emphasize this drawback in the revision.\n\n> **Q9: Integrate more vision encoders does not lead to higher performance on every benchmark**\n\nA: Indeed, more vision encoders does not lead to higher performance on *every* benchmark. We believe this is expected, as different vision encoders have different strengths/weaknesses—as studied in §3.4 and Fig. 6—and thus different combinations of vision encoders inherit combinations of these strengths/weaknesses.\nWe will amend the 7th Finding to clarify that combining multiple vision encoders usually enhances performance, *but not necessarily on every benchmark*.\n\n> **Q10: Provide more detail about parameter count and training hyperparameters**\n\nA: Tab. 14 provides training hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, weight decay, etc. We have added compute resources and training durations in the Rebuttal Tab. 2.\n\n> **Q11: Could a unified vision encoder be used**\n\nA: As studied in this work, we do not have a “perfect” encoder that excels in all areas (visual grounding, language understanding, high-resolution features, etc). Therefore, we pursue hybrid encoders, which can leverage the different strengths of several pretrained visual encoders. We acknowledge that hybrid vision encoders are a work-around solution to take advantage of various pretrained models—unified vision encoders could be trained from scratch with superior performance, but that would require much more compute and data.\nOverall, we advocate to use MLLMs as a vision model evaluator and hope to inspire the development of a unified and powerful vision model. \n \n> **Q12: More Related Works**\n\nA: We thank the reviewers for providing these new references. We will add these references to the revision. Specifically, we will add MiniGPT-4 and LLama-adapter V2 to our discussion of developing MLLMs, and we will add Visionllm, Tem-adapter, Segment and Caption Anything, and Universal Segmentation to our discussion on the downstream applications of MLLMs.'}}, 'id': 'j7thZe9Rjp', 'forum': 'Vi8AepAXGy', 'replyto': 'YfWtp6ScHL', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Official_Review4/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723001241129, 'cdate': 1723001241129, 'tmdate': 1730880939423, 'mdate': 1730880939423, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the thorough review and acknowledgments. We appreciate that you find our work is “well-written”, contains “extensive experiments” and “good performance”, and will “definitely benefit the community” when open-sourced. We summarize your questions and provide responses below: \n\n> **W1&3: Findings are well-known and verified from previous work**\n\nA: We believe the study of the Multimodal Large Language Model contains many moving parts, and previous works provide isolated studies on each component. This potentially leads to contradictory results in different studies (e.g., freeze or unfreeze vision encoder in Prismatic VLM vs. Deepseek VL). Our work undertakes a *systematic study*, isolating and studying the numerous moving parts, which we believe allows more long-standing conclusions that benefit the community. \n\nFurther, we respectfully argue that our work differs from previous works in the following ways:\n\n- *More Comprehensive Experiments*: Our study considers more vision backbones and organized benchmarks than previous works, yielding new insights. For example, we find that high-resolution ConvNets benefit OCR & Chart tasks, and self-supervised learning models can potentially compete with language-supervised ones. Our experiments also reveal the properties of different CLIP models (e.g., SigLIP, EVA-CLIP) beyond ImageNet accuracy, providing valuable insights for both MLLM and Vision model developers. For instance, we observe that EVA-CLIP performs well in most domains but struggles with Chart tasks. This highlights the need for CLIP developers to focus more on OCR & Chart data collection during training.\n- *Findings on high-res encoders*: While concurrent works emphasize the importance of high-resolution features, we take a step further to pinpoint the potential of using ConvNets, such as the ConvNext OpenCLIP model, to efficiently and effectively process high-resolution images. \n- *New Vision Model Aggregation Strategy*: Compared to previous works that focus on fusing vision models, we study both *which models to combine* (§3.5) and *strategies for combining them* (§4). Our SVA approach preserves the resolution, maintains the spatial inductive bias in images, and uses a fixed number of visual tokens.\n\nWe also thank the reviewer for raising this point and suggesting these works. We will discuss each of them in our revision. \n\n> **W2: Training only using proposed tuning datasets, compare with LLaVA 1.6**\n\nA: We first want to clarify that LLaVA 1.6 (LLaVA-Next) proposes a dynamic resolution approach using *2880* tokens, while our SVA module uses only *576* fixed tokens. We conduct additional experiments with the LLaVA model trained using LLaMA-3-8b and Cambrian-7M data. Due to the short rebuttal period, we use the conventional 576 visual tokens in LLaVA and LLaVA-1.5, not the dynamic high-resolution proposal of LLaVA-Next. Despite fewer tokens, this version matches or outperforms LLaVA-Next in General, Knowledge, and Vision-Centric tasks. Adding our SVA module further improves performance, especially in OCR & Chart tasks, while still using only 576 tokens.\n\n|Data|# of Vis Tokens|General|Knowledge|OCR & Chart|Vision-Centric|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|LLaVA-Next|2880|72.5|55.6|61.0|55.0|\n|LLaVA w/ Cambrian Data|576|72.0|58.1|54.3|55.6|\n|Cambrian-8B|576|74.4|60.1|66.2|60.3| \n\n> **W4: Several figures are useless and common knowledge for MLLM (e.g, Figs. 1 & 2)**\n\nA: We hope our work provides a systematic study around MLLMs and can serve as informational for audiences both within and beyond the MLLM community. Especially now, as MLLM is becoming an ever-growing community, the introduction and figures serve as preparation and context-setting for a broader audience. We make no claims of novel findings in the initial figures and reserve such insights for the later sections after providing the audience requisite context. Nevertheless, we thank the reviewer for raising this concern, and we will consider condensing our presentation in the revised version.\n\n> **W5: Study of SVA Module is not enough**\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for raising this crucial point. We have added a study of the importance of visual features from different vision models to different image categories by investigating the attention score distribution in our SVA module.\n\nWe evaluate our Cambrian-8b model on GQA, DocVQA, and ScienceQA (representing three different benchmark categories), and tabulate attention distributions below. We can see that on real-world images (GQA), the contribution of different vision models is relatively uniform, in part due to the similar characteristics of SigLIP and CLIP. On document-type images (DocVQA) which are text-heavy and often high-resolution, the influence of SigLIP increases and that of ConvNext greatly increases to aid in high-resolution information processing. For scientific images (ScienceQA) composed of illustrations and diagrams about different science categories, the contribution of SigLIP is further increased while the portion of DINOv2 decreases compared to GQA.\n\n|Model|GQA|DocVQA|ScienceQA|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|\n|SigLIP|29.7%|31.1%|35.2%|\n|CLIP|18.5%|13.4%|16.3%|\n|DINOv2|24.1%|11.0%|17.6%|\n|ConvNext|27.7%|44.5%|30.9%|\n\nWe also study the performance of our Cambrian-8b model with SVA modules on different sizes of alignment and instruction tuning data. The results are shown below. We can see that increasing the size of alignment data leads to improvement in all benchmark categories. Increasing the size of instruction tuning data leads to notable overall improvement, and the instruction tuning data is especially helpful for Knowledge, OCR & Chart, and Vision-Centric tasks.\n\n||General|Knowledge|OCR & Chart|Vision-Centric|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|1.2M alignment + 0.7M instruction|72.3|54.8|58.3|57.2|\n|2.5M alignment + 0.7M instruction|72.7|55.8|58.9|58.3|\n|2.5M alignment + 7M instruction|74.4|60.1|66.2|60.3|'}}, 'id': 'BTxyOqro7o', 'forum': 'Vi8AepAXGy', 'replyto': 'Bqjua7O5JZ', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Official_Review1/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722986423374, 'cdate': 1722986423374, 'tmdate': 1730880938946, 'mdate': 1730880938946, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the thorough review and acknowledgments.

We share our thoughts on these models below and show our findings in Cambrian are **very transferable** to these native models. We will add the discussion below to the revised version of our draft.  \n\n**Thoughts about native MLLMs** \n\nWe find native Multimodal LLMs that do not use a pre-trained vision encoder, like GPT-4o or Reka, to be an intriguing and promising approach. These native models have only recently been explored and are predominantly developed by proprietary companies such as OpenAI. As a result, their actual implementation, architecture, and training methods remain largely undisclosed. Additionally, there is insufficient evidence to assert that native MLLMs can overcome the limitations of current MLLMs, such as their visual deficiencies. On the other hand, vision-only representation learning itself is a significant and meaningful objective. Our study connects this goal with multimodal learning, providing scientific insights that complement future advancements in multimodal systems, whether they are native or not.\n\nWe note that one major downside of native MLLMs is that they require *much* more data and computational resources, as they do not rely on the knowledge embedded in pretrained encoders.\n\n**Findings in Cambrian transfer to native MLLMs** \n\nWe believe the findings and contributions in our work will continue to hold and guide the development of future models, including “native” MLLMs. Our findings regarding Data, Connectors, Evaluation, and Vision Backbones can be transferred in the following ways: \n- **Data**: The pool of instruction tuning data and our data curation studies can be very useful for supervised fine-tuning “native” MLLMs. Training native MLLMs is likely to still consist of pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF. The data collection and curation insights can play an important role in both the pretraining and supervised fine-tuning stages.\n- **Connector**: The SVA module we proposed can be part of, or inspiration for, future native MLLM designs. The conflict between high-resolution features and a constrained number of tokens is likely to continue in native MLLMs. Therefore, the SVA module could be a competitive candidate for resolving this issue in such native MLLMs.\n- **Evaluation**: Our study on the “Multimodality” of benchmarks can help native MLLMs better assess their visual capability. The categorization of benchmarks also provides more organized and interpretable evaluation protocols for future works, especially in vision-centric domains.\n- **Vision Backbones**: Our study compares current visual representations, uncovering insights about training data (e.g., CLIP vs. SSL), training methods (Encoding vs. Generative), network architecture (ViT vs. ConvNext), and image resolutions. These insights can better guide developers when designing architecture, data, and methods for training native MLLMs.'}}, 'id': '4wGSESvG0E', 'forum': 'Vi8AepAXGy', 'replyto': 'UVbJGbsq2a', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Official_Review3/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722985728018, 'cdate': 1722985728018, 'tmdate': 1730880939042, 'mdate': 1730880939042, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the thorough review and acknowledgments. We appreciate that you find our work “notably well-written”, “shows the limitations of MLLM benchmarks”, and “a great contribution to this field” via our fully-open approach. We summarize your questions and provide our explanations below: \n\n> **W1: Comparison and Discussion between SVA and C/D-Abstractor**\n\nA: We appreciate the valuable suggestion. We provide such discussion and analyses here, and will incorporate this into our revision.\n\nWe first emphasize that our SVA module is distinct from other spatial-based connectors (e.g., C/D-Abstractor) in its ability to dynamically combine visual features from *multiple* vision models with *varying* resolutions.\n\nHowever, to isolate the effect of spatial inductive bias, we consider the case of token reduction using a single vision encoder. Specifically, we use OpenAI CLIP as the vision model and compress its original 576 tokens to 36 tokens using our SVA module and other connectors. We include three baselines:\n\n1. Direct interpolation + MLP\n2. C-Abstractor\n3. LDPNetV2Projector (similar to C-Abstractor but more light-weight)\n\nWe conduct experiments with the 1.2M alignment + 0.7M instruction tuning data setting with Vicuna-1.5-7b as the language model. For fair comparison, we do not include multi-layer aggregation inside the LLM for our SVA baseline.\n\nWe tabulate results below:\n\n| Method            | General | Knowledge | OCR & Chart | Vision-Centric |\n|-------------------|:-------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|\n| Interpolate + MLP |  63.4   |   43.8    |    28.1     |      43.7      |\n| C-Abstractor      |  64.4   |   42.8    |    26.1     |      44.3      |\n| LDPNetV2          |  62.5   |   43.9    |    28.7     |      43.9      |\n| SVA               |**65.5** | **44.5**  |  **31.4**   |    **46.9**    |\n\nCompared with the simple MLP baseline, C-Abstractor performs better on General and Vision-Centric tasks but inferior on Knowledge and OCR & Chart tasks. LDPNetV2 performs similarly to the MLP baseline. Our SVA consistently demonstrates superior performance across all categories, especially in OCR & Chart and Vision-Centric tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in information compression.\n\nOne possible explanation for SVA\'s data efficiency compared to C-Abstractor is that the SVA module performs local attention on all positions in the grid with the same parameters, so our SVA module receives more supervision.\n\n\n> **W2: Overlapping findings with existing studies**\n \nA: We believe the study of the Multimodal Large Language Model contains many moving parts, and previous works provide isolated studies on each component. This potentially leads to contradictory results in different studies (e.g., freeze or unfreeze vision in Prismatic VLM vs. Deepseek VL). \n\nOur work undertakes a systematic study, combining different moving parts together. We hope to draw more robust and reliable conclusions and clarify the contradicting conclusions that exist in the MLLM domain. In the meantime, we aim to push the study of these modules to the extreme, especially in the fully open-source setting. For example, we carefully compare 15+ vision models, hoping to provide insights to both the MLLM and visual representation learning communities. We also collect and curate, to our knowledge, the largest open-source instruction tuning datasets. These efforts turn the findings in our work into pieces that narrow the gap between open-source and proprietary models.\n\n> **W3: Finding 7**\n\nA: Regarding Finding 7, we draw this conclusion based on multiple experiments rather than a single data point. We observed that, compared to ensembling only CLIP models, adding the DINOv2 model improves performance, especially on vision-centric benchmarks like RealWorldQA and CV-Bench. We appreciate the reviewer\'s feedback and will include more clarification on this finding in our revision.\n\n\n> **Q1: Question about model combination and two entries for ""SigLIP+DINOv2+ConvNeXt""**\n\nA: Thank you for reviewing our work so carefully and catching this typo! The second instance of “SigLIP+DINOv2+ConvNeXt” uses a ConvNeXt-L not an XXL.\nWe will correct this in the revised version of the draft.\n\n> **L1: Privacy of Internet Web Search** \n\nA: Thank you for raising this question! We absolutely value the importance of data privacy and copyright. We respect and approach this issue in the following two ways:\n\n*Collect Data from Licensed Websites*: Our web agent collects data from Wikipedia, which is licensed under CC BY-SA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights). We attribute the data source in §5.1 and Appx. E.2. \n*Fully Open Source Data Collection*: We also fully open-source our data collection pipeline in Appx. E. This transparency allows for thorough inspection and verification, ensuring that our methods do not violate any copyright or data privacy regulations.\n\nData privacy is a collective challenge faced by the community, and proprietary models often do not disclose details about their data pipeline. One of the aims of our project is to raise awareness and inspire new research on this topic by being *fully* transparent. We will release all details of the data collection pipeline and plan to include a section in the revision to discuss this further.'}}, 'id': '0TRe95ixJ7', 'forum': 'Vi8AepAXGy', 'replyto': 'Wt9GZQs0F9', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Authors'], 'number': 1, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3429/Official_Review2/-/Rebuttal', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1722985034444, 'cdate': 1722985034444, 'tmdate': 1730880938990, 'mdate': 1730880938990, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'summary': {'value': ""The paper explores Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and constructs the Cambrian-1 series models.

"['Gang Liu', 'Jiaxin Xu', 'Tengfei Luo', 'Meng Jiang']",NeurIPS,Graph Diffusion Transformers for Multi-Conditional Molecular Generation,https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/oral/97964,2024," Inverse molecular design with diffusion models holds great potential for advancements in material and drug discovery. Despite success in unconditional molecule generation, integrating multiple properties such as synthetic score and gas permeability as condition constraints into diffusion models remains unexplored. We present the Graph Diffusion Transformer (Graph DiT) for multi-conditional molecular generation. Graph DiT has a condition encoder to learn the representation of numerical and categorical properties and utilizes a Transformer-based graph denoiser to achieve molecular graph denoising under conditions. Unlike previous graph diffusion models that add noise separately on the atoms and bonds in the forward diffusion process, we propose a graph-dependent noise model for training Graph DiT, designed to accurately estimate graph-related noise in molecules. We extensively validate the Graph DiT for multi-conditional polymer and small molecule generation. Results demonstrate our superiority across metrics from distribution learning to condition control for molecular properties. A polymer inverse design task for gas separation with feedback from domain experts further demonstrates its practical utility.

Below is a concise summary of our discussion in a question-and-answer format to ensure clarity:\n\n---\n# Are Uniqueness and Novelty metrics important?\n**Yes.** Uniqueness measures the diversity of generated molecules at the instance level, while Novelty ensures the generative model creates new molecules rather than merely memorizing training examples. \n\nWe agree with the reviewer and have reported these metrics in our initial rebuttal. Graph DiT has a Novelty value of 0.9702 and a Uniqueness value of 0.8919, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and novel examples.\n\n# Do high Uniqueness and Novelty always indicate better model performance?\n\n**Not necessarily.** High uniqueness and novelty do not guarantee that generated molecules will meet desirable multi-property criteria. Another example is the AddCarbon algorithm. While it has high uniqueness and novelty [1], it has been considered less useful in previous research [2].\n\n# Do low Uniqueness and Novelty always indicate worse model performance?\n\n**Not entirely.** In molecular discovery, even a single new and useful molecule can have significant real-life impacts. A model with relatively low Uniqueness, but with strong condition controllability, may still identify a new valuable molecule, even if it is repeated multiple times in generation.\n\n# Can Uniqueness alone represent generation diversity?\n\n**Probably not.** While uniqueness is an important measure of instance-level diversity, it only yields a binary result (0 or 1) when measuring a pair of molecules. The metric of internal diversity used in the paper provides a more nuanced evaluation by calculating structural differences with values between 0 and 1.\n\n# Can Uniqueness alone represent generation distribution learning?\n**No.** It's important to consider distribution fitting metrics like Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD) and structure-based similarity (Similarity), as used in our paper. These metrics are defined on the reference set (i.e., test set) in the paper to avoid potential overfitting concerns.\n\n# Is there a one-size-fits-all metric for evaluating molecular discovery?\n\n**To the best of our knowledge, no.** This is why we extensively evaluate models using up to 9 metrics and conduct surveys to gather feedback from material scientists. We aim to comprehensively present model performance for higher chances of discovering new and useful molecules that meet multiple properties. We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to include Novelty and Uniqueness for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n---\n\nWe sincerely appreciate the reviewer's time and effort in our discussion. We hope this summary clarifies any misunderstandings and aligns us on the metrics of molecular discovery.

To clarify, we previously stated (Initial Rebuttal):\n\n> Randomly adding carbons to existing molecules can yield almost 100% novelty and uniqueness.\n\nIn our second round of responses, we mentioned:\n\n> Table 1 in Reference 1 indicates that the AddCarbon method achieves 99.94% Novelty and 99.86% Uniqueness, both approaching 100%.\n\nWe believe these two statements are consistent. The confusion may stem from our earlier comment (Initial Rebuttal):\n\n> We did not choose uniqueness and novelty as major metrics because recent research shows they can be flawed.\n\nAs stated in our last response, we agree that Uniqueness and Novelty are important. In our discussion, the additional thoughts we want to share is: relying **solely** on these metrics may be insufficient, as their ceiling may be the AddCarbon method, and as quoted from the new reference [1]: \n\n> The fact, that the simple AddCarbon model is useless in practice and still obtains good scores, casts some doubt if currently used metrics are sufficient to estimate performance.\n\nThis raises concerns and explains why we originally thought Uniqueness and Novelty might be flawed metrics.

This supports the claim that ""randomly adding carbons to existing molecules can yield...""\n\nBased on this, Uniqueness may not always work as expected, particularly in cases as mentioned by the reviewer when evaluating a model ""whether it only generates simple carbon chains""\n\nFor Novelty, consider three examples: `C` (a single carbon), `CC` (two carbons), and `c1ccccc1` (an aromatic ring). The Novelty metric produces a score of 1 when comparing `C` with either `CC` or `c1ccccc1`, yet the internal diversity metric, as used in the paper, better reveals structural differences when comparing `C` with `CC`/`c1ccccc1`.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that Uniqueness and Novelty are important indicators and appreciate the feedback.

We believe that conditional generation based on multiple gas permeability properties is a challenging task.\n\nFirst, **the condition space for gas permeability is vast**, as noted in Line 26, where gas permeability varies widely, exceeding 10,000 Barrier units. This variability presents significant technical challenges in controlling polymer generation across such a broad condition space.\n\nSecond, **the task relatedness in multiconditions does not reduce the difficulty but rather increases it**. As detailed in Section 4.3, polymers often require high permeability for one gas and low permeability for another, making it challenging for the generation model to capture the crucial differences between various gas permeability properties. The GSK3β and JNK3 properties mentioned by the reviewer also have relatedness, as both are serine/threonine protein kinases.\n\nFinally, we have provided additional results to further clarify our model's performance (best results are highlighted for distribution learning and condition control).\n\n| Method     | Validity ↑ | Coverage ↑ | Diversity ↑ | Similarity ↑ | Distance ↓  | Synth.

We would also like to share additional thoughts on drug and material discovery. This field may focus on individual instances that have significant real-world impacts. A model capable of suggesting a single valid, novel, and unique drug or material that satisfies diverse property requirements, even if it produces many invalid ones (resulting in lower VUN metrics), may be promising as well compared to other models that generates numerous valid, novel, and unique suggestions but fails to meet specific condition requirements. \n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's follow-up questions and welcome further discussion on any concerns the reviewer feels have not yet been fully addressed.""}}, 'id': 'dSVTT0adou', 'forum': 'cfrDLD1wfO', 'replyto': 'NZQnHJ3F4D', 'signatures': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2570/Authors'], 'readers': ['everyone'], 'writers': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2570/Authors'], 'number': 11, 'invitations': ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2570/-/Official_Comment', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit'], 'domain': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'tcdate': 1723500187137, 'cdate': 1723500187137, 'tmdate': 1730890056858, 'mdate': 1730890056858, 'license': 'CC BY 4.0', 'version': 2}, {'content': {'title': {'value': ""Response to Authors' Rebuttal""}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the authors\' responses.

Instead, we use internal diversity to better reflect generation diversity."" Additionally, I could not find evidence of the alleged deficiencies in uniqueness and novelty as mentioned in reference [1]. Could the authors provide evidence supporting the above claims? On the contrary, simply adding carbon atoms, such as carbon chains, tends to result in nearly 100% validity. Uniqueness is an effective measure to assess the model\'s distribution learning capability (i.e., whether it only generates simple carbon chains), while novelty serves as an indicator of whether the model is experiencing overfitting.\n\nBased on the additional experimental results, the proposed DiT model\'s uniqueness is not high, at only 0.89. Furthermore, the validity (second to last) and novelty (third to last) do not outperform the baseline models.

Instead, we use internal diversity to better reflect generation diversity.\n\n## Current evaluation has 9 metrics, enhanced by expertise\n\nWe defend our nine metrics for evaluating molecular quality, practical utility, and diversity. These metrics cover chemical validity, distribution matching (diversity, distance, similarity), and multi-condition controllability.\n\nAdditionally, Section 4.3 includes case studies with domain experts, providing valuable assessments often lacking in previous studies.\n\nBased on the above points, we respectfully request a reconsideration of the assessment if the reviewer finds these metrics sufficient.

Condition control is a core goal in inverse molecular design, as we need to design drugs/materials that meet human requirements. As shown in Table 2, Graph DiT effectively improves existing baselines from 0.6 to 0.9 in this regard.\n\nBased on the above points, we respectfully request a reconsideration of the assessment that ""... results in Table 2 did not demonstrate superior performance...""\n\n## More thoughts on effectiveness and practical utility\n\nWe value the reviewer\'s opinion that an ideal model should excel across all metrics. However, we respectfully argue that defining ground-truth diversity and distribution distance is still debated with many choices (e.g. uniqueness or internal diversity). Therefore, we use up to 9 metrics to comprehensively evaluate model performance from diverse perspectives. Comparing very similar numbers, such as a distance metric of 6.7 vs. 7.0, is less compelling for demonstrating a model\'s ability to generate practically useful molecules. Significant improvement in multi-conditional controllability is more indicative of practical utility. Additionally, in Section 4.3, we involve domain experts to verify the generated results in real applications.\n\nWe greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments and invite further discussion on the matter for any remaining concerns.\n\n# Q2: Diverse scales of properties\n\n## Lines 217-218 align with the reviewer’s question\n\nThank you for the excellent question.

We have opted to use internal diversity, which offers a more nuanced reflection of generation diversity.\n\n## Tables 1 and 2 present up to 9 comprehensive metrics\n\nThe nine metrics (Lines 204-211) are comprehensive, evaluating chemical validity, distribution matching, and multi-condition controllability.

We respectfully request a re-examination of the results.\n\n# Q1: Ranking and K value\n\n## Details are in Lines 35-37, 56-57\n\nFor single-condition constraints (Lines 35-37):\n> we check whether a shared polymer structure that meets multi-property constraints can be identified across different condition sets. If we find the polymer, its rank K (where K is between 1 and 30) indicates how high it appears on the lists, considering all condition sets.

Therefore, good similarity and distance to the reference set do not indicate poor novelty, which is typically defined on the training set.\n\n# Q5: Learnable dropping embeddings\n\nIt is widely used [1,3,4] by DiT [1] and DALL-E 2 [4]. It enhances flexibility for handling missing values and improves training stability by learning representations for null embeddings.\n\n# Q6: Have you explored three or more conditions?\n\n## Yes, we explored and reported results for up to four conditions in Table 1\n\nThe HIV and BBBP datasets contain only one overlapping molecule.

In the noise addition phase, the author has employed a novel noise addition method, successfully establishing connections between the graph's nodes and edges. At the same time, the author has designed a new condition encoder and a graph diffusion transformer architecture. This architecture is capable of addressing both numerical and categorical conditions simultaneously.

Molecules that rank low on a certain single property may not necessarily rank low on other properties. Therefore, for a fair comparison, the statistical graph shown in Figure 1(b) should follow the same format as in Figure 1(a). That is, the authors should calculate and visualize the minimal $ K $ at which a molecule can satisfy all the constraints within rank $ K $ for all the generated molecules.\n- All the datasets used for drug design suffer from a severe class imbalance issue, i.e., the ratio of positive to negative samples is less than 1 to 20. Could the authors specify the approximate ratio of positive to negative samples in the input condition (label) when calculating the accuracy in Table 2? If the ratio of positive to negative samples follows the original dataset\'s proportion, using ROC-AUC seems to be a more reasonable metric.\n- How is the Avg.

The edges have the same issue. Therefore, $q(\\mathbf{X}\\_G^t|\\mathbf{X}_{G}^{t-1})$, as defined by the formula in the article, does not seem to be a distribution. However, in the specific implementation process, the graph is sampled from the ""distribution"" instead of directly using the probability as the edge and node features, which means the flaws mentioned above  theoretically should not affect the model\'s performance. But the authors need to make corrections in the writing.\n\n**Minor Issues**\n\n- Many diffusion-based generation methods for conditional generation only require the introduction of conditions during the generation process, without the need to incorporate conditions during the training process.

Graph DiT has a condition encoder to learn the representation of numerical and categorical properties and utilizes a Transformer-based graph denoiser to achieve molecular graph denoising under conditions.

We explore the Platonic view that mathematics can be discovered from its axioms---a game of conjecture and proof. We describe an agent that jointly learns to pose challenging problems for itself (conjecturing) and solve them (theorem proving). Given a mathematical domain axiomatized in dependent type theory, we first combine methods for constrained decoding and type-directed synthesis to sample valid conjectures from a language model. Our method guarantees well-formed conjectures by construction, even as we start with a randomly initialized model. We use the same model to represent a policy and value function for guiding proof search. Our agent targets generating hard but provable conjectures --- a moving target, since its own theorem proving ability also improves as it trains. We propose novel methods for hindsight relabeling on proof search trees to significantly improve the agent's sample efficiency in both tasks. Experiments on 3 axiomatic domains (propositional logic, arithmetic and group theory) demonstrate that our agent can bootstrap from only the axioms, self-improving in generating true and challenging conjectures and in finding proofs.",Oral Session 5D: Machine Learning and Science,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uNKlTQ8mBD,https://openreview.net/forum?id=uNKlTQ8mBD,uNKlTQ8mBD,"[{'content': {'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'The paper provides a novel scheme for generating mathematical conjectures and proving them when the input is the theory axioms only.\nAll reviewers acknowledged that this is a challenging and highly interesting task and that the approach is quite pioneering.

We\'re glad it addressed most of your questions.\n\n> While I think this piece is a good initial exploration into this area, ultimately I would feel that the goal should be either to (1) produce systems capable of solving problems interesting to humans or (2) doing ""alien"" mathematics.\n\nWe fully agree that either (1) or (2) would be the most interesting ultimate goals. We would argue that our system is closer right now to ""doing alien mathematics"", in the sense that it does self-improve and prove thousands of theorems that are not given to it, though these aren\'t yet of special interest to humans. Doing ""deep"" alien mathematics (in the sense of developing full mathematical theories about novel mathematical objects) will be possible with library learning - growing a library of lemmas and new definitions. Still, in either case, we would want to understand what it takes to make such alien mathematics ""interesting"" (aligning or not with human mathematics). We completely concede that we don\'t close these fundamental questions with this work, but rather open them up for study in a concrete setting with the setup we propose.\n\n> Especially since the compute requirements are quite high to get to the current results.\n\nOur compute requirements are modest compared to prior work that attempts self-improvement in formal mathematics. Each of our runs could be completed in a day on a single academic node, as mentioned in Appendix A. In contrast, expert iteration in prior work (typically in Lean) required a much larger scale to see improvements. For instance, in gpt-f lean [1], each run took ""about 2000 A100 days of compute""; this leads to solving 10 extra problems in minif2f. HTPS [2] employed 232 A100s for 7 days for each of their runs in Lean; the improvement from day 2 to day 7 was 29 extra training problems (minif2f-curriculum). Given the small absolute scale of those gains, it seems unlikely that they would be able to measure improvements at all within a day on a single GPU, as we do (> 1000x less compute). Our results could certainly be improved by increasing scale, as our setup is also embarrassingly parallel, but we believe it already allows interesting deep questions to be studied with much less compute.\n\n[1] Polu, Stanislas, et al.

NeurIPS 2022\n\n> What do you see as a way to structure the learning process to be able to prove all of these held-out theorems. For example, will more training rounds suffice?\n\nThis is a really interesting question! While a larger scale (e.g. more rounds, larger batches per round, larger Transformer, more search) could all likely improve the extrinsic results, it would not yet be the most interesting. We think that studying what to reward during self-improvement that maximizes performance in held-out problems will first help make the ""scaling law"" (improvement x compute) more favorable, for scaling up to then make sense. Here is a notable observation and ideas coming from analyzing our existing runs:\n\nHuman mathematicians tend to prefer more general theorems. Our agent doesn\'t. In fact, the conjecturer often ends up adding unnecessary/unrelated assumptions to the theorem statement as a way to make conjectures harder for the prover, because those add more actions to the action space and thus make search more challenging. There are two possible ideas to mitigate this:\n* For the conjecturer, we can reward it when it produces conjectures that generalize previous results (there are simple symbolic strategies for checking whether a theorem A trivially follows from theorem B, by checking whether A is a substitution instance of B), or penalize it when it produces conjectures that trivially follow from previous ones (using the same check).\n* For the prover, one could try a related data augmentation strategy, where after proving A, we can synthesize theorems that consist of A with extra assumptions (thus, essentially the same proof still works, after doing \'intro\' on the unnecessary assumptions). Training on these would help the prover not find theorems with unnecessary assumptions to be harder, and thus the conjecturer would be discouraged from generating those.\n\nWe don\'t know the effect of either of these strategies yet, but this is the kind of investigation that our setup allows future work to explore. Besides, the RL literature on intrinsic rewards is very rich, and we only scratch the connection here. We will include a discussion of these directions in the paper, emphasizing that should they work here, they can also translate to novel domains (with no pre-existing data).\n\nWe thank you again for the thoughtful response.

We provide responses below, and additional examples in the global response.\n\n> Can you report numbers measuring problem difficulty as length of proofs? Can you include examples of proofs found over iterations?\n\nPlease refer to the global response for numbers on the proof length per iteration. We also included a few examples of proofs with the lowest log-probs found during training (proofs found on average get longer).\n\n> How often does the conjecturer produce ""trivial"" conjectures? Do you have any measure as to how sound the completion engine is as iterations proceed? I imagine that the first round of conjectures is entirely random given the model is untrained. Can you include examples of conjectures produced over the iterations?\n\nAt first, most of the conjectures that are successfully proved are trivial (we analyzed provability in Appendix C), and many are trivially false (e.g. \'!!false\' in propositional logic). Hindsight replay allows the agent to uncover non-trivial conjectures and learn. We refer to the global response for concrete examples of conjectures.\n\n> It seems unclear whether this sort of learning in multiple phases is better than just performing one single phase, like in AlphaGeometry. [...] Perhaps upfront training may be better? Can the authors comment on this?\n\nGood question! Earlier in the project, we did consider trying something like the AlphaGeometry approach. There are two main challenges for this. One is that, in AlphaGeometry, problems and solutions are simultaneously generated in the forward direction only, both simultaneously, by creating new hypotheses and applying forward deduction. While that works for the Euclidean geometry axioms, it does not generalize easily to a general formal system like dependent type theory. As an example of where it becomes hard, in arithmetic, our conjecturer generates several statements that are then proved by induction (as it is likely to generate something equivalent to forall (\'n : nat), …). For these conjectures to be produced in the forward direction, like in AlphaGeometry, we would need to independently stumble upon proofs of matching base and inductive cases without actually planning to do so. It\'s also not entirely clear how the proof of the inductive case would be generated in the forward direction, without having a goal. The other challenge is that AlphaGeometry also relied on an existing, complete, domain-specific deductive closure solver for Geometry to generate data, which our approach for data generation doesn\'t require (and which doesn\'t exist for dependent type theory, given that the deductive closure can be infinite).\n\n> On page 22, Is the supplied full proof for a_succ_add exactly that found by the proof search? [...] does the Peano language automatically enumerate all relevant types and reachable hypotheses?\n\nWe reconstruct the proof in Peano concrete syntax from the proof search tree as it is found (to get the equivalent proof as if human-written), though at each step the model gets the proof state, current goal, and only chooses the next step. But you are correct, Peano enumerates the relevant types and reachable hypotheses. So for \'intro\', which takes the next universally quantified variable from the goal into the state, it suffices for the model to choose \'intro\' as an action, as the rest is forced (both the name - we just generate a numbered identifier, and its type is taken from the goal by Peano). For \'eq_symm\', eq_symm can be applied to any equality currently in the state, so Peano will enumerate those (not with a particular algorithm for eq_symm, just looking at the type signature of eq_symm). So in this case the policy first chooses \'eq_symm\', then chooses one of the valid results to get from it in the current state.\n\n> The performance of the last checkpoint compared to the initial checkpoint on the propositional logic extrinsic set is not very different, can you comment on why this might be the case?\n\nGiven that our agent is only trained on its own self-generated problems, there is no a priori guarantee that it gets better at solving human-written problems, which are only a very small subset of what is formally true (one open problem is how to characterize this subset that we find interesting, to focus discovery on it). Looking at the conjectures generated and proved by our agent, it is clear that they do not generally resemble human theorems. (see examples in the global response)\n\nThus, our extrinsic set served just to give a signal of whether there is some intersection between where the improvements take place and the set of problems that are interesting to humans. We observe some improvement, although it is still small in absolute terms, as you point out. We think a really interesting and important problem that this suggests is exactly how to structure the learning process so that the conjectures evolve in better alignment with theorems that are interesting for humans. Our setup can serve as a starting point for this investigation.\n\n> Sampling conjectures from a small model should be fairly quick. Can the authors comment on how much time is spent generating conjectures and proving conjectures separately? Only the aggregated number is reported in the appendix section A.\n\nYou are correct, conjecture generation in each iteration is fairly quick. Sampling 200 new, unique conjectures takes 1-3 minutes in each iteration, whereas proof search on 200 conjectures takes 2-4 hours of compute (which our implementation distributes across several prover processes, since proof attempts in each batch are independent). Sampling is mostly GPU-bound, while proof search also spends measurable time on Peano enumerating actions during MCTS, especially in deep states where the state can get large.\n\nThank you again for the detailed review.

We agree that several of the clarifications you requested should be addressed in the paper, and will do so (including the additional examples in the global response).\n\n> There is a substantial body of work on the self-improvement of LLMs that I felt was not adequately addressed by the authors.\n\nWe agree. Some prior work has also focused on self-improvement on informal math (eg GSM8k), which is also relevant, though none that we know of do it for FTP or without pre-training data. We will acknowledge this literature and add references accordingly.\n\n> MCTS was a bit light on detail. What exactly is the state for the MCTS policy? [...]\n\nThis makes sense, we will include concrete examples of states and MCTS expansions in the Appendix. The state in Peano has the same form as the proof state in the interactive modes of Coq and Lean – a set of objects with their types, and a goal type. We just represent it as a string to feed to the Transformer model, so nothing Peano-specific in what the LLM does. One random example:\n\n""State: { x : G, x0 : G }\\nGoal: [(\'a2 : G) -> (= (op id \'a2) \'a2)]""\n(the state has two elements of the group G and still has a \'forall a2 : G, id * a2 = a2\' in the goal)\n\nThe proof search method we use is broadly similar to the instantiations of MCTS is used in recent prior work like in gpt-f or Holophrasm. The main difference is that, since Peano has a finite action space, we don\'t sample the action as a sequence of tokens from the policy, but rather just score the enumerated actions using the LM. Other search algorithms, like HTPS, can well be used in our setup as well instead.\n\n> To the previous point - [...] discussion regarding if and how their approach could extend to popular theorem proving environments like Coq and Lean\n\nYes, good question! Peano\'s typing rules are essentially a subset of Lean\'s and Coq\'s (CoC vs CIC, with variations), and its simplicity makes it more appropriate to do proof search in it. It would be relatively simple to develop a Peano -> Lean proof object translator, that takes proof objects found in Peano and generates the equivalent Lean proof object. The opposite direction would take more engineering work, but is also possible (the additional complexity of the Lean type system makes it much more convenient for users, but is not fundamentally required to represent mathematics). Thus, to make our approach available in Lean (for instance), the shortest path is likely to be something like the recent Duper (https://github.com/leanprover-community/duper), which takes the problem in Lean, translates it to the external prover, calls the prover, and then attempts to reconstruct the proof in Lean. We think Peano\'s more minimal type system makes it suitable to investigate how to get the self-improving agent to eventually build towards much deeper theorems (making new definitions and a library on the way), and at the point where that works it will pay off to spend the engineering effort to build proof object translators.\n\n> Is there a qualitative analysis for RQ1 that can be done on these conjectures to show that they indeed become harder over time?\n\nPlease refer to the global response for examples of conjectures that show up during training. We will include those (for all 3 domains) in the Appendix. Overall, we see both the longest proofs that the agent is capable of finding getting longer, as well as the hardest conjectures being more complex. Since the agent still doesn\'t make new definitions or reuse past lemmas, the conjectures however don\'t yet evolve in complexity in a human-like way, which we believe to be an extremely interesting direction for future work that our setup can be used to explore.\n\n> Later iterations of the policy seem to be a bit worse on (or consider a bit harder) ""easy"" conjectures\n\nThat\'s true, we do seem to observe a distribution drift over time in terms of conjectures. As the conjecturer starts to focus on hard ones (which in this case, since the agent doesn\'t make up new definitions to shorten higher-level statements, tends to mean longer conjectures), the policy seems to be slightly more uncertain in easier problems than the policy at iterations 1-2 (which have been trained more recently on easier conjectures). Yes, we believe a curriculum-style approach could be useful to mitigate this behavior. However, in terms of proof search, this uncertainty tends to not be that much of a problem in easier conjectures because they have either shorter proofs or lower branching factor (thus, MCTS still finds the proof even if the agent prioritizes other branches at first).\n\n> Why do we start with a randomly initialized LM? How does the choice of LM affect performance?\n\nOur main goal is to build towards a self-improving pipeline that does not require pre-training data, much like AlphaZero did for board games. If this is achieved, then our agent will be able to produce mathematics in both existing domains for which we have plentiful training data, and for novel domains for which we do not. For the LM, we chose a standard GPT-2-based Transformer architecture, but we don\'t believe this is crucial to the idea, as work in LLMs generally show that scale and data matter more than architecture details (sticking to Transformers specifically).\n\n> [...] how the approach chooses a specific difficulty of conjecture generator.\n\nWe always try to generate hard conjectures. Here, ""try"" means that we condition the Transformer on the \'hard\' difficulty. After proof search on a batch of samples, we get the actual observed difficulty by whether the prover succeeded and, if so, the log-probability of the proof under the current LM. That feedback signal is then used to further train the conjecturer (by generating LM training examples where the conjecture\'s statement is paired with the observed difficulty, rather than always \'hard\').\n\nThanks again for the review.

We provide clarifications below, and would be happy to answer any questions that remain.\n\n> Further justification of using log-likelihood as the main evaluation in this paper.\n\n- It can be seen as a sort of continuous version of the success rate. We found that the more likely the proof is under a policy, the faster MCTS reaches it. Thus, whether MCTS finds it within the budget depends on the search cut-off, whereas the likelihood doesn\'t (even two policies that both fail, or both succeed, on the same problem can still be differentiated by the likelihood).\n- Although closely related, it is much faster to compute. While proof search can take 1-4 minutes depending on the problem and with the search budget we used, the likelihood can be computed in a second. This makes larger scale analyses feasible, such as the one in Figure 3 (> 50k proof-policy evaluations).\n\n> How does this method facilitates solving dataset such as miniF2F and mathlib?\n\nWe emphasize that the focus of our contribution was mathematical discovery and self-improvement, starting only from axioms, but crucially no pre-training data. This is fundamentally different from approaches that rely on massive pre-training on existing problems, which is common to the methods typically evaluated on mathlib or minif2f. While we hope that agents trained in a setup like ours will eventually be able to rediscover much of mathlib and solve problems from minif2f, there are still scalability challenges that require further research (such as in accumulating a library, discussed above). If those are overcame, then this would be one path to impacting those benchmarks. Another path would be to investigate a setup similar to what we propose, but starting with a pre-trained LLM. Conjecturing can help expand the existing training data, and potentially improve performance on the benchmarks. However, it\'s still unclear whether this would generalize to domains beyond those seen in pre-training, such as those already on mathlib. Our goal was to not have this dependency.\n\n> Q1: How to guarantee f_C soundness and completeness?\n\nCompleteness is given by the fact that the completion engine expansion rules (L193-201) consider all of the typing rules in Peano (which are few). Thus, given any valid conjecture c, the choices that have to be made to generate c have to fall in one of these cases. Soundness relies on the soundness of unification in Peano, but is basically the fact that at each step we either directly give out an object from the context from the desired type (which is sound), or give the result of a function that Peano believes can produce the desired type (by unifying the type with the result type of the function). \n\n> Q2: In Figure 2, propositional logic, the search baseline policy at iteration 0 seems missing.\n\nIt is there, but almost coincides with iteration 1. We generally found little improvement in the policy in propositional logic after a single iteration, but it starts to pick up later.\n\n> Q3: According to Appendix B and Figure 5, the authors use the likelihood of the proof under the policy as a measure of difficulty. To what extent is the distinction of the difficulty between the log-likelihood of -13 and -1? Could you please provide some cases for each? \n\nPlease refer to the global response for additional examples in each domain with their likelihoods. We will include these in the appendix.\n\n> Q4: Figure 2 shows diminishing gains in conjecture and policy iteration 4. Does it mean approaching the saturated performance? How to decide the number of iterations?\n\nYes, the policies start to converge at that point. We believe that this is due to the main limitation we highlighted in Section 5: our agent still can\'t come up with new definitions, or reuse past theorems. As a result, the way the agent finds to produce harder conjectures is to make the statements more convoluted. But in human mathematics, even deep, interesting theorems tend to have short statements (posed in terms of the right high-level definitions). Our main contribution is to set up a self-improvement pipeline where future work can tackle the open problem of understanding how to build towards ""interesting"" deeper theorems. If this is achieved, then in principle there would be no limit to how many iterations one could run for, as the agent would be able to keep raising the level of abstraction of the theorems it discovers (which our current agent does not yet do).\n\n> Q5: How many evaluated theorems are in the Natural Number Game dataset?\n\nThe whole game (in the website) contains 83 unique theorems. Since in its current form our method doesn\'t yet accumulate a library with its previously proved theorems, it can only plausibly prove the levels that only refer to the axioms (rather than previous lemmas), which leaves 10 theorems spread across the first 3 ""worlds"" in the game (Tutorial, Addition, Multiplication). We included all these problems in Appendix E.\n\nThank you again for the comments and questions!

We provide clarifications below, and would be happy to answer any questions that remain.\n\n> How the conjecture generation is conditioned on the difficulty level?\n\nOnce we attempt to prove a conjecture, we obtain a difficulty evaluation (failed, easy or hard, where easy and hard are relative to the batch of conjectures that were attempted). Using this feedback, we then generate training examples (strings) where the difficulty comes first, followed by the statement of the conjecture. For example (examples generated from the first conjecturing iteration of a run on propositional logic, after running proof search on this batch):\n\n```\n""Conj:(fail) false""\n""Conj:(triv) (iff (not (not (not false))) false)""\n""Conj:(hard) [(\'a0 : (or false false)) -> false]""\n```\n\nAll these conjectures were first sampled by conditioning on ""Conj:(hard) "" (the conjecturer starts untrained, so initially that doesn\'t mean anything to it). Then, after training on the strings above, in addition to the examples from proof search, we sample again the next batch of conjectures.\n\n> How do you tokenize formulas?\n\nWe used character-level tokenization. Since we assumed no initial data to train a BPE tokenizer, we found this to be the simplest, more general choice.\n\n> How exactly do you calculate the average proof log-likelihood (Figure 2):\n\nA proof p corresponds to a sequence a_1, …, a_n of actions in the search tree. For the proof log-likelihood, we average the log-likelihood of each action being taken at the corresponding state. So if the starting state is s_0, that is the average of log p(a_1 | s_0), log p(a_2 | s_1), and so on. Each s_k is obtained by taking the action in the proof from the previous state. Each of these probabilities is a readout from the policy LM. The closer this probability is to 1, the more likely is this proof for the LM; correspondingly, the faster MCTS will explore these paths and find this proof during proof search.\n\n> how do you incorporate the failed proof attempts into the average?\n\nIn Figure 2 we only analyze conjectures that were proved (4.1, L302). We cannot compute the likelihood above if we indeed find a proof (since p appears in the formula). However, given one proof, we can evaluate its likelihood under any policy, even if previous policies assign much lower likelihood to it (and thus would take longer search, or time out, in finding it). We show and discuss the fraction of proved conjectures at each iteration in Appendix C.\n\n> what is the set of conjectures you compute the average for: is it across a new batch of 200 conjectures, or the old ones (which were used for training the prover) are also used?\n\nOnly new conjectures that were proposed at each iteration. They are guaranteed to be (at least syntactically) different from previous ones, since we reject samples that have been seen in the past.\n\n> are the conjectures from hindsight relabeling taken into the average here?\n\nNo, only the conjectures in the batch are.\n\n> Is it correct that the lines in Fig. 2, right, for the policies from iterations 0 and 1 are completely overlapping?\n\nThat\'s right, they were nearly indistinguishable. \n\n> Why do you display the proof log-likelihood instead of perhaps more interpretable metrics like the proving success rate for a batch of new conjectures or the average length of a proof search / a proof size?\n\nThere are two main reasons for using the likelihood compared to success rate:\n- It can be seen as a sort of continuous version of the success rate. We found that the more likely the proof is under a policy, the faster MCTS reaches it. Thus, whether MCTS finds it within the budget depends on the search cut-off, whereas the likelihood doesn\'t (even two policies that both fail, or both succeed, on the same problem can still be differentiated by the likelihood).\n- Although closely related, it is much faster to compute. While proof search can take 1-4 minutes depending on the problem and with the search budget we used, the likelihood can be computed in a second. This makes larger scale analyses feasible, such as the one in Figure 3 (> 50k proof-policy evaluations).\n\n> Compared to proof size, the main advantage is that the likelihood takes into account the branching factor. There are long proofs that are nonetheless easy because there aren\'t many options at each step (e.g., most are \'intro\').\nIs the success rate in Fig. 4 computed independently per each iteration, or rather cumulatively (taking union of theorems proved in all the past iterations)?\n\nIndependently.\n\n> Could you provide a list of requirements to create a Python environment for running the supplemented code?

This restriction to essentially ""cut-free"" proofs could become a significant bottleneck as the complexity of the target domain increases.\n\nThat\'s correct, we acknowledge this current limitation in the paper. We note that accumulating a library by itself is not technically challenging – the main open research problem here is to determine what theorems are worth adding to the library. This might require some metric for the interestingness, or usefulness, of a theorem. These are important but still understudied topics in mathematical discovery, as most current work on AI for mathematics only focuses on solving a target set of problems, not discovering new theorems autonomously. Our work sets up an experimental foundation for future work to explore these metrics and empirically observe what libraries they end up discovering.  \n\n> The paper doesn\'t show how this new way compares to other neural ATP methods. This makes it hard to know how good it really is.\n\nOur work contributes both a new problem setting where an agent bootstraps itself from only the axioms of a domain, and a pipeline for learning in this setting. One of the components of this pipeline is the prover (ATP) agent, but the pipeline is agnostic to the specific neural ATP method that the prover employs. Our specific ATP is most similar to Holophrasm [1], using MCTS with learned value and policies, as has become standard since then. But any other proof search method from prior work, like HTPS, could also work with our pipeline, complementing the other components (conjecturing, and the outer learning loop). Thus, our pipeline is not a direct competitor to other neural ATP methods, but rather a novel method for bootstrapping one using no pre-existing training data. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first to learn entirely from self-generated conjectures, without requiring human training data. This is our main contribution.\n\n> Did the authors consider evaluating the system on widely-used benchmarks like mathlib or mini-f2f? If not, what are the main challenges in adapting the approach to these benchmarks?\n\nWe emphasize that the focus of our contribution was mathematical discovery and self-improvement, jointly learning to conjecture and prove theorems starting only from axioms, but crucially no pre-training data. This is fundamentally different from approaches that rely on massive pre-training on existing problems, which is common to the methods typically evaluated on mathlib or minif2f. \nWhile we hope that agents trained in a setup like ours will eventually be able to rediscover much of mathlib and solve problems from minif2f, there are still scalability challenges that require further research (such as in accumulating a library, discussed above) before benchmarks like minif2f become within reach. However, if we can overcome those challenges, our approach in principle can work in new mathematical domains, whereas it\'s still not clear how methods that require massive pre-training to do well will be capable of that generalization.\n\n> How well does an agent trained in one mathematical domain (e.g., propositional logic) generalize to another (e.g., arithmetic)?\n\nWe attempted to initialize an agent for one domain using the last checkpoint of another to evaluate transfer, but did not observe any improvements. We will note this in the appendix. We believe that this is just due to overfitting, since the three domains we tested are very different from each other (for instance, axiom names, types, etc, are all different, thus completely unseen when the agent starts in the new domain). We believe that bootstrapping on a significantly wider spanning set of domains, coupled with library learning, might be enough to observe transfer.\n\nWe also note that we provided more examples of conjectures and proofs in the global response.\n\nThanks again for the review!

In this paper, the extra training data produced from hindsight relabeling is crucial, they indicate on line 336 that the approach does not reach its intended goal without it. Perhaps upfront training may be better? It could be the case that by placing a somewhat more complex distribution on the constrained decoding, one can generate many harder yet valid conjectures without learning a transformer first.

Similarly does the model produce ""intro x1 : (= (+ (s x) x0) (s (+ x x0)))"" or just ""intro x1"".\nIf the case of the former, does the Peano language automatically enumerate all relevant types and reachable hypotheses? Otherwise generating a type like ""(= (+ (s x) x0) (s (+ x x0))"" might make the action space infinite?\n\n5.

However, open questions remain about the methods (how), domains (where), people (who) and objectives (to what end) of feedback processes. To navigate these questions, we introduce PRISM, a new dataset which maps the sociodemographics and stated preferences of 1,500 diverse participants from 75 countries, to their contextual preferences and fine-grained feedback in 8,011 live conversations with 21 LLMs. With PRISM, we contribute (i) wider geographic and demographic participation in feedback; (ii) census-representative samples for two countries (UK, US); and (iii) individualised ratings that link to detailed participant profiles, permitting personalisation and attribution of sample artefacts. We target subjective and multicultural perspectives on value-laden and controversial issues, where we expect interpersonal and cross-cultural disagreement. We use PRISM in three case studies to demonstrate the need for careful consideration of which humans provide alignment data.",Oral Session 1B: Human-AI Interaction,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16019,https://openreview.net/forum?id=DFr5hteojx,DFr5hteojx,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (Oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Meta review of The PRISM Alignment Dataset: What Participatory, Representative and Individualised Human Feedback Reveals About the Subjective and Multicultural Alignment of Large Language Models\nNeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track Submission 1310\n\nThis is the highest-rated paper in my meta-review batch.

We built this dataset for the research community and it’s very rewarding to receive such glowing praise from a NeurIPs reviewer. Thank you.\n\nWe will now respond to your comments one-by-one.\n\n---\n\n## C1: Subjective paradigm \nWe appreciate your comment on whether PRISM is grounded in the subjective paradigm. We think there are two points here:\n1. Clarity over what we mean by “operate in subjective paradigm”\n2. Leakage from the different conversation type treatments.\n\n### C1a: Defining “subjective”\nOur use of the phrase “operate in the subjective paradigm” (L49) is not intended to imply that all entries in the dataset are on subjective topics or tasks. Instead, we operate in the subjective (or descriptive) paradigm (see [1,2]) because we do not provide guidelines or instructions for what behaviours are optimal in LLMs nor specify how participants should form preferences over their outputs. This is in contrast to e.g., Anthropic HHH, WebGPT and other previous preference datasets [2], where annotators are instructed to rate examples based on a specific property, like helpfulness or informativeness. The subjectivity over which behaviours are characteristic of an aligned LLM is a meta level property of the dataset, as well as a prompt-by-prompt property (for some conversations).\n\n[1] https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.13/\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02457\n\n**Action**: We will expand a point on this in the intro with the extra space for camera ready.\n\n###\xa0C1b: Leakage and correspondence between subjectivity-conversation type\nYou are absolutely correct in noticing that the values- and controversy- guided conversations are likely to contain subjective topics than the more neutral unguided baseline. You also find that empirically this is true (by filtering to only values and controversy conditions). Thanks for doing this investigation!\n\nHowever, there was not intended to be a 1:1 correspondence in this way between the __conversation type__ and its __degree of subjectivity__. For example, an unguided baseline could be “what’s the most delicious dessert”? This does not have a single objective response. It is hard to create such a mapping in the first place, and challenging to do a manual annotation exercise to label instances as either objective or subjective (in binary) because there is a spectrum between objectivity and subjectivity (as we mention in L48).\n\nFinally, the conversation types were intended as priming devices to encourage each participant to cover a wide range of diverse topics. We did not enforce that their prompts actually correspond to the type selection. However, as our regression analysis demonstrated, the priming device successfully split the dataset into various distinct portions. Despite this high association between type and topic, there will of course still be some leakage (as you note) which we do not correct for.\n\n**Action:** We can improve and clarify the discussion of this in the camera-ready version, as some of it was lost in translation while shortening text for submission.\n\n---\n\n## C2: Figure Readability and Captions\nWe acknowledge some readability concerns from the submitted version of the paper and will address these for camera-ready.\n\n**Actions:** We will make the following adjustments to improve Fig 4.\n1. Bigger size in the main body which allows the details (edges) to be more spread out and easier to read. Extra space means we can also spread out the subplot panels for greater readability. We can also add a full-page expanded version of the model ranks in Fig 4 in the appendix.\n2. Additional explanation for how to interpret the figures in their captions so you do not need to go to different parts of the main body text for core takeaways.\n3. We can experiment with the colours. The palette is from Crameri et al., (https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps/) which somewhat limits the choice but every palette is intended to be accessible (e.g., for colorblindness) and well-reproduced in various settings. We want to keep using these palettes for those reasons.\n\n---\n\n## C3: Limitations and literature on LLM-given labels\nGood point regarding the potential biases from using GPT-4 as a labeller of topic cluster names. \n\n**Actions**: We will add this into Fig 3 caption, or main body text. We will also add references and comments on the personas/LLM-as-a-judge literature.

Bigger size in the main body which allows the details to be more spread out and easier to read. Extra space means we can also spread out the subplot panels for greater readability. We can also add a full-page expanded version of the model ranks in Fig 4 to the appendix.\n2. Additional explanation for how to interpret the figures in their captions so you do not need to go to different parts of the main body text for core takeaways.\n3. We can experiment with the colours, but we do already use a colorblind-friendly palette. The palette is from Crameri et al., (https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps/) which somewhat limits the choice but every palette is intended to be accessible (e.g., for colorblindness) and well-reproduced in various settings.\n\n---\n\n## C2: Semantically Identical Prompts\nWe appreciate the reviewer’s interest in more detail on the semantic-identical prompts (in L198-200). Luckily, we already have plenty of analysis and empirical depth on this sentence in the appendix (pages 76-81), so it will be very convenient for us to fulfil your request.\n\n**Action:** We will add a discussion of our existing results and analyses in the main paper with extra space for camera ready.\n\n---\n\n##\xa0C3: Additional Method Questions\nThe reviewer asked for two additional clarification points on our method:\n1. Are state preferences also captured after phase 2 ? I think it would be interesting to see how the stated preferences change after interactions with LLMs\n2. How are the value-laden and controversial statements/topics chosen ?\n\n### C3a: Stated preferences\nRegarding Q1, we collected stated preferences in the survey before participants interact with LLMs. This involves rating various statements along fine-grained dimensions about the importance of general behaviours in AI language models (not pertaining to a specific conversation). At the end of each conversation in phase 2, we collect analogous fine-grained dimensions statements about behaviours within a specific conversation. This is explained in the paragraph on stated preferences (starting at L87) and the paragraph about fine-grained (starting at L136). It is visually communicated and explained in Figure 2.\n\nSo, if the reviewer is asking whether we collect the same fine-grained questions after interactions with the LLMs, then the answer is “yes”. We collect these mapping statements (along the same fine-grained dimensions) precisely so one can examine whether “local” interactions with the LLM changes the “global” preferences stated prior to any interactions.\n\nIf instead the reviewer is asking whether we repeated the survey or part of the survey after a participant finished all of their conversations, then the answer is “no”. We do not repeat the survey. This was already a time-consuming and cognitively demanding task for our participants so we did not add an exit survey as an additional element.\n\n**Action**: We will add a statement to clarify this question in the camera-ready version.\n\n### C3b: Topic choice\nRegarding Q2, we (as authors or researchers) did not choose any of the topics or statements for inclusion in the dataset. The participants could freely choose the topics or prompts in their conversations. We put no restrictions on topic choice and provided very little guidance in order to not bias or nudge the participants towards certain topics.\n\nThis is mentioned in Sec 2.2. and in the caption of Figure 1 (“Participants then progress to Stage 2, where they converse with LLMs on topics of their choosing”). The topics you see, for example in Fig 3, are based on an unsupervised clustering pipeline (as explained in Section 3.1).\n\n**Action**: The free choice of prompts and topics of conversation by participants (not based on guidance or instructions of researchers) was a key design motivation of the dataset. So, we will make that abundantly clear with extra sentences in the additional space of the camera-ready version.\n\n---\n\n**We hope that the above provides clarification on the points raised by the reviewer and that they might consider reflecting this in their updated score.**'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Hello reviewer zHUk,\n\nThank you for your review and strong score - we really appreciate your comments on our “interesting and “rich” dataset enabling lots of follow-up studies and are pleased that you found this paper “very well written” along with insightful and extensive analyses.\n\nWe will now respond to your minor concerns one-by-one.\n\n---\n\n## C1: “Participatory” as a term\nWe agree with the concern that “participatory” has many disputed meanings and is a term at risk of being used in participation-washing contexts in ML and AI communities (as Sloane et al., and Birhane et al., discuss, both referenced in L319). We have an expanded discussion of these nuances of “participation” in L1316. \n\nIn our context, we use ""participatory"" to describe an evaluation process that prioritizes input from local citizens with specialised, individualised knowledge of their own and their communities\' needs. We do not claim our work to be a full “participatory action research” methodology. \n\nHowever, compared to “passive” participation in data annotation tasks (as you mention) or even more passive participation in pre-training datasets (as Birhane et al., discuss), our process is more active and agentic for participants because it foregrounds the opportunity to provide their feedback, opinions and preferences, not just labels. Participatory also signals our goal to have communities more involved in the alignment fine-tuning of models: we do not fully achieve that in this paper, but see this as a first step demonstrating the need.\n\nFurthermore, we attempted to mitigate some power imbalances (although they remain skewed towards researchers) by communicating to participants that (i) this effort was about making more diverse feedback available in a resource for LLM development, (ii) that there were no wrong or right answers, and (iii) by opting to not provide any guidelines dictating how they should respond to or label data. \n\nOur method (and use of “participatory”) thus aligns more closely with participatory data collection practices in social sciences, where surveys can be considered valid participatory tools if they target opinions, attitudes, and preferences; and is therefore distinct to data annotation practices that Birhane et al., and Sloane et al., both centre in their discussion.\n\n**Action**: We will add a mention of this to the Introduction and expand our discussion in the Limitations by bringing some of the content in the appendix (L1316) to the main paper.\n\n---\n\n##\xa0C2: Additional references\n**Action**: We will add Gooding and Mansoo (2023) to our related works section.

""\n\nI am not entirely sure I agree with this sentiment that PRISM lies solely in the subjective paradigm.

I performed a quick analysis using GPT-4o where I asked the model to filter the dataset to only questions that would have a subjective answer (A task that should in nature be relatively trivial) and I was left with approx. 3.9k opening prompts. Filtering to values guided and controversy guided still results in a number of non-subjective questions (I do not have exact figures, but a manual review was approx. ~3/100). This is after using the correctly balanced dataset, as pointed out in appendix k. Obviously this is probably an unavoidable problem, and the authors have taken *significant* effort to mitigate this I would just have preferred perhaps a more thorough discussion on manual review (unless they did this and its buried *deep* in the appendix in which case I apologize to the authors).

However, most of the current VQA datasets and models are primarily focused on English and a few major world languages, with images that are Western-centric. While recent efforts have tried to increase the number of languages covered on VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. More importantly, some datasets extend the text to other languages, either via translation or some other approaches, but usually keep the same images, resulting in narrow cultural representation. To address these limitations, we create CVQA, a new Culturally-diverse Multilingual Visual Question Answering benchmark dataset, designed to cover a rich set of languages and regions, where we engage native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. CVQA includes culturally-driven images and questions from across 28 countries in four continents, covering 26 languages with 11 scripts, providing a total of 9k questions. We benchmark several Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on CVQA, and we show that the dataset is challenging for the current state-of-the-art models. This benchmark will serve as a probing evaluation suite for assessing the cultural bias of multimodal models and hopefully encourage more research efforts towards increasing cultural awareness and linguistic diversity in this field.",Oral Session 4A: Natural Language Processing,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05967,https://openreview.net/forum?id=E18kRXTGmV,E18kRXTGmV,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (Oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'This is an original and potentially impactful paper in which the authors address the problem of reducing the dominance of Western culture in current datasets by creating a novel Culturally-diverse multi-lingual Visual Question Answering dataset (CVQA).

We appreciate your insights and will address your comments as follows:\n\n**1. Multiple-choice task limitations:**\nWe acknowledge your concern about the simplicity of the 4-way multiple-choice task. While it serves as an accessible starting point, we agree that it may not fully drive progress towards truly culturally-inclusive MLLMs. During the creation of our CVQA dataset, we made sure that CVQA is also convertible into free-text open-ended QA - see line 125. We also conducted experiments examining the performance of MLLMs without option list in the input (free-generation QA), see line 255-266.  We'll also discuss future work directions that could involve more complex evaluation metrics, such as those proposed by Manas et al. (AAAI 2024) for measuring semantic similarity in generated answers.\n\n**2. Option ordering robustness:**\nWe appreciate this observation. We have already shuffled the options in the original dataset to make sure that the option order is random. We will conduct an ablation study on option ordering and include the results in the paper, providing insights into the robustness of our benchmark to this factor.\n\n**3. Annotator training and quality control:**\nWe will provide more details on the annotator training process, including any additional quality control measures beyond the initial validation. We have conducted further quality checks by several iterations to ensure the quality of the annotations and that they follow the initial guidelines of this project, which are performed by the core contributors of this project.\n\n**4. Justification for CLIP and mCLIP:**\nWe included CLIP and mCLIP as simple yet strong embedding-based baselines to provide a comparison point for more complex VQA models. While they are not full VQA models, their performance on this task offers valuable insights into the cross-modal understanding capabilities of widely-used vision-language models. In the revised paper, we will clarify their role as baselines and discuss how their performance compares to more specialized VQA models, highlighting the strengths and limitations of embedding-based approaches in culturally diverse contexts.\n\n**5. Closed-source model analyses:**\nWe will try to extend all analyses to include Gemini and GPT4o and explain any limitations of these models.\n\n**6. Dataset license and annotator compensation:**\nWe can confirm that all images from public sources are under Creative Commons license and are at least permitted for research use. We will add more detailed information about the dataset's license. As this is a community-driven research project, we offered authorship as compensation for contributors rather than monetary compensation. This provides valuable academic credit.

More qualitative examples:**\nWe agree that including more examples would enhance the paper. We will add a new figure with diverse examples from the dataset, showcasing various languages, cultures, and question types.

However, most of the current VQA datasets and models are primarily focused on English and a few major world languages, with images that are Western-centric. While recent efforts have tried to increase the number of languages covered on VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. More importantly, some datasets extend the text to other languages, either via translation or some other approaches, but usually keep the same images, resulting in narrow cultural representation. To address these limitations, we create CVQA, a new Culturally-diverse Multilingual Visual Question Answering benchmark dataset, designed to cover a rich set of languages and regions, where we engage native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. CVQA includes culturally-driven images and questions from across 28 countries in four continents, covering 26 languages with 11 scripts, providing a total of 9k questions. We benchmark several Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on CVQA, and we show that the dataset is challenging for the current state-of-the-art models.

Current large-scale math instruction tuning datasets such as MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2024) and MAmmoTH (Yue et al., 2024) are constructed using outputs from closed-source LLMs with commercially restrictive licenses. A key reason limiting the use of open-source LLMs in these data generation pipelines has been the wide gap between the mathematical skills of the best closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, and the best open-source LLMs. Building on the recent progress in open-source LLMs, our proposed prompting novelty, and some brute-force scaling, we construct OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs. The dataset is constructed by synthesizing code-interpreter solutions for GSM8K and MATH, two popular math reasoning benchmarks, using the recently released and permissively licensed Mixtral model. Our best model, OpenMath-CodeLlama-70B, trained on a subset of OpenMathInstruct-1, achieves a score of 84.6% on GSM8K and 50.7% on MATH, which is competitive with the best gpt-distilled models. We will release our code, models, and the OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset under a commercially permissive license.","Oral Session 4C: Diffusion-based Models, Mathematics",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10176,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Mbd3QxXjq5,Mbd3QxXjq5,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (Oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'The paper presents OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs.\n\nPros:\n1.

The analysis part is not super convincing.\n\nWe would appreciate it if the reviewer could point out any missing ablations in our studies. Our ablations presented in Section 4.1 currently address: (a) a comparison of our proposed fair downsampling with naive downsampling, (b) a comparison of our proposed masked prompting vs. default prompting strategy, (c) the impact of preferring code solutions, and (d) the the effect of subject-wise prompting vs. default prompting for MATH. Due to space constraints, we present additional analysis in Appendix A, which includes the impact of data scaling and error analysis of our fine-tuned models.  \n\n> It is not clear how to remove the incorrectness in the generated dataset. \n\nWe developed heuristics to filter out *syntactically noisy* solutions which are presented in Section 2.3. Anecdotally, we find false positive solutions, i.e., ones using the wrong reasoning chain to arrive at the right answer, are rare in our dataset. Automatic identification of these *semantically noisy* solutions can be done via LLM as a judge or reward models. We plan to explore these techniques in future work. \n\n> The inconsistency of performance changes (increase on one dataset and decrease or no changes on others) indicates that the models learn superficial features instead of deeper math-related knowledge from the generated dataset.\n\nGiven the distributional differences between the datasets, a perfect performance sync across all of them is very difficult in practice. For example, GSM8K is a grade-school dataset, while MATH is a much harder high-school competition dataset. That said, the model performances on GSM8K and MATH have a high Spearman correlation with the out-of-domain datasets presented in this paper, namely GSM-Hard, SVAMP, TabMWP, ASDiv, and MAWPS, as shown below.\n\n| OOD Datasets   | Correlation with MATH performance | Correlation with GSM8K performance |\n|----------|---------|---------|\n| GSM-Hard | 0.89    | 0.94    |\n| SVAMP    | 0.77    | 0.89    |\n| TabMWP   | 0.71    | 0.89    |\n| ASDiv    | 0.81    | 0.93    |\n| MAWPS    | 0.71    | 0.89    |\n\n\nGiven these strong correlations, we believe models are not merely learning superficial math-related features.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for their positive feedback.

I think this is a worthwhile and valuable direction to explore.\n\nWe believe many of the components developed in this paper can also be adapted to generate synthetic data for other domains. The tricky part is that, unlike mathematics, filtering data can require a more involved pipeline. LLM-based judgment and heuristics can serve as a proxy to curate the synthetic data at scale.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for their detailed review. Below is our response to the queries raised by the reviewer:\n\n> The author of this paper proposes to mask important values in the question to help the model generate complete code instead of shortcuts; it is still doubtful that a small model can understand such ""hints"" and generate useable code. For example, the author may mask 1x2=2 into AxB=C, but the model may treat the A, B, and C as actual values and hardcode them into the code, or the code may have some strange logical flow, which will cause an inconsistency or the loss of instruction-following ability. \n\nSuppose the model generates solutions with these intermediate masked-out variables copied into code. In that case, there is a very good chance that this candidate solution fails to execute/or has other errors and produces an answer that is different from the ground truth answer. Since we filter our synthetic solutions, which don\'t lead to the correct answer of the training set questions, most likely, the solutions described by the reviewer will be filtered out. We agree with the reviewer that the model can still produce false positive solution trajectories (Figure 9 in Appendix). However, it\'s unclear if the use of masked solutions in the prompt exaggerates this problem. \n\n> Case studies on how models behave after fine-tuning on the proposed dataset.\n\nUnfortunately, due to space constraints, we couldn’t include the analysis of the fine-tuned model in the main text. Appendix A.2 has details of the error analysis, and Appendix C.4 presents instances from the validation set where the analyzed fine-tuned model fails. \n\n> The finetuning prompt template is static, which may lead to prompt sensitivity in real-world scenarios.\n\nPrompt robustness remains a pain point with state-of-the-art LLMs, and we agree that this will be an issue with our fine-tuned models as well due to the use of a static template. An easy fix, whose efficacy can be explored in future work, would be to generate variants of these templates (LLMs can be used for this) and dynamically use these templates in conjunction with the QA pairs.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Review'}, 'summary_and_contributions': {'value': 'The authors construct OpenMathInstruct-1, a high-quality math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs.

In parallel work, we have shown how this data can be used for machine learning studies. Namely, we have shown its use in Transformer-based representation learning [43] and studying the alignment between machine and neural processing of multi-modal data [44]. In this work, we focus specifically on the description of our full annotation set. We agree with reviewers that there is a lot of machine learning work that remains to be done, but all of it cannot be contained in this initial presentation of the data! We believe that the dataset track is the right place to disseminate this data so that future machine learning works can continue to build on it.\n\n## References\n[43] Christopher Wang, Vighnesh Subramaniam, Adam Uri Yaari, Gabriel Kreiman, Boris Katz, Ignacio Cases, and Andrei Barbu.

For instance, is Table 4 part of the taxonomy, or is it just a further analysis beyond it?...The structure of the paper is difficult to follow. The taxonomy represents the paper\'s main contribution, and its explanation is divided into different sections. The taxonomy\'s resume needs to be consulted in the appendix.\n\nWe appreciate the feedback from the reviewer. Our taxonomy is divided into two parts: the first is documenting the challenges across the dataset lifecycle and the second is the broader landscape of fairness. For individual practitioners, our first taxonomy, which is shown in Figure 1 and Table 3, provides insights into what challenges they may face (and need to address) at different steps of the data collection process. \n\nHowever, we acknowledge that practitioners are not isolated actors; their decisions when collecting datasets are impacted by the broader environment in which they are situated. This is why we introduce our second taxonomy, which is shown in Figure 2 and Table 4. Here, we chart out the larger landscape around dataset collection, highlighting that there are challenges arising not only at the practitioner level but also from the disciplinary, organizational, regulatory, and socio-political challenges that factor into these individual decisions. Moreover, we also use this second taxonomy to point out that the recommendations we provide cannot be situated only at the individual level. This places disproportionate burden on the researcher and furthermore can fail to address the root of some issues.  \n\nTo make this clearer to the reader, we will highlight the fact that there are two parts to this taxonomy and provide additional explanation as to how these two taxonomies interact with each other. \n\n### Comparison with prior works\n> Compare the extracted conclusions with the existing works in data reporting and documentation, proposing actionable improvement in these reports, if needed... A comparison with related works on data reporting and documentation may be needed to understand this paper\'s contribution more clearly... Several works have proposed comprehensive guidelines for reporting and documenting datasets. These works, most of them cited in the paper, have overlapping conclusions, such as the ones drawn on the paper. \n\nWe thank the reviewer for this feedback. As written in the introduction, this work is intended to complement these existing works on data curation and insights from these existing works were used to help develop our interview protocol. By taking a qualitative approach and conducting semi-structured interviews, we are able to gather a “thick description” [1] of practitioner’s behaviors, or in other words, we not only understand their behaviors, which can manifest in the datasets or articles they produce, but also the context behind such behaviors. \n\nA key distinction of our work is that we consider fairness in datasets across three dimensions: the composition, the process of collecting the data, and then the release plus subsequent maintenance. While previous works [2, 3, 4] have considered these aspects in isolation, we discuss how challenges can cut across these definitions of fairness or even bring definitions in tension. For example, we include the example of P2 who wants to have a diverse set of annotators for their dataset but is unable to collect certain attributes since they might be illegal in the annotator’s country. Here, wanting to have fairness in composition (i.e., diversity of annotators) comes into conflict with having a fair or responsible data collection process. \n\n[1] Geertz.

While challenges during data curation have been widely analyzed in the related work, I do not see why the sample of practitioners provides novel and relevant insights into the problem.\n\nAs we discuss in the introduction, while previous works [1, 2, 3] have discussed challenges during data curation, these have been theoretical analyses of the problem and provided guidelines to improve data curation. In comparison to previous works, we take an empirical approach to understand how these challenges may or may not manifest on the ground for practitioners. Given the bias for only reporting positive results and the overall lack of documentation in the dataset creation process, our work sheds insight into the nuanced challenges and trade-offs dataset collectors make. Documentation of these considerations --- from the perspective of the dataset creator themselves --- typically are not included in artifacts. Thus, we are helping make this tacit knowledge more institutionalized, which benefits researchers in the future who may want to undertake similar tasks.\n\n[1] Andrews et al. “Ethical considerations for responsible data curation.” NeurIPS D&B 2023. \n\n[2] Hutchinson et al. “Towards accountability for machine learning datasets: Practices from software engineering and infrastructure.” \nFAccT 2021. \n\n[3] Jo and Gebru. “Lessons from archives: Strategies for collecting sociocultural data in machine learning.” FAccT 2020.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': '### Generalizability of Results\n> The generalizability of this work could be a potential threat due to the nature of such qualitative studies. However, the authors should indicate how quantitative analysis could build on the taxonomy constructs for validation.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this feedback and we will include in discussion of future work how quantitative analysis could complement the qualitative analysis as follows:\n1. **Systematic Literature Review:** Prior works [1, 2] have surveyed the artifacts created by dataset practitioners and provided quantitative analyses. An extension of our work could involve coding papers for mentions of these challenges. However, a significant challenge—and a key limitation of such an approach—is that discussions of challenges and negative results are often absent or underreported in published work. This absence highlights a crucial advantage of our qualitative methodology, which allows us to capture insights and difficulties that are typically overlooked or intentionally excluded from formal publications.\n\n2. **Survey of ML Dataset Creators:** Another method to bolster our qualitative research is a large-scale survey of dataset creators. For example, implementing a survey asking participants to identify which of the following challenges they have experienced to quantify their prevalence. \n\n[1] Scheuerman et al. “Do datasets have politics? Disciplinary values in computer vision dataset development.” CSCW 2021. \n\n[2] Zhao et al. “Measure Dataset Diversity, Don’t Just Claim It.” ICML 2024. \n\n### Empirical Evidence for Recommendations\n> Some recommendations lack empirical support + more empirical validation of the recommendations would be beneficial. Incorporate case studies or empirical data to support the proposed recommendations.\n\nThe recommendations provided are grounded in challenges that participants described during the interview process. For example, we recommend providing labels across different taxonomies, such as those used by Groh et al. [1], based on our interviews with P1, P2, P15, and P18 (see Sec. 2.2) who all described having to manage trade-offs when designing singular label taxonomies. Similarly, we recommended more cross-disciplinary engagement based on participants such as P29 who admitted to not knowing about explicit guidelines for fair dataset collection (Sec 3.2). We will provide more explicit grounding between our recommendations and empirical evidence from our interviews. \n\nIn the spirit of similar works published at NeurIPS D&B [2, 3], the scope of this paper is focused on identifying challenges and raising potential recommendations. A fruitful direction for future work is to design interventions for these recommendations and empirically study the effects on fair dataset collection. \n\n[1] Groh et al. “Towards Transparency in Dermatology Image Datasets with Skin Tone Annotations by Experts, Crowds, and an Algorithm.” CSCW 2022. \n\n[2] Raji et al. “AI and the Everything in the Whole Wide World Benchmark.” NeurIPS D&B 2021. \n\n[3] Peng et al. “Mitigating dataset harms requires stewardship: Lessons from 1000 papers.” NeurIPS D&B 2021.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': '### Mitigating Biases and Transparency (cont.)\n> There are no significant ethical concerns, but further detail on informed consent and data protection would enhance transparency.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview, participants were asked to provide their informed consent. They were given the option to opt-out of the interview and also told they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Participants were also asked for permission to record the study over Zoom. For data protection, each interview was transcribed from the Zoom recording and identifying details — including but not limited to names, institutions, and dataset names — were redacted from the interview transcript before the coding process. The original transcripts and recordings were deleted promptly after the interviews were redacted. Our study protocol was approved by Arizona State University’s Institutional Review Board.\n\nWhile these details are covered in Appendix A, we recognize the importance of making these processes more visible in the main text. We will include a summary of the participant recruitment and bias mitigation strategies in the main text. We will clarify these points in the camera-ready version to ensure the transparency and rigor of our research are fully communicated.\n\n### Dimensions of Fairness\n> There are no clear links between the dataset curation lifecycle and the three dimensions of fairness.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this feedback. The dimensions of fairness come into play across different stages of the curation lifecycle. Considerations around fairness in composition and process typically arise during the requirements, design, and implementation stage. Considerations around fairness in release are more concentrated in the testing and maintenance stage. Nonetheless, this is not a prescriptive delineation. For example, to ensure fairness in the process, practitioners may have to consider what annotator demographic information they want to release in case it contains sensitive information. We will clarify the links between the dimensions of fairness and the curation lifecycle in our text. \n\n\n> Unfortunately, this study did not satisfy two of the three dimensions of fairness. I don’t see how composition and process were respected/materialized.\n\nTo clarify, not all datasets seek to adhere to all three dimensions of fairness. For example, datasets containing web-scraped images, such as Fairface [1] or Racial Faces in the Wild [2], seek to have fairness in composition by having racially diverse subjects but do not prioritize fairness in process. In fact, as we point out when discussing implementation challenges, factors such as diverse data availability or collector availability can put these definitions in tension. \n\nNonetheless, to illustrate how fairness in composition and process apply to our dataset of interviews, see as follows: \n\n1. **Fairness in Process:** To ensure fairness in the process, as mentioned in Appendix A, we compensated participants $75 USD or the equivalent in their local currency for approximately 45-60 minutes of their time. This compensation rate was in the same range of prior studies [3, 4] that interviewed machine learning practitioners. We also obtained informed consent from participants and made sure it was clear that they had the right to withdraw from the study at any point. Finally, we also redact our transcripts and delete recordings immediately after transcribing to ensure data anonymity; these policies were also communicated to participants orally and in writing via an information sheet.  \n2. **Fairness in Composition:** When designing our sampling criteria, we focused on having representation across different modalities of high-dimensional, unstructured data (e.g., image and text) and role setting (e.g., academia or industry). We acknowledge that this leads to biases in the geographic distribution of our participants and encourage future research to extend our taxonomy to understanding distinct challenges that may arise from location. \n\n[1] Karkainnen and Joo et al. “Fairface: Face attribute dataset for balanced race, gender, and age for bias measurement and mitigation.” WACV 2021. \n\n[2] Wang et al. “Racial faces in the wild: Reducing racial bias by information maximization adaptation network.” ICCV 2019. \n\n[3] Sambasivan et al. “ “Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work”: Data Cascades in High-Stakes AI.” CHI 2021.\n \n[4] Boyd et al. “Datasheets for datasets help ML engineers notice and understand ethical issues in training data.” CSCW 2021.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': ""We thank the reviewer for their recognition of our taxonomy as a significant and novel contribution to the field, providing a structured framework for guiding future research and practice. We are also grateful for the acknowledgment of our paper's relevance to the broader research community, the quality of our research methodology, and the focus on ethical and social implications in dataset curation.\n\n### Mitigating Biases and Methodological Transparency\n> There is limited discussion on mitigating biases in the qualitative study. The paper could discuss potential biases in participant selection and interview responses and how they were mitigated. Provide more detail on the participant recruitment process and any steps taken to ensure diverse and representative sampling.\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer’s feedback regarding methodology transparency. In our current paper, we have included discussion on methodology in Appendix A. We agree that these details are important for ensuring the transparency and rigor of our study. If accepted, for the camera-ready version, we will provide more information on our methodology in the main-body of the text and add extended details to the Appendix.  \n\n> Can you provide more detail on how participants were selected and how potential selection biases were mitigated?\n\nAppendix A outlines the participant recruitment process, but we will include further details as follows: The initial set of participants that we reached out to were based on a review of existing machine learning datasets that were described as being more fair or less biased. From this initial set of participants, we also recruited via social media (i.e., call for participants on Twitter) and snowball sampling. To mitigate potential biases, we sampled participants to get a broad representation across dataset modality (e.g., text, image) and across industry / academia. However, as discussed in the limitations section, our participant set is still skewed primarily towards those in academia and located in the Global North. While this geographic bias is not intentional, it is also reflective of the skew towards Western perspectives and the concentration of dataset creation in certain institutions within the machine learning field [1]. \n\nThis approach was carefully designed to capture a wide range of perspectives relevant to dataset curation across different sectors, regions, and demographic backgrounds. By achieving thematic saturation, we ensured that our sample was sufficiently diverse and representative.\n\n[1] Koch et al. “Reduced, Reused and Recycled: The Life of a Dataset in Machine Learning Research.” NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks 2021.\n\n> How did you ensure the reliability and validity of the thematic analysis?\n\nWe employed several strategies to ensure the rigor of our qualitative work. Many of the questions we used in our semi-structured interviews are grounded in existing literature on challenges in responsible dataset creation [1, 2, 3]. We also conducted two pilot tests of our interview protocol before starting recruitment, allowing us to iterate and refine our instrument. \n\nTo analyze our interviews, we followed best practices from grounded theory. After establishing an initial codebook of themes, the research team (N=4) independently coded one of the interviews. We then reconvened and synchronously discussed how we coded the interviews and analyzed where we differed when applying codes. After this initial coding round, we again independently coded a second interview and repeated the same process of discussing any disagreements amongst the team before creating a finalized codebook. Only after reaching agreement on the definitions and applications of codes did we split up the remaining interviews amongst the team members. The original interview was also recoded using the updated codebook. Since this process was inductive and focused on drawing larger patterns from the interviews, using metrics such as IRR were not appropriate for measuring reliability [4].\n\nTo identify themes from the code, we had each member of the research team first generate themes, with supporting quotations, they observed in the interviews. Then, the research team met synchronously over four sessions to discuss and distill these observations into the higher-level themes discussed in the paper.\n\nFinally, to ensure thorough consideration, we drew on a diverse range of expertise by following contemporary interdisciplinary practices [5, 6, 7]. Our team consists of researchers, practitioners, and lawyers with backgrounds in HCI, ML, CV, algorithmic fairness, health sciences and policy, data visualization, and social and behavioral science. With varied ethnic, cultural, and gender backgrounds, we bring together extensive experience in dataset design, model training, and the development of ethical guidelines.\n\n[1] Holstein et al. “Improving fairness in machine learning systems: What do industry practitioners need?” CHI 2019.\n\n[2] Andrews et al. “Ethical considerations for responsible data curation.” NeurIPS D&B 2023.\n\n[3] Gebru et al. “Datasheets for Datasets.” CACM 2021. \n\n[4] Braun & Clarke.

The recognition of the paper’s contributions, especially the clear breakdown of challenges and recommendations across the dataset lifecycle and organizational levels, is appreciated. It is encouraging that the study’s broad participant base and its relevance to multiple subfields resonated well.  \n\n \n\n### Target Audience Limitations\n> The target audience of the paper is limited, many of the proposed recommendations come at the level of regulatory response, and individual dataset curators may find it infeasible to implement many of the recommendations.\n\nThe concern regarding the target audience is acknowledged. Similar to prior works [1, 2], the intention behind the recommendations is to address challenges at both the individual curator level and higher organizational or regulatory levels. This also reflects the many stakeholders involved in dataset creation. We address the reviewer’s comment in two parts: \n\n1. **Macro-scale recommendations are needed to advocate for systemic change:** Our paper emphasizes the need for systemic changes to facilitate fair dataset curation practices. Expecting individual curators to solve these problems without broader structural support would be unrealistic and could limit the effectiveness of any proposed solutions. Furthermore, recommendations, although targeting a broader audience that includes regulators and organizations, have the potential to create ripple effects that benefit individual curators. \n\n2. **Awareness around best practices is essential for curators:** We acknowledge the reviewer’s comment that curators may find implementing all recommendations infeasible. In fact, a core thread of our paper is highlighting how practitioners deal with difficult trade-offs during dataset collection. However, as pointed out in Sec. 3.2, one challenge is that practitioners are often unaware of these best practices. Thus, by taxonomizing challenges and providing clear-cut recommendations, we can help ameliorate this issue of awareness, with the understanding that practitioners may not be able to adopt every recommendation in practice. \n\n\n[1] Peng et al. “Mitigating dataset harms requires stewardship: Lessons from 1000 papers.” NeurIPS D&B 2021.\n\n[2] Jo and Gebru. “Lessons from archives: Strategies for collecting sociocultural data in machine learning.” FAccT 2020.\n\n\n### Challenges with Web-Scale Datasets:\n> Many of the documented suggestions do not address some of the fundamental issues that study participants surfaced. For example, in section 2.1 “P13 noted ML is “in this age of scale,” making them “a bit skeptical as [to] whether people are going to openly use fair datasets for training unless they’re very large.” It is unclear how many of the recommendations can fit into web-scale datasets - especially ones that are automatically generated.\n\nThe difficulty of applying fairness principles to large datasets is acknowledged. However, this perspective doesn't fully capture the broader context and intent of our paper. Our recommendations aim to build a foundation for systemic change, which is necessary for making fairness scalable in the future. Our paper acknowledges the difficulty of applying fairness principles at scale today but argues that addressing foundational issues is a critical step toward eventually achieving that goal. More concretely:\n\n1. **Scale Challenges:** Our paper documents challenges associated with scaling fairness in large datasets through the voices of participants like P13. Our paper's role is to surface these issues, providing a taxonomy of challenges, rather than offering a one-size-fits-all solution. The skepticism about the scalability of fairness is a recognized challenge, and the paper's recommendations are part of an ongoing conversation rather than an absolute solution.\n2. **Focus on Foundational Issues:** While some recommendations might not seem directly applicable to large-scale datasets, they address foundational issues that must be resolved to achieve fairness at scale. For instance, the emphasis on flexible taxonomies and diverse representation is crucial groundwork that will enable future advancements in scaling fair practices.\n3. **Recommendations as Part of a Broader Strategy:** The recommendations in our paper are designed to foster systemic changes that can gradually address fairness issues, even in large-scale datasets. While it may be difficult to apply some of these recommendations directly to web-scale datasets today, the intent is to shift the field towards practices that could make such applications more feasible in the future. For example, improved taxonomy design, enhanced traceability, and better tools for dataset curation are steps towards this goal. The recommendations should be seen as part of a broader, adaptive strategy that will evolve as technologies and methodologies develop. Our paper is a starting point, not a final answer.\n\n### Adding Figures to Main Text\n>It would be nice if the figure documenting the dataset lifecycle and more concrete recommendations were in the main text.\n\nWe appreciate the suggestion. We will move the figure to the main text to ensure it is more accessible to readers. Additionally, we will elaborate upon the concrete recommendations currently in the appendix and incorporate this directly into the main text.""}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'We appreciate the reviewer\'s positive and encouraging feedback.

Through 30 semi-structured interviews with ML dataset collectors, the study explores the definition of fairness, processes for collecting fair datasets, challenges faced, and trade-offs encountered during dataset collection. The study spans interviews conducted between November 2023 and March 2024 and is approved by the IRB ethics board of Arizona State University.\n\n### Key Contributions:\n1. **Taxonomy of Challenges**: The paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of challenges faced at different stages of the dataset lifecycle. This taxonomy is structured across phases such as scoping, design, and post-collection, providing a detailed understanding of the multifaceted issues that arise.\n2. **Broader Landscape of Fairness**: It categorizes challenges into a broader landscape, encompassing individual, organizational, and regulatory levels.

The use of semi-structured interviews provides rich qualitative data, and the thematic analysis is rigorous. The authors thoroughly summarize challenges across different phases of the dataset lifecycle—requirements, design, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance. Each challenge is well-documented with participant quotes and contextual explanations, enhancing the reliability and depth of the findings.\nHowever, more could be discussed on how potential biases in participant selection (i.e., how was gender bias addressed in the studied participants?) and interview responses were mitigated. Also, the authors should state how conflicts (inter-rater reliability) were negotiated; this could shed light on the taxonomy's trust and reliability. \n## Clarity: \nThe paper is generally well-written, with clear explanations of concepts and findings.  The use of participant quotes effectively illustrates the points made and provides a grounded understanding of the challenges discussed. The taxonomy is presented in a structured manner, making it easy for readers to follow and understand the various challenges and their implications.\nThe figures and tables effectively illustrate key points.

However, the optimal design of these linear models is still an open question. In this work, we attempt to answer this question by finding the best linear approximation to softmax attention from a theoretical perspective. We start by unifying existing linear complexity models as the linear attention form and then identify three conditions for the optimal linear attention design: (1) Dynamic memory ability; (2) Static approximation ability; (3) Least parameter approximation. We find that none of the current linear models meet all three conditions, resulting in suboptimal performance. Instead, we propose Meta Linear Attention (MetaLA) as a solution that satisfies these conditions. Our experiments on Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) task, language modeling, image classification, and Long-Range Arena (LRA) benchmark demonstrate that MetaLA is more effective than the existing linear models.","Oral Session 6D: Deep Learning Architecture, Infrastructure",https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Y8YVCOMEpz,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Y8YVCOMEpz,Y8YVCOMEpz,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'This submission receives scores of 7, 7, 8, 6, indicating an acceptance of this submission.

However, they fall short in terms of memory capacity compared to softmax attention. As we can see, there is a conflict between the increasing input sequences and the fixed memory space. Therefore, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, making it difficult to achieve Pareto optimality.

I think we should improve the softmax attention while maintaining it's non constant time and space complexity to achieve AGI that performs better than human. In this sense, I have a question about linear attention mechanisms. What if we increase memory space of linear attention mechanism as non constant (linear or log linear)? As far as I know, all linear attentions are strictly limit their space and time complexity as constant for each tokens.

In lines 633-645, we discuss that the approximation of softmax attention can be divided into two parts: value approximation and functional approximation. Our work primarily focuses on functional approximation, while the paper \'Linear Log-Normal Attention with Unbiased Concentration\' that you mentioned belongs to value approximation. \n\nThe paper \'Linear Log-Normal Attention with Unbiased Concentration\' is a commendable work, offering extensive mathematical derivations and identifying the Log-Normal method as suitable for linear models to approximate the softmax attention map from the perspectives of entropy and spectral angles. This method has demonstrated strong performance in language models, particularly on the GLUE benchmark, and highlighted the linear complexity advantage of Linear Attention in long-sequence modeling. Our paper, on the other hand, unifies the token mixing mechanisms of Linear Attention, Linear RNN, and State Space Model, linking them to the softmax attention map from the viewpoint of attention maps. We analyze under what circumstances these models can functionally approximate softmax attention.\n\nThus, both papers offer complementary insights into the theoretical analysis of the softmax attention map from different perspectives, indicating great potential for their combination.

Therefore, it is hard to know if this performance is Pareto optimal in the trade-off between latency and performance.\n\n**A:** Thanks for your suggestion, we report the latency/throughput results of 1.3 B models in the general response to all reviewers, please refer to the PDF file. The report indicates that:\n- Our model exhibits good linearity, maintaining processing speed with increasing sequence length, in contrast to the Transformer, which shows a sharp drop in token processing speed as sequence length increases.\n- Our model is computationally as efficient as linear models like Gated Linear Attention [1], while being significantly faster than the Mamba model [2], which also has linear complexity.\n\n>*Question1:* Is approximating softmax attention the optimal solution for sequential modeling? This paper aims to approximate the various characteristics of the computational and model aspects very well. However, I wonder if softmax attention is not the optimal solution for sequential modeling. Is there any justification for it? \n\n**A:** You raise a very profound and interesting question, one that we have been thinking about and we would love to discuss with you.\n\n**The AI (performance) perspective:** Although there is no strict theoretical proof of optimality for softmax attention, its excellent performance has been empirically validated by many large models, making it undoubtedly the foundation of existing large models.\n\n**The neuroscience (bio-plausibility) perspective:** It is almost certain that softmax attention is **NOT** the optimal solution for sequence modeling. To achieve AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), there are two constraints we cannot bypass.\n\n- **Power and Latency:** In terms of power and latency, the human brain operates very stable with bounded power consumption and trascient reaction. In contrast to Transformer models, if we assume the sequence input and output are interactions over time with the environment, then it faces a severe issue. Over time, its power consumption and latency will grow, a limitation brought by quadratic complexity.\n\n- **Physical Space Limitation:** As we pointed out in the paper, softmax attention is an infinite-state mechanism, leading to an increasing demand for physical space (for storage) as the model runs. This contradicts the human brain's ability to maintain a large and efficient memory capacity despite its finite size.\n\nIt can be seen that the perspective from which we view softmax attention determines whether it is optimal, and there are trade-offs involved. Our approximation strives to restore its performance optimality (which has been empirically validated), but for aspects where softmax is not optimal, we still possess unique advantages.\n\n>*Question2:* Can you provide the code?\n\n**A:** We provide the code link here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MetaLA-1BB3/README.md\n\n---\n[1] Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training, In ICML2024.\n\n[2] Mamba: Linear-time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces, In Arxiv 2023.\n\n[3]  Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models, In Arxiv 2023.\n\n[4]  You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet, In Arxiv 2024.""}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thanks for your insightful feedback and your time in reading our paper.\n>*Weakness 1:*  Concerns about the optimality for linear attention.\n\n**A:** Your concern is valid. There is no definitive evidence to prove that MetaLA is the optimal approximation of self-attention. Please allow me to explain why we chose to use this term. \n\n- First, we repeatedly state in the paper that we are discussing the necessary conditions for optimality. In fact, these necessary conditions highlight an important issue, namely, what kind of models can approximate softmax attention.\n\n- Second, we use the term ""optimal"" to draw the community\'s attention to the issue of how to approximate softmax attention. We believe that better approximating softmax attention is one of the potential ways to address cutting-edge issues in linear models, such as retrieval and in-context learning.\n\n>*Weakness 2:* The presentation in Section 2.\n\n**A:** Thank you for your suggestion. We will carefully check and optimize these expressions.\n\n>*Q1:* Explanation of the mask matrix $M$.\n\n**A:** Your understanding is correct. For the matrix $M$, the lower triangular part (including the diagonal) is set to 1 to maintain model causality, ensuring that the output at time $t$ depends only on inputs before $t$. As for the upper triangular part (excluding the diagonal),\n\n- Linear attention: The upper triangular elements are set to 0, as no exponential operation is involved.\n\n- Softmax attention: The upper triangular elements are set to $-\\infty$, ensuring that their exponentiated values become 0, thereby not affecting the normalization of values before $t$.\n\n>*Q2:* About the complexity of linear attention and the chunk-wise algorithm.\n\n**A:** As shown in Line 78, **during inference**, the time and memory complexity per token is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, meaning that computational and memory costs remain constant. From the parallel formula Eq.5 in Line74, we can express the inference in a recurrent form (operating separately on the numerator and denominator):\n\n$\nS_{t} = \\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\phi^{T}(k_{i})v_{i} = S_{t-1} + \\phi^{T}(k_{t})v_{t}, \n$\n\n$\nn_{t} = \\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\phi^{T}(k_{i}) = n_{t-1} + \\phi(k_{t}), \n$\n\n$\no_{t} = \\frac{\\phi(q_{t})S_{t}}{\\phi(q_{t})n^{T}_{t}}.\n$\n\nIn this iterative form, each operation only needs to maintain a fixed state size $S_{t}\\in\\mathcal{R}^{d \\times d}, n_{t}\\in\\mathcal{R}^d$, resulting in a storage complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ (occupying $d^{2}+d$ space, where $d$ is a constant). Furthermore, each token computation involves $d^{2}+d$ multiplications and additions, ensuring the time complexity is also $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n\n**About the chunk-wise algorithm.** The Chunk-Wise algorithm combines the low complexity of recurrent operations with the high throughput of parallel processing during training. It achieves this by using serial processing between chunks and parallel processing within chunks, ensuring (1) full utilization of GPU computational units within a chunk and (2) reduced redundant calculations of historical information between chunks.\n\nFor Linear Attention, normalization by the denominator is typically omitted. We modify the earlier formulas for further discussion (a more general form is provided in Section 4.2 of [1]):\n\n$\nS_{t} = S_{t-1} + k_{t}^{T}v_{t}, \n$\n\n$\no_{t} = q_{t}S_{t},\n$\n\nDuring training, if using a parallel form of computation, i.e., $O = (QK^{T}\\odot M)V$, these matrices must be computed from left to right, resulting in a computational complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L^{2})$. To reduce the time complexity of the linear model during training, researchers use a chunk-wise algorithm, which consists of two parts: intra-chunk and inter-chunk. We divide a sequence of length $L$ into $\\frac{L}{C}$ chunks (with padding if not divisible), each chunk of size $C$. The computation method is as follows(The first term on the right side of the equation is the inter-chunk, and the second term is the intra-chunk.):\n\n$\nO_{[i]} = Q_{[i]}S_{[i-1]} + (Q_{[i]}K_{[i]}^{T}\\odot M)V_{[i]}, \n$\n\n$\nS_{[i]} = S_{[i-1]} + K_{[i]}^{T}V_{[i]}.\n$\n\nThus, each chunk will only generate a parallel-like computation, where the resulting $C \\times C$ matrix is a submatrix of the attention map. So the computational cost is $\\frac{L}{C} [(Cd^{2}+C^{2}d)+Cd^{2}]$. If $d$ and $C$ are constants, the time complexity of the computation becomes $\\mathcal{O}(L)$.\n\n>*Q3:* Why self-attention requires infinite states.\n\n**A:** The computation for the $t$-th output of self-attention during inference is given by:\n\n$\no_{t} = \\text{softmax}(q_{t}K_{t}^{T})V_{t} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\langle q_{t}, k_{i}\\rangle v_{i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{t}\\langle q_{t},k_{j}\\rangle}\n$\n\nwhere $K_{t}^{T} = [k_{1}, \\cdots, k_{t}]$ and $V_{t}^{T} = [v_{1}, \\cdots, v_{t}]$.\n\nIn the Transformer model, a KV-Cache is maintained as a state, updated after processing each input to avoid redundant computations. Upon receiving the $ (t+1) $ -th input, the state is updated by concatenating $ k_t+1$ and $ v_t+1$ to $ K_t$ and $ V_t$, respectively, which increases memory requirements over time.\n\n>*Q4:* ""good enough"" in line 177.\n\n**A:** In the theoretical analysis, we solved for the $Q,K,\\Lambda$ matrices given any attention scores distribution. This implies a prerequisite assumption: the parameter functions $f_{q/k/\\alpha}$ can project the input $X$ into the corresponding matrix space. This prerequisite imposes constraints on $f_{q/k/\\alpha}$ (expressive enough) and $X$ (good enough).\n\n>*Q5:* The explanation of ""fewest parameters""\n\n**A:** The minimum parameters refer to the smallest parameter group that achieves optimal approximation. If the model dimension $d, d_k, d_v$ are fixed, the minimum parameters equates to the smallest group.

We find that none of the current linear models meet all three conditions, resulting in suboptimal performance. Instead, we propose Meta Linear Attention (MetaLA) as a solution that satisfies these conditions. Our experiments on Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) task, language modeling, image classification, and Long-Range Arena (LRA) benchmark demonstrate that MetaLA is more effective than the existing linear models.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'deep_learning_architectures'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/6115a7c6711108daff03a490bc177f2d26b8446b.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\nchou2024metala,\ntitle={Meta{LA}: Unified Optimal Linear Approximation to Softmax Attention Map},\nauthor={Yuhong Chou and Man Yao and Kexin Wang and Yuqi Pan and Rui-Jie Zhu and Jibin Wu and Yiran Zhong and Yu Qiao and Bo XU and Guoqi Li},\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Y8YVCOMEpz}\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'chou|metala_unified_optimal_linear_approximation_to_softmax_attention_map'}}]"

Using challenging Linguistic Olympiad puzzles, we evaluate (i) capabilities for in-context identification and generalisation of linguistic patterns in very low-resource or extinct languages, and (ii) abilities to follow complex task instructions. The LingOly benchmark covers more than 90 mostly low-resource languages, minimising issues of data contamination, and contains 1,133 problems across 6 formats and 5 levels of human difficulty. We assess performance with both direct accuracy and comparison to a no-context baseline to penalise memorisation. Scores from 11 state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate the benchmark to be challenging, and models perform poorly on the higher difficulty problems. On harder problems, even the top model only achieved 38.7% accuracy, a 24.7% improvement over the no-context baseline. Large closed models typically outperform open models, and in general, the higher resource the language, the better the scores. These results indicate, in absence of memorisation, true multi-step out-of-domain reasoning remains a challenge for current language models.",Oral Session 4A: Natural Language Processing,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06196,https://openreview.net/forum?id=cLga8GStdk,cLga8GStdk,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (Oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""This paper contributes the LINGOLY benchmark for evaluating reasoning in LLMs. The benchmark is composed of puzzles from the United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad (UKLO), which are designed to be solvable with no prior knowledge of the language(s) being tested and are often low-resource languages. Because of this, LINGOLY is from data contaminator and memorization to a high degree.\n\nAll reviewers agree this benchmark is executed exceptionally well in terms of addressing data contamination issues as well as offering a diverse set of problems for evaluating reasoning in LLMs. The paper is well executed too, with detailed description of data being clearly presented, including how the data was filtered. The experimental design is solid, covering a representative set of LLMs and interesting analysis is carried out (eg. in terms of the no-context baselines.\n\nThe main concerns are that the benchmark performance is evaluated in terms of exact string matching, and that the benchmark results are not compared to existing benchmarks (eg. in terms of a correlation analysis).

The author's responses addresses (and where not possible discusses) these raised concerns adequately, and several reviewers have increased their scores in response. \n\nAside from the above, because of the work that went into creating this benchmark and making it publicly available, and because of the general utility it provides for evaluating reasoning in LLMs, I recommend that this paper receives an oral presentation to raise further awareness.""}}, {'comment': {'value': ""Thanks for the authors' response.

Your feedback was genuinely very helpful and will improve the final version of this paper!'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thanks for these thoughts, and sorry for the last minute response. We’ve done a lot more manual digging into these points to make sure that our answers will make sense:\n\n---\n\n## **Metrics**\nWe had discussed internally using chrF and other character-based metrics, but decided against it because finding the correct answers is usually a matter of putting a word given in the examples into a different tense/plurality/etc., where only a small portion of the word needs to be changed from what is shown. (And we did find that models often copy from the context when they answer incorrectly; L229)\n\nTo check whether this made sense, we have now performed a more detailed inspection to see what difference it would make if we were to switch to chrF:\n\nAt the headline level, the ordering of the models is identical to exact matching, but obviously the scores are higher since partial credit is awarded. There is some re-ordering in the Delta_NC scores. The other findings, relationship to question difficulty and to language resourced-ness, both hold up with chrF. \n\nWe manually inspected the five responses for each model which had the highest chrF score without being exactly correct. Most examples came from missing the key idea of the problem, with examples below. About 40% of the examples did seem like good candidates for partial credit.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- A table of translations in different tenses asks to fill in missing blanks. The model provides the example which appears to one side of the blank, which is closely related but in the wrong form.\n\n- A question asks to translate literally and indicate whether the translation is grammatical, in a language where subject-verb-object ordering is determined by the “size” of the nouns. The translations are correct, but the grammaticality is not.\n\n- A question is about word order (e.g. “Yodaspeak” from Star Wars). English word order is used, which means the words are copied correctly from the prompt but the problem is not solved. This is more common in weaker models. chrF++ would help with this, but partial credit is too much here.\n\nchrF appears better than BLEU/ROUGE, but does award a lot of credit for answers which miss the key idea. In the examples, it loses some of the linguistic meaning of the problems, which we want to preserve. As such, on net we are inclined to keep exact match scores with a clear discussion of the limitations.\n\n**Action:**\nWe will replace the results for ROUGE with chrF in the Appendix, and include character-level metrics in the discussion of metrics in the main body.\n\n---\n\n## **Human Scores**\n\nYour suggestions make a lot of sense to us, but we don’t have the data we would want to create them well. Unfortunately, we only have high level aggregates, which we describe below.\n\n**What we have:**\n- For each puzzle sheet, the mean score in each level at which it was offered, typically only one level.\n- For each level and year (since 2016, excluding Round 2), the thresholds for Gold, Silver and Bronze awards in aggregate across all puzzle sheets at that level. (An exam consists of several puzzle sheets to be completed in a single time period, and medals are awarded on the aggregate.) \n\n**Problems:**\n- *Mean scores include a wide range of skills levels.* We mention age because even at the Advanced level, there are 13 year olds being averaged with 18 year olds, likely indicating a range of skill levels which we cannot directly observe. The medal thresholds are much higher than the means.\n- *Problems aren’t all worth the same number of points.* While we award one point per question, the official scoring has weights for different parts of the problems.\n- *Only the Advanced and Round 2 have standard conditions.* Because the other rounds are meant as outreach to schools, teachers are allowed to change the test conditions substantially (e.g. allowing more time, working in groups).\n- *We don’t include all puzzle sheets.* Since we exclude puzzles for reasons of permission/modality, the aggregate medal thresholds are not directly applicable. We don’t know how well the top 5% (Gold) scored on each individual puzzle sheet. Our exclusion criteria may be biased in terms of human difficulty if, for example, the authors who shared their problems with us write more challenging problems.\n\n**Best Approximation:**\nWe could report a “human standard” based on only the Advanced problems. We would construct this as a weighted average of the medal thresholds for each year, weighted by the number of problems we used from that year.\n\nUsing this approximation, the Bronze/Silver/Gold thresholds are about 44/56/69% respectively. Using the headline scores, Claude nearly reaches the Bronze, but does not, and all other models are worse. The Delta_NC scores are all less than 31%.\n\nUsing a similar method, the weighted mean score for the specific puzzle sheets we included at the Advanced level is 45%, indicating that our subset of puzzle sheets is easier than the overall UKLO corpus.\n\nOne of our authors regularly scores the UKLO, and **manually scored the model responses for the Advanced and Round 2 puzzles** from 2021-2022, where we included most of the puzzle sheets. We found that the rankings of the models was similar to exact match (a few previously close models change places, such as Gemini passing GPT-4), and the standard of performance is below the bronze threshold. This is especially true when excluding the problems which the models do well on under the no context condition, similar to the Delta_NC score.\n\nOn net, we think the approximate human medal thresholds are worth showing, since they compare reasonably well to an actual manual scoring. However, because of the many caveats, we are hesitant to include them in the main results of the paper, and will make this comparison in an Appendix.\n\n**Action:** We’ll include this approximation and analysis in the Appendices.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'confirming response'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you.

In my opinion, in case there is a huge variability across human-level performance, I would recommend either:\n1. To define baselines from different group o human performance based on certain demographic variables such as age and ability (although I am not sure if age is a relevant aspect in this case).\n2. To define baselines based on the grade distributions of the gold, silver, bronze of UKLO.

However, we do not find reason to believe that tokenization is the cause of these issues.\n\nIn the first instance, the instructions are stated in English. Both English and non-English words are provided as the objects of study, but a task such as “Translate these (Yawalapiti) words into English” does not rely on tokenizing Yawalapiti to read the instructions. (See Fig. 1)\n\nManual inspection also does not reveal any obvious issues with tokenization, but since this is difficult to spot visually we have now also conducted the following additional analysis:\n\n- For each model, we calculated the length of each prompt in tokens, and divided this by the length of the prompt in words, to produce a tokenization efficiency score per prompt. \n\n\n- For each model, we fit a regression between the answer accuracy and token efficiency on a per-language basis (i.e. one point per language). We fit regressions using both the exact match and delta NC scores, and with and without the inclusion of languages where the model scored zero.\n\nWe found that GPT-4o had the highest efficiency, averaging 1.79 words per token, and Llama 2 70B/Mixtral 8x7B had the lowest at 2.16. Gemma 7B uses a tokenizer subsetted from Gemini, which does have explicit multilingual training, though not to the degree of Aya. Gemma and Gemini both have tokenization efficiencies of 1.90. As such, differences between Gemma and Gemini are likely not caused by differences in the tokenization. These average efficiencies are all low for low-resource languages, indicative of the presence of English instructions.\n\nWe found no statistically significant (p<0.05) relationship between tokenization efficiency and accuracy for any model/metric combination except for Llama 2 70B, which did show a slightly negative relationship in ¾ cases. (This would also disappear if we applied a Bonferroni correction to the p-values).  However, lower-resource languages are more commonly used in harder difficulty questions, and all models showed worse performance on harder questions (L197, 243), so this is not conclusive evidence that tokenization was a limiting factor even just for Llama 2 70B. On the whole, with these additional experiments, we do not see reason to believe that tokenization differences are causing the patterns in performance.\n\n**Action:** We will add this analysis on tokenization to the appendix for the camera-ready version.\n\n---\n\n### **Chain of Thought**\n\nWe conducted limited experiments to examine the impact of including chain of thought. We ran the first ten sets of questions from the benchmark with GPT-4o, asking the model to “Think step by step about your answer for each part of the question.” (GPT-4o was the second best performing model, but Claude Opus costs 5x more per token.) In manual scoring of the 54 question parts, we found the following:\n\nChanged to correct answers:  4 (7%)\nChanged to incorrect answers:  2 (4%)\nChanged but still incorrect answers: 34 (65%)\nUnchanged incorrect answers: 4 (4%)\nUnchanged correct answers: 12 (22%)\n\nOverall, this quantitative picture suggests limited evidence that COT improves performance. However, we also now discuss qualitative observations of the changed answers (which also suggest COT is not assisting the model substantially).\n\nOf the newly correct answers, one was in Dutch and likely required minimal reasoning, one was a match-up where the new answers guessed the same letters repeatedly and improved the score. The other question with two improvements was in matching numbers in text to their digits, where all of the numbers were perfect cubes. Here, one improvement was pattern matching because 8^3 happened to be the answer to part 8, but came at the cost of a correct answer in the previous part because the answer to part 5 was not 5^3, but 7^3, which had been correct before. The only clear improvement was in recognizing that 1^3 should match with a single-digit word, which is still a 50/50 guess.\n\nReading the justifications of the model on the translations, there are consistently false assertions about the correspondences of words, such as assuming that word order is the same in other languages as in English and matching from there, or translating the same prefix in different ways for different responses.\n\nBased on this preliminary examination, we do not see compelling reasons to expect that using chain of thought would have a meaningful impact on the overall results. Given that this paper is establishing an initial baseline for a new benchmark, we believe that clarity and reproducibility are more important than searching for the most optimal approach.\n\n**Action:** We will add this quantitative and qualitative analysis to the appendix for camera ready. \n\n---\n\n**Seeing as we have addressed the majority of your concerns, we would ask that you consider increasing your rating to reflect any issues which we have now satisfactorily explained.** Thank you again.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'I would like to thank the authors for their response.\n\nJust to confirm for the tokenization/generation quality part: weaker and not explicitly super multilingual LLMs such as Gemma 7B (presented in Table 1) does not face great tokenization/text generation/instruction following issue on low-resource languages such as Yawalapiti (line 151)? The author response only discussed GPT-4, GPT-4o, Command R+ as to this point, while I would like to know whether the weaker models evaluated in the paper could adequately generate text and/or follow instructions on the lowest resource languages.\n\nAgain on CoT: this is a ""reasoning puzzles"" benchmark, as indicated by the title. I understand that CoT is ""expensive"", but does it really make sense that LLMs are ""reasoning"" without CoT/any intermediate steps and are only allowed to answer in very few words? I understand that other researchers could certainly run the eval with CoT, but without CoT the experiment/evaluation part of this submission is potentially weakened.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thank you very much for your feedback! Your comments are clearly thoughtful, and we’ll explain our thinking in each case.\n\n---\n### **Memorisation and Contamination**\n\nWe make a distinction between memorisation and contamination, where a language model may be able to perform an unseen reasoning task because it has seen a sufficiently similar task in the past even though the task itself was not leaked. For example, one of the easiest tasks involves matching numbers 1-10 in different European languages to their respective language, which is probably memorized but not leaked. There is evidence that this happens with other tasks (McCoy et al. 2023), and it is hard to know exactly which tasks (e.g. “Draw a zebra using TikZ”). We use the ΔNC metric to check whether this is happening. We do also take precautions around contamination, such as using canary strings in the dataset and anywhere we use actual examples from the tasks and encrypting the GitHub files to prevent scraping.\n\n\n**Action:** With the additional space in the camera ready version of the paper, we will add a more nuanced discussion of this point to the Discussion section or expand our existing discussion in the Introduction.\n\n---\n\n### **Delta NC metric**\n\nWe agree that one way to increase the score would be to lower the S(rNC). However, using the same example, if a model which didn’t already know that “uno, dos, tres” means “1, 2, 3” in Spanish could match “uno” to Spanish from context alone, that would be more convincing evidence of reasoning than if GPT-4o could do so. This is not actually a stance on the usefulness of having exposure to many different languages, but a stance on the quality of evidence that can be given for reasoning when a model does have previous exposure. **Essentially, we are not awarding credit for answers which seem likely to be memorized.** If the headline scores were close to 100%, this could be problematic, but at present we have plenty of room.\n\n---\n\n### **Tokenization and Reading Generated Text**\n\nThe tokenization point is an interesting one and not what we expected to find. We expected to see significant performance improvements between GPT-4 and GPT-4o for this reason, but do not, leading us to believe that better tokenizers are not the most important factor here, though they may play some role. **We did read through the model responses in order to produce Section 5.1 (see L222)**, where we discuss common error types which appear across models. Command R+ did appear to have tokenization issues in a few cases which led to degeneracy, but the other models listed did not. As noted in that section (see L229), one of the most common error types was to reproduce words from the context which were not the correct answer, again suggesting that the tokenizations were not the bottleneck here.\n\n**Based on your recommendation, we have now run the Aya 23 35B model on the benchmark as well.** We found that the performance was similar to that of Llama 3 8B in level and in which questions were answered correctly (see attachment). This is consistent with the existing results, and suggests that multilingual tokenizers do not confer a meaningful advantage in performance on this benchmark.\n\n**Action:** We will add Aya 23 35B to the analyses in the paper. We will also add an additional discussion of explicitly multilingual models and tokenizers (Aya 23, GPT-4o).\n\n---\n\n### **COT**\nIt is certainly possible that chain of thought prompting would improve scores on this benchmark. However, chain of thought is considerably more expensive and would have prevented us from running as many different models as we did. We have made the benchmark simple for others to run, which enables other prompting approaches to be tested by others in the future.\n\n**Action:** We have nearly finished integrating the benchmark with the Eleuther Harness (https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), which should make it even easier to pick up and use. We will expand the discussion to our limitations about COT, and recommend it as a low-hanging fruit for future research.\n\n---\n### **Killer examples in main paper**\n\nSection 5.1 (line 222) provides a qualitative examination of the types of errors which appear beyond the raw metrics. Given space limitations we put the full text examples in the appendices.\n\n**Action:** We will add a killer example to the main paper for camera-ready demonstrating errors. \n\n---\nThank you again for your detailed and thoughtful feedback.  **We hope we have addressed your concerns and you might consider increasing the score in line with our responses, additional results from Aya, and the other reviewers’ comments.**'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/12b24737ddc8184b21f23b4bce370306932d2e7a.pdf'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thank you very much for your feedback!

We appreciate your strong rating and confidence in the quality of our results.\n\nWe definitely understand your concern about the generalisability of linguistic problem solving as a task. As you note, we chose linguistic problems for partly practical reasons regarding contamination, but we do think that skills being tested would transfer to a wide range of contexts. The main reason for this is the nature of the problems themselves, which are more about reasoning than linguistics in most cases. As an example, problems tend to ask things like “Given these example translated words, how would you create the plural form of this word X?” While this is a question about linguistics, solving it involves noticing patterns in the provided information and generalizing them to new information. We therefore think that although language problems are a narrower area, the abilities being tested are broadly applicable. Since “reasoning” is such a difficult concept to measure on its own, our approach is similar to other papers which try to assess reasoning through proxy tasks which are not themselves very useful (e.g. Chollet 2019).\n\n**Action:** We will clarify this specific discussion point, for example by providing an example puzzle in the main body so that readers can see what is being assessed. We will also add this discussion of generalisability and naturalistic tasks to our limitations.\n\nThank you again for your positive review, and for the time spent reading this paper.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Well-written paper and interesting dataset'}, 'summary_and_contributions': {'value': 'The authors contribute a linguistic reasoning dataset in low-resource and extinct languages, drawn from the UK linguistics olympiad.

To me the low-resource and linguistic knowledge angle is already very good, while this work does not take explicit steps to mitigate data contamination in benchmark construction. Maybe the authors will say the ""no-context baseline"" represents the memorization-free aspect, which brings to the next point.\n\n- For the no-context baseline and specifically $\\Delta_{NC}$, the authors claim that ""A higher $\\Delta_{NC}$ indicates a greater ability to use the 179 information provided in the question context to generate the correct answers."" (lines 178-179) For $\\Delta_{NC}$ to be higher, $S(r_{NC})$ needs to be lower, but isn\'t it a good thing that LLMs have good priors about low-resource languages, such that they could reason correctly even without context? I feel like the boundary of what is bad ""memorization"" and ""contamination"" versus what is good ""memorization"" and ""knowledge"" of low-resource languages is a bit blurry here.\n\n- For some of the LLMs, are they really multilingual enough for evaluation on ""low-resource and extinct languages""? For example, gemma, llama2/3, mistral were not explicitly designed to be super multilingual, and according to my own experience the tokenization and generation is quite poor on low-resource languages such as Telugu. I wonder if 1) the authors have read the generated text to see if they are able to function in low-resource/extinct languages, 2) if it\'s meaningful to include not-so-multilingual LLMs in the evaluation, 3) maybe include explicitly multilingual LLMs such as Aya.\n\n- CoT was not employed in evaluation (line 188): by that you mean there is only a ""Answer:"" prompt at the end and the LLM chooses an option/answers the question in like 10 tokens? I\'m not sure if this is adequate for this reasoning-intensive benchmark though.\n\n- In addition to benchmarking on LingOly, maybe some analysis could be included in the main paper that goes beyond just overall performance numbers.

However, the evaluation process presents substantial challenges. A primary obstacle is the benchmarking of agent performance across diverse scenarios within a unified framework, especially in maintaining partially-observable environments and ensuring multi-round interactions. Moreover, current evaluation frameworks mostly focus on the final success rate, revealing few insights during the process and failing to provide a deep understanding of the model abilities. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentBoard, a pioneering comprehensive benchmark and accompanied open-source evaluation framework tailored to analytical evaluation of LLM agents. AgentBoard offers a fine-grained progress rate metric that captures incremental advancements as well as a comprehensive evaluation toolkit that features easy assessment of agents for multi-faceted analysis through interactive visualization.

(for the toolquery example)**\n\nA4: \n> 1) **“frequently fixating upon the exact matching”** \n\nWhen constructing APIs for tool-query, we ensure that the functionality and outcome of one action cannot be replicated by combining other actions. This design choice results in a deterministic set of essential actions, which are processed as subgoals. Each subgoal corresponds to the result of an API call.\n\nFor APIs other than `finish`, the outputs are derived from querying the underlying database. Given the expected input arguments, the output format and content are fixed, allowing for exact matching without issues. However, for the `finish` API, the output is generated by the LLM through summarizing previous interactions. This can potentially affect exact matching. To address this, we incorporated constraints into the instructions. For example, in a test case like: *“On the 19th or the 25th, I want to choose a day to go hiking. Which day has less rainfall? Please provide the answer in the YYYY-MM-DD format”*, we specify the “YYYY-MM-DD” format to reduce variability.\n\nIn practice, we have not observed any exact matching errors in calculating progress rates.\n\n>2) **“even if the final output is achieved with some extra API calls, the success rate for the query is measured to be zero”**\n\nWe clarify that all subgoals represent necessary intermediate states that must be reached in a fixed order. For example, the agent must first check the movie ID and then the cast to find the director. The task is considered complete once both the movie ID and cast information are obtained, and an answer is correctly given. However, the agent is allowed to take detours or make additional API calls between subgoals. As a result, the success rate will be accurately measured, even if the final output is accompanied by extra API calls.\n\n>3) **“The subgoal evaluation seems to be too strict, restricting the models capability of having any prior information of the query”**\n\nWe aimed for a strict subgoal evaluation because we want the model to complete tasks based solely on agent interactions, rather than relying on prior knowledge. While the model might choose to use its prior knowledge to answer questions, we address how we restrict this in the next reply.\n\n> 4) **“The prompting technique also does not provide specific details on strictly deciphering from the agent interactions only. ”** \n\nYou are right that we did not strictly restrict the models to generate responses *only* based on interaction results, yet we do instruct them to use the provided tools to find answers. We also include relevant in-context examples to guide them. Below is the prompt we use:\n\n```\n{\n""system_msg"": ""You should use actions to help people solve problems.\\n""\n  ""instruction"": \n""We detail name, description, input(parameters) and output(returns) of each action as follows:\nName: get_search_movie(movie_name)\nDescription: Search for a movie by name and return basic details\nParameters:\n\t- movie_name (Type: string): The name of the movie to search for.\nReturns:\n\t- id : The ID of the found movie.\n\t- overview : The overview description of the movie.\n\t- title : The title of the movie.\n… \nName: finish(answer)\nDescription: Return an answer and finish the task\nParameters:\n\t- answer (Type: [\'string\', \'number\', \'array\']): The answer to be returned\nIf you are finished, you will call \\""finish\\"" action\nPlease refer to the format of examples below to solve the requested goal. Your response must be in the format of \\""Action: [your action] with Action Input: [your action input]\\""""\n}\n\n[example here] …\n\n```\nDespite the current lenient prompt restrictions, empirically we find that models primarily access information via tools to deliver accurate answers. Besides, our test examples pertain to relatively recent knowledge obtained through tool queries, and in most cases the benchmarked models do not have internal knowledge to address the queries. When curating these examples, we ensure they cannot be directly answered using GPT-4 alone. For instance, in the movie task, we ask about the 2023 Oscar winner *""Everything Everywhere All at Once""*, which falls beyond the knowledge cut-off date for most popular models.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thanks for your valuable suggestions! We address the concerns below.\n\n> **Q1: The number of test cases is too small in some scenarios, \u200b\u200bleading to potentially drastic variations in evaluation results**\n\nA1: This is a valid point. The number of test cases for some subtasks is limited partially due to expensive annotation on these environments, and we agree with the reviewer that the score variance may be high on the single task with a very small number of test cases. Despite this limitation, we highlight that on the higher-level category separation, each category (e.g. Game or Tool) has over 100 test cases, and thus the average scores within each category, or the overall average scores for the entire AgentBoard, can be used to reflect agent performance much more stably. In the next revision, we plan to report the average scores within each category (which can be easily computed with the current per-task scores and the number of test cases of each task) as well for a more stable comparison to be potentially referenced by future researchers. In the meanwhile, we do plan to add more test examples to the tasks with a small number of test cases in future maintenance of AgentBoard. \n\n\n> **Q2: The action space is too limited**\n\nA2: Our type of actions/APIs is relatively limited, with only 8-15 action types. However, generating the correct and logical action remains challenging. The agent must determine not only the type of action but also the appropriate argument from the parameter set. For instance, the action ""put {obj a} on {obj b}"" can result in many combinations based on the available objects. In tasks like ScienceWorld, there are about 100 valid actions to choose from for each step. Although the action space is small, it is complex. The best-performing GPT-4 model achieves only 86% grounding accuracy, while the top open-source model, Llama3-70B, has just 66%. This shows that it is already challenging for models to use these APIs correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n> **Q3: The paper could better address the rules and intuitions behind the design.**\n\nA3: Thanks for the advice! During the annotation stage, a human player uses an interactive annotation panel to first engage with the task until finishing. The panel records all states and actions and the player should select essential states that must be passed through and record them as subgoals. A subsequent verification process ensures quality of these annotations as introduced in Appendix I. We will provide more details and clarify these designs further in the next revision for more consistent and replicable test case creation.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thanks for the valuable suggestions!

We agree that incorporating the open-world game MC will be well-suited for our benchmark to evaluate LLMs in more complex environments. We’ll definitely consider adding it in future maintenance\n\n> **Q2: Whether training a specialized model to generate subgoals instead of relying on manual annotation is an available approach?**\n\nA2: This is a good idea and it could help extend the benchmark more easily. We think that generating subgoals automatically may be feasible and some previous studies [1][2] have used LLMs like GPT-4 to label subgoals, which can effectively guide LLMs as value functions. We resorted to human annotations to ensure correctness of these subgoals to be used during benchmarking, and we will explore automatic generation of these subgoals as future work when we further expand AgentBoard.\n\n\n[1] Zhang, Shenao, et al.

""Reason for future, act for now: A principled framework for autonomous llm agents with provable sample efficiency."" ICML 2023.\n\n\n> **Q3: The most important limitation, as the authors also mentioned in the paper, is the need for manual annotation of subgoals.**\n\nA3: We use human annotations to ensure the correctness of subgoals during benchmarking, prioritizing reliability over scalability. We agree that human annotation is time-consuming and limits extensibility of the benchmark, thus we plan to explore automatic subgoal generation as described in A2 above when we further expand AgentBoard in the future. \n\n> **Q4: Does imposing restrictions on tools and locations to achieve a unique path limit the capabilities of LLMs? For instance, without considering subgoals, would removing the restrictions on locations and tools potentially increase the success rate of LLMs?**\n\nA4: Imposing restrictions on tools and locations will not lower the performance of LLMs, as the main requirement is for the LLM to comprehend the instructions. We tried to ensure that the designated tool is not more difficult to use than another tool. For example, using a pot on a stove to heat is not more challenging and does not require more steps than using a microwave.  In contrast, we observe slight improvement of success rate after giving the model restriction instructions, as the restriction can act as a hint to the model; for instance, after giving the model restriction instructions *“You should get apple juice and boil it in the kitchen. The objects you can use are a metal pot, a thermometer, a fridge, cups, and a stove in the kitchen. ”*, it can learn from instructions to use the stove to heat an object.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': 'Thanks for the positive review! We address the concerns below.\n> **Q1: The paper is not very clear about the definition of grounding, for which there is no universal definition / benchmark yet**\n\nA1:  Definition of grounding indeed varies in different works. In this work, we adopt the definition from [1][2], which describes grounding as the process of mapping high-level plans to **executable** actions, no matter whether the plan is correct or wrong. This requires the LLM\'s ability to format outputs according to instructions, which is crucial for both tool usage and robotic tasks. While grounding accuracy is improving as LLMs become adept at generating API calls and formatting outputs, success in grounding does not necessarily indicate that agents excel at planning, as executable actions do not imply the high-level plans are correct. Even if all actions are executable, a problem may remain unsolved due to logical or decision-making errors.\n\n[1] Gu, Yu, Xiang Deng, and Yu Su.

We agree that multimodal agent evaluations are important for LLM agents. Our submission focuses on evaluating agentic ability of text LLMs, and we will explore multimodal versions in future works. \n\n> **Q3: code skills help with agent tasks - which makes sense for tasks involving coding and functional calls, but there is less evidence on improvement of general planning capabilities due to slightly better results in game environment**  \n\nA3: We conclude that code skills help with agent tasks due to the substantial average improvement when comparing Lemur-70b & CodeLlama-34b to Llama2-70b, and comparing CodeLlama-13b to Llama2-13b. The code models outperform their chat counterparts across most tasks. We agree with the reviewer that substantial improvements are not uniformly observed across all tasks, thus we plan to revise this claim to make it more accurate in the next revision of the paper. \n\n > **Q4: it might be clearer to sort results based on model size / parameter numbers for comparisons**  \n\nA4: Thanks for the suggestion! We will provide clearer comparison of different model sizes.\n\n> **Q5:   it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between subgoals and simply steps to accomplish the tasks. Are there any particular guidelines on how sub-goals are created?**\n\nA5: The main difference between subgoals and steps is that subgoals serve as necessary checkpoints for the task. We ensure that the agent must accomplish these subgoals to complete the task, although it may take various steps, including detours, to reach them.  \n \nWe annotate subgoals using an interactive panel that requires the human player to play through the task first. The panel records the history of actions and states, as well as tell whether the player has finished the task. The player then selects the essential states from the history that must be passed through and records them as subgoals. Then a rigorous human verification process is performed described in Appendix I to ensure quality of these subgoals.'}}, {'rebuttal': {'value': ""We thank the reviewer for the positive comments!

In general, we compute the progress rate metrics using Equation 2 of the submission, where the specific $r_t^{\\text {subgoal}}$ and $r_t^{\\text {match}}$ for each environment are detailed in Appendix K. The final, binary success rate is 1 only when progress rate is equal to 1. We briefly summarize the metric computations in the table below, and we will present it more clearly in the next revision of the paper.  \n\n| Tasks | Progress Rate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Success Rate        |\n|-|-|-|\n| ALF   | We provide subgoal annotations.

Yet, forecasting beyond the weather timescale is challenging because it deals with problems other than initial condition, including boundary interaction, butterfly effect, and our inherent lack of physical understanding. At present, existing benchmarks tend to have shorter forecasting range of up-to 15 days, do not include a wide range of operational baselines, and lack physics-based constraints for explainability. Thus, we propose ChaosBench, a challenging benchmark to extend the predictability range of data-driven weather emulators to S2S timescale. First, ChaosBench is comprised of variables beyond the typical surface-atmospheric ERA5 to also include ocean, ice, and land reanalysis products that span over 45 years to allow for full Earth system emulation that respects boundary conditions. We also propose physics-based, in addition to deterministic and probabilistic metrics, to ensure a physically-consistent ensemble that accounts for butterfly effect. Furthermore, we evaluate on a diverse set of physics-based forecasts from four national weather agencies as baselines to our data-driven counterpart such as ViT/ClimaX, PanguWeather, GraphCast, and FourCastNetV2. Overall, we find methods originally developed for weather-scale applications fail on S2S task: their performance simply collapse to an unskilled climatology. Nonetheless, we outline and demonstrate several strategies that can extend the predictability range of existing weather emulators, including the use of ensembles, robust control of error propagation, and the use of physics-informed models.

For future work, we are actively finding ways to increase the temporal resolution by e.g., stitching different products and harmonizing them for consistency, applying advanced downscaling methods, etc (each, however, comes with different pros and cons and can be a good avenue for future research).
