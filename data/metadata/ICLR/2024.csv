"['HAOYUE DAI', 'Ignavier Ng', 'Gongxu Luo', 'Peter Spirtes', 'Petar Stojanov', 'Kun Zhang']",ICLR,Gene Regulatory Network Inference in the Presence of Dropouts_ a Causal View,https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19739,2024," Gene regulatory network inference (GRNI) is a challenging problem, particularly owing to the presence of zeros in single-cell RNA sequencing data: some are biological zeros representing no gene expression, while some others are technical zeros arising from the sequencing procedure (aka dropouts), which may bias GRNI by distorting the joint distribution of the measured gene expressions. Existing approaches typically handle dropout error via imputation, which may introduce spurious relations as the true joint distribution is generally unidentifiable. To tackle this issue, we introduce a causal graphical model to characterize the dropout mechanism, namely, Causal Dropout Model. We provide a simple yet effective theoretical result: interestingly, the conditional independence (CI) relations in the data with dropouts, after deleting the samples with zero values (regardless if technical or not) for the conditioned variables, are asymptotically identical to the CI relations in the original data without dropouts. This particular test-wise deletion procedure, in which we perform CI tests on the samples without zeros for the conditioned variables, can be seamlessly integrated with existing structure learning approaches including constraint-based and greedy score-based methods, thus giving rise to a principled framework for GRNI in the presence of dropouts. We further show that the causal dropout model can be validated from data, and many existing statistical models to handle dropouts fit into our model as specific parametric instances. Empirical evaluation on synthetic, curated, and real-world experimental transcriptomic data comprehensively demonstrate the efficacy of our method.",Oral 1D,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gFR4QwK53h,https://openreview.net/forum?id=gFR4QwK53h,gFR4QwK53h,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'The authors analyze a causal model that allows them to handle (basically by ignoring them) the positivity violations in the data, specifically for gene regulatory networks.

Please kindly note that upon double check, we believe the current one is indeed correct: the term in Bernoulli(Â·), e.g., logistic$(\\log 2 - Z_i)$, is the probability of dropout ($D_i = 1$), which is why the density function of $Z_i$ is multiplied not by this term, but by one minus it, i.e., logistic$(-(\\log 2 - Z_i))$.

Please see below for our response.\n\n---\n\n**(Q1)** The reviewer requests clarification on the claim that ""(for the correctness of GES), only local consistency of the scoring function is actually needed"".\n\n**R:** Thank you for your feedback on this point. We have revised this part in the [updated submission](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gFR4QwK53h) to make the logical connection clearer. Here is a summary: first, the fact that only local consistency is required for GES\'s consistency can already be seen from Chickering (2002)\'s proof. Specifically, their Lemma 9 and Theorem 4 (main results) are grounded on local edge modifications. Then, we mention Nandy et al. (2018) as they make this point more explicit: they derive the BIC score change directly as the partial correlation involved in local consistency definition (Lemma 5.1), and further go beyond BIC score, suggesting ""defining generalized scoring criterions by... conditional independence"". This is recognized and implemented by [4] at the same time, and later by [5], [6].\n\n---\n\n**(Q2)** The reviewer wonders for some technical details regarding the identifiability result without assumption A3 (i.e., when dropout can be affected by other genes). Specifically,\n\n> ""What is the \'identifiability upper bound\' for identifying the dropout mechanisms?""\n\n**R:** The identifiability upper bound of dropout mechanisms is characterized by Proposition 2 in Appendix C.1: ""If $Z_i$ and $Z_j$ are truly adjacent in GRN, then whether they affect each other\'s dropout, i.e., whether edges $Z_i \\rightarrow R_j$ and $Z_j \\rightarrow R_i$ exist, is naturally unidentifiable"". This is because in this case, the (in)dependence between e.g., $Z_j$ and $R_i$ given at least $Z_i$, is untestable (see Proposition 3, Testability of CI queries).\n\nThen, what if $Z_i$ and $Z_j$ are truly non-adjacent in GRN? Theorem 2 indicates that this non-adjacency, together with the absence of $Z_i \\rightarrow R_j$ and $Z_j \\rightarrow R_i$, can be identified barring one particular case. So,\n\n> ""What is this \'one particular case\'""?\n\n**R:** This particular case is when the non-adjacent $Z_i$ and $Z_j$ **always share a common child** (not descendant -- so we say it as so *particular*) that has to be conditioned on. This is formally defined in Proof of Theorem 2: ""For every $\\mathbf{S} \\subset \\mathbf{Z}$ that d-separates $Z_i$ from $Z_j$, there is an open path $Z_i\\rightarrow W \\leftarrow Z_j$, where either $W \\in \\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{S}\\cup \\{i,j\\}}$, or there exists a $k \\in \\mathbf{S}\\cup \\{i,j\\}$ s.t. $W$ is $R_k$\'s ancestor"". Only in this particular case, the true d-separation cannot be recovered, resulting in a false adjacency.\n\nWe thank you for your detailed interest in these aspects of our work. For further clarity, we hope you will find Appendix C, particularly the illustrative examples (Figures 8 and 9), helpful.\n\n---\n\n**(Q3)** The reviewer wonders why test-wise deletion performs better than the oracle in Figure 4(b).\n\n**R:**  As is discussed in Appendix D.1, regarding why test-wise deletion method outperforms the oracle in the lognormal setting, one possible explanation is that, after zero deletion, many small values (especially for truncated and logistic dropout mechanisms) are removed; therefore, the resulting distribution is closer to Gaussian. Given that our experiments use Fisher\'s Z tests for conditional independence -- merely for speed consideration, as discussed in our Q3 response to reviewer pofH -- this closer alignment with Gaussian distribution may inadvertently enhance the CI test accuracies.\n\n---\n\n**(Q4)** The reviewer suggests explicitly mentioning the causal sufficiency assumption, given its significance in the context of constraint-based methods.\n\n**R:** We appreciate your emphasis on this. Indeed, causal sufficiency was implicitly included here in our assumption A1, as one of the ""common assumptions needed for the asymptotic consistency of constraint-based methods"". We have made it explicit in the [updated submission](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gFR4QwK53h). Furthermore, we completely agree that it is an important future research problem -- note that the proposed zero deletion for CI correction is general and can be seamlessly incorporated into any existing constraint-based methods, and it would be interesting to see how this idea can be incorporated into existing local causal discovery methods, or methods that allow hidden confounders.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer pofH'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We sincerely appreciate the reviewer\'s encouragement and insightful feedback. Please see below for our response.\n\n---\n**(Q1)** The reviewer wonders whether non-zero values could also be ""technical"", i.e., subject to sequencing errors.\n\n**R:** Thank you for this insightful point. As discussed in Appendix B.1, it is indeed possible that non-zero values are also influenced by technical errors, and that should be addressed separately from the general measurement error issue [1]. In this paper, we focus only on the dropout errors, mainly for the following two reasons:\n\n - Unlike general measurement errors that are ubiquitous in empirical sciences with a long history of research, dropout errors are **peculiar to scRNA-seq data** (in contrast to bulk RNA-seq data), owing to specific technical challenges like low RNA capture efficiency (Section 1). Our study thus focuses on this more specific and recent issue in the field.\n - Empirically, dropout errors in scRNA-seq data tend to be **more harmful** to downstream tasks than measurement errors [2]. Non-zero values, despite potential technical errors, are usually centered around the true expression levels, with errors manifested as relatively minor random noise. It is less likely for a true zero to be falsely reverse-transcribed into a non-zero cDNA count (out of no mRNA molecules). However, a true non-zero can be dropped out to zero, and this happens excessively, leading to a substantial distortion of the true gene expressions. This distortion is a more pressing concern, and thus forms the crux of this research focus.\n\n---\n**(Q2)** The reviewer wonders whether the method relies on the fact that non-zero values of conditioned variables can be found, even with an elevated dropout rate of, say 50%.\n\n**R:** Yes, our method relies on it, as exactly outlined in assumption A5, which states that a sufficient sample size of conditioned variables remains after zero deletion. A5 is justified in the following aspects:\n\n - A5 is commonly satisfied in real scRNA-seq data, thanks to the inherent sparsity of GRNs. As a gene usually only interacts with a relatively small number of other genes, we usually don\'t need to condition on a large number of variables, resulting in larger remaining sample sizes. This is empirically supported by our **real data experiments (Figure 3)**.\n - A5 is also validated by a synthetic experiment with varying dropout rates (Figure 12 in Appendix D.1): even when the dropout rate is **as high as 70%**, the remaining sample sizes for CI tests are still considerably high to avoid large Type-II errors, leading to consistently better SHDs and skeleton F1-scores.\n - Additionally, it\'s worth highlighting the advantages of scRNA-seq technologies which can nowadays easily produce hundreds of thousands of samples within a single run. This innovation renders concerns over sample size somewhat mitigated.\n\n---\n**(Q3)** The reviewer suggests using kernel-based CI tests for log-normal data, instead of the Fisher\'s Z tests currently used.\n\n**R:** We appreciate your suggestion. Our use of Fisher\'s Z tests (and BIC scores) was merely for speed consideration in experimental runs. Although there is empirical evidence suggesting the approximate suitability of Pearson partial correlations in Gaussian copula models [3], and our results indeed improve a lot over baselines (that\'s why we didn\'t further include the result by more accurate but slower conditional independence testing methods, such as KCI-test), we can\'t agree more that kernel-based tests, theoretically, would be more appropriate here -- not only for log-normal setting but also for Gaussian setting (both (a) and (b) in Figure 4), as after the dropout distortion, the joint Gaussianity among $\\mathbf{Z}$ is also not preserved in $\\mathbf{X}$ anymore, even with zero deletions.\n\n\n---\n**(Q4)** The reviewer recommends improving the clarity of presentations, such as in Figure 5 and in code documentation.\n\n**R:** Thanks for raising this suggestion. In response, we have revised the explanation for Figure 5 in our [updated submission](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gFR4QwK53h) for better clarity.

We have indeed incorporated these metrics in the experiments of our experiments. Please see below for details:\n\n - In **Figure 11 of Appendix D.1**, we show the precisions and recalls in skeleton edges identification, and the results strongly validate our method's efficiency: Test-wise deletion performs best with consistently highest precisions.

The SOTA algorithms output edges with strengths so the best F1-scores through thresholding are reported, while since PC and GES do not output strengths, only the results from a fixed significance level are reported.

"['Ching Fang', 'Kimberly Stachenfeld']",ICLR,Predictive auxiliary objectives in deep RL mimic learning in the brain,https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19748,2024," The ability to predict upcoming events has been hypothesized to comprise a key aspect of natural and machine cognition. This is supported by trends in deep reinforcement learning (RL), where self-supervised auxiliary objectives such as prediction are widely used to support representation learning and improve task performance. Here, we study the effects predictive auxiliary objectives have on representation learning across different modules of an RL system and how these mimic representational changes observed in the brain. We find that predictive objectives improve and stabilize learning particularly in resource-limited architectures, and we identify settings where longer predictive horizons better support representational transfer. Furthermore, we find that representational changes in this RL system bear a striking resemblance to changes in neural activity observed in the brain across various experiments. Specifically, we draw a connection between the auxiliary predictive model of the RL system and hippocampus, an area thought to learn a predictive model to support memory-guided behavior. We also connect the encoder network and the value learning network of the RL system to visual cortex and striatum in the brain, respectively. This work demonstrates how representation learning in deep RL systems can provide an interpretable framework for modeling multi-region interactions in the brain.

Striatum will indirectly project back to sensory cortex via thalamus. Also it may be possible that hippocampus projects back to sensory visual cortex. Hippocampal activity early in a trial can be predictive of information in visual cortex at a later time in the trial (see Hindy et al. 2016 Nature Neuroscience). Regardless of the biological realism of these recurrent connections, I think there could be useful normative principles in having recurrent loops between modules in this architecture.\n\nWe agree this is an important direction to investigate, and we have added experiments to the manuscript that speak to it. To begin testing this, we added recurrency in the model and tested the model on a partially observable version of the alternating-T maze task in Figure 4. These new results are added to Appendix Figure 5. In this version, the model is only provided with a 2D visual observation that indicates its current location ($o_t$). The model is modified with recurrency such that its previous latent state ($z_{t-1}$) is fed back into the encoder. Thus, $z_t = E(o_t, z_{t-1})$. To solve the task, the model must use recurrency to maintain an internal memory of its current context. We find that the predictive auxiliary objective greatly improves the modelâs ability to learn this partially observable task (Figure A5DE). The splitting across population representations are still similar as in the fully observable case (compare Figure A5F with Figure 4I). These experiments show how recurrency can be used to solve more complex tasks. We also found from these experiments that learning can still be stable even in a model with both recurrency and self-predictive objectives. Finally, the representations that resulted from these experiments show how recurrency strongly biases representations to be more âsplitâ/decorrelated across conditions. \n\nHowever, we still have not explored the effects of recurrency across modules. As the reviewer points out, there is plenty of experimental and anatomical evidence to suggest that recurrency plays a strong effect across brain areas. For simplicity and ease of interpretability, we started with a feedforward network. There is certainly a lot of room to improve on this aspect of the model. We mention this as a useful direction in the discussion paragraph discussing limitations of our work.\n\n> Fig 5c: The change in firing rates seem pretty small between before/after exposure. Are these changes statistically significant?\n\nTo address this comment, we ran a t-test across samples of firing rate changes before/after exposure (i.e. the values displayed in Figure 5D). We find that the change in firing rate of both models (the model with a predictive objective, and the model without a predictive objective) are significantly different than 0:\n\n| Model | sequence location | p-value | t-statistic |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| With Prediction | 1 | $0.002$ | $-3.69$ |\n| With Prediction | 2 | $3.2 \\times 10^{-7}$ | $-9.04$ |\n| With Prediction | 3 | $7.4 \\times 10^{-5}$ | $-5.5$ |\n| Without Prediction | 1 | $0.0009$ | $-4.17$ |\n| Without Prediction | 2 | $0.002$ | $-3.74$ |\n| Without Prediction | 3 | $0.009$ | $-3$ |\n\nIn addition, we also run a two-sample t-test to check how different the means of both models are from each other:\n\n| Sequence location | p-value | t-statistic |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 1 | $0.48$ | $0.71$ |\n| 2 | $0.03$ | $2.32$ |\n| 3 | $0.03$ | $2.24$ |\n\nThus, we conclude that the model with predictive objective does change the firing rates to flip the preference of neurons before/after exposure. In particular, the effect of this flip is strongest at the images close to the swap location (e.g., sequence locations 3 and 2), consistent with the observations in the Li & DiCarlo papers.

It seems important to describe what this is to put Fig. 4's results in context.\n\nWe have modified the description to clarify this:\nâThat is, the input into the encoder at time $t$ is $o_t + \\alpha o_{t-1} + \\alpha^2 o_{t-2}+\\dots$ for some $\\alpha<1$. This decaying sum of recent observations captures information about the recent past in a simple way, and is inspired by representations hypothesized by temporal context model (Howard & Kahana, 2002). â\n\n> Last, I don't think there was any section in the paper explicitly discussing the limitations of the work. I think this is an important part of any iclr paper so it'd be good to include one.\n\nThank you for this suggestion â we agree it is a good practice. We add the following sentence to the conclusion:\nâOur results are limited in the complexity of tasks and the diversity of auxiliary objectives tested. Future work can improve on current understanding by more systematically comparing effects across objectives over more complex tasks. We also did not examine representations developed in the value learning network, which is ripe for comparison with striatum data.â\n\n**Questions:**\n\n> Why use an off-policy learner (Q-learning) rather than on-policy? An on-policy learner would seem to be more biologically realistic. Also I think an actor-critic approach (e.g. A2C, PPO, etc) may reflect what striatum is doing more than Q-learning?\n\nThis is a really great question! It would be interesting to explore how different value learning networks affect the robustness of the results and the representations found in the system. We unfortunately did not have time to test these different simulations. There were a few factors that motivated our initial  design choice to use a Q-learning system:\n1. There is some precedent in that previous papers model the striatum with Q-learning and discuss experiments that indicate the striatum may be explained by both actor-critic and Q-learning setups (Geerts & Burgess 2020, Averbeck & OâDoherty 2022, Blackwell & Doya 2023, ). For our purposes, using a deep Q network was a simple approximation for a general model-free reinforcement learner. Interestingly, a recent theoretical paper has suggested the presence of action-surprise signals in striatal dopamine combined with an actor-critic architecture results in a model that approximates Q-learning (Lindsey & Litwin-Kumar 2022).\n2. Freely behaving animals have been observed to learn in an offline manner. For instance, Rosenberg & Meister 2021 show that freely behaving mice in a maze will behave largely randomly in initial environment explorations. These mice will then make directed and efficient trajectories to rewards when not exploring.\n3. Finally, the offline learning setting is relevant because it connects to the hippocampus in many ways. Hippocampal replay has been suggested to contribute to offline RL as the supplier of the replay buffer used in the RL updates (Mattar & Daw 2018). The negative sampling we used in the predictive model (which relies on random replay) is also supported by hypotheses of pattern separation in the hippocampus. Thus, there are interesting biological similarities between the use of an offline replay buffer and activity in the hippocampus. In future experiments, we are interested in using this structure to test replay-related hypotheses.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer T1AU (Part 1)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Thank you very much for your considered, thoughtful, and very actionable review.

We have updated the related works section with the reviewerâs suggestions, as well as additional references that help contextualize the work.\n\nâA growing body of work considers modular and multi-objective approaches to building integrative models of brain function. One approach has been to construct multi-region models by combining modules performing independent computations and comparing representations in these models to neural activity (Frank & Claus, 2006; OâReilly & Frank, 2006; Geerts et al., 2020; Russo et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023, Jensen et al. 2023). On the behavioral end, there has also been prior work discussing how the addition of biologically-realistic regularizers or auxiliary objectives can result in performance more consistent with humans (Kumar et al., 2022; Binz & Schulz, 2022; Jensen et al., 2023). Our work differs in that the entire system consists of a neural network that is trained end-to-end, allowing us the opportunity to specifically study the effects on representation learning. In this paper, we show how deep RL networks can be a testbed for studying representational changes and serve as a multi-region model for neuroscience.â\n\n> On page 4, the description of the auxiliary losses can be improved. Itâs an important part of the work so it'd be good to have this be as clear as possible. A sentence describing what exactly \\tau is representing and why L_+ is a loss term that enforces transition structure in the state representations would be very helpful.\n\nThank you for the suggestion! Weâve added the following clarification in section 3 where we describe the role of $L_+$:\n\nâThe positive sample loss is defined as $L_+ = ||\\tau(z_t, a_t) - z_{t+1} - \\gamma \\tau(z_{t+1}, a_{t+1})||^2$, where $z_{t} = E(o_{t})$ and $\\tau(z_{t}, a_{t}) = z_{t} + T(z_{t}, a_{t})$. That is, in the $\\gamma=0$ case, the network $T$ is learning the difference between current and future latent states such that $\\tau(z_t, a_t)=z_t + T(z_t,a_t) \\approx z_{t+1}$. This encourages the learned representations $z$ to be structured so as to be consistent with predictable transitions (Francois-Lavet et al, 2019).â\n\n> Also, for the third term in L_+, shouldn't it be $\\tau(z_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$ and not $\\tau(o_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$?\n\nYes, thanks for the catch! It is now fixed.\n\n> For the negative sampling loss term, making it explicit z_i and z_j  are latent representations of states that are not consecutive in the same area where the loss term is introduced would be helpful.\n\nThanks for the suggestion! Weâve added the following in the beginning of paragraph 3 of section 3:\nâWe emphasize that $z_i$ and $z_j$ are randomly sampled from the buffer and thus may represent states that are spatially far from another.â\n\n> It'd also be good to have a sentence explaining the motivation for choosing these two specific auxiliary losses. I suspect it's loosely inspired by pattern completion vs pattern separation in hippocampus (respectively) but it would be good to confirm that in this section.\n\nThanks for the suggestion! That is part of the motivation. We have expanded the explanation in section 3 to the following:\n\nâThis loss drives temporally distant observations to be represented differently, thereby preventing the trivial solution from being learned (mapping all latent states to a single point). The use of two contrasting terms ($L_-$ and $L_+$) is not just useful for optimization reasons -- it also mirrors the hypothesized pattern separation and pattern completion within the hippocampus (OâReilly & McClelland, 1994; Schapiro et al., 2017). However, we note that negative sampling elements are not always needed to support self-predictive learning if certain conditions are satisfied (Tang et al 2023).â""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer CL1C'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Thank you very much for your thoughtful and positive review!

We were not just interested in the predictive network but also wanted to explore how the other modules in the system mutually interacted. We make a few edits to the introduction to emphasize that we are interested in the roles of both learning heads.\n\nIn paragraph 2 of the introduction we add:\nâIt is unclear how value learning, predictive objectives, and feature learning mutually interact to shape representations.â\n\nIn the final paragraph of the introduction we make a few modifications:\nâWe further demonstrate that a deep RL model with multiple objectives undergo a variety of representational phenomena also observed in neural populations in the brain. Downstream objectives can alter activity in the encoder, which is mirrored in various results that show how visual cortical activity is altered by both predictive and value learning. Additionally, learning in the prediction module drives activity patterns consistent with activity measured in hippocampus.â\n\n\n**Questions**\n> I'm curious to learn if there is a similarity between the action selection network and the neural activity observed in the striatum\n\nThis is a great question! There is prior work that has explored the similarities between action selection networks in deep RL models and striatal neural activity. For instance, Dabney & Botivinick 2020 show how signals in the ventral tegmental area, a main projector to the striatum, can be explained by value encoding in the distributional RL framework. Lowet & Uchida, in an upcoming 2023 NeurIPs UniReps workshop paper, further this line of work by recording from striatum and demonstrating consistency with a distributional RL model as well. As another example, Lindsey & Litwin-Kumar 2022 show how action-modulated striatal dopamine responses can be explained by value encoding in a deep actor-critic model that is approximating deep Q-learning.\n\nHowever, there is still much to explore in comparing the value network with striatal experiments. In particular, there are likely interesting effects resulting from the other modules of the system, and our model would be a great testbed for these effects. Although we did not have the time to explore this, we added a sentence in the discussion paragraph discussing limitations of our work: âWe also did not examine representations in the value learning network, which is ripe for comparison with striatum data.â\n\n\n> Figure 2: Were cells that didn't show place-like activities filtered out in these analyses?\n\nAll cells were included in population level analyses, without any exclusion criteria. However, to display example place fields for Figure 4B, cells are sorted by spatial modulation and the top four cells are shown for each cell. All additional cells are pictured in the Appendix, however.\n\n\n> Were there also place-like activities in the encoder model?\n\nThis is a great question! We do find place-like activity in the encoder model. We think there are two interesting points of discussion around this finding:\n\n1. Place-like activity has been found in various sensory areas (Fiser & Keller 2016, Town & Bizley 2017, Long & Zhong 2021). Thus, perhaps the fact that our encoder network shows place-like activity provides a possible explanation for this finding in the experimental literature. That is, the combination of spatially correlated inputs and downstream predictive learning can induce spatial structure into upstream areas.\n\n2. On the other hand, it should be noted that we optimized our network for one task, and optimized all networks end-to-end. It's unclear if such place-like representations would arise under a more realistic setup. For instance, the encoder network could be asked to learn  representations for many tasks, some of which are not spatial. This may result in encoder representations more agnostic to space. As another example, the learning rate of the encoder network could be slower than that of the downstream hippocampus-like network (Tang et al). This could result in the spatial structure being mostly stored in the hippocampus-like network and not being propagated to upstream regions like the encoder.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer f2kS (Part 2)'}, 'comment': {'value': '> If possible, please consider varying the complexity of the environments... What is the effect of varying the complexity of the environment?\n\nWe agree that varying the complexity of the environment would be a helpful way to test the robustness of the observed effects.\n\nTo further test the effects of environment complexity, we ran a new set of experiments in which the observation at each state in the gridworld environment consisted of a different CIFAR image, and included these results in Appendix Figure 2-3. We find the results to be consistent with the simpler gridworld inputs we use in the main figures (Figure A3C). That is, predictive auxiliary objectives enable faster learning of the gridworld task compared to other models (Figure A3C). Additionally, the model equipped with a predictive objective can learn the task for small latent sizes whereas the model without auxiliary objectives cannot (Figure A3C). We update section 4.1 to discuss these results.\n\nWe also note that prior work has tested predictive auxiliary objectives in single-task settings with greater task complexity. In these findings, the inclusion of these objectives consistently improves performance over models without auxiliary objectives (Jaderberg et al., 2016; Shelhamer et al., 2016; Shelhamer et al., 2016; Oord et al., 2018; Wayne et al., 2018). \n\n> Do you have thoughts about how partial observability might affect the predictive module? \n\nWe predict that a predictive auxiliary objective may provide additional benefits in a partially observable task. For instance, the additional predictive information induced by the transition module can help the network infer hidden state dynamics better. In cases of observation noise, predictive information can also help network representations ignore irrelevant or noisy parts of the observation. \n\nTo further test this, we ran new experiments with a partially observable version of the alternating-T maze task in Figure 4H. These new results are added to Appendix Figure 5. In this version, the model is only provided with a 2D visual observation that indicates its current location ($o_t$). The model is modified with recurrency such that its previous latent state ($z_{t-1}$) is fed back into the encoder and can be used to infer the current latent state. Thus, $z_t = E(o_t, z_{t-1})$. To solve the task, the model must use recurrency to maintain an internal memory of its current context. We find that the predictive auxiliary objective greatly improves the modelâs ability to learn this partially observable task (Figure A5D).

Four discrete actions are possible (up, down left, right) and the 2D  visual inputs to the agent are either (A) a top-down view of the agentâs location in the arena or (B) the same top-down view with pixels randomly shuffled. In recently introduced experiments (described below) we also experiment with (C) CIFAR images as visual input for added visual complexity.

Please provide examples of these environments. \n\nYes, this is an important point. The predictive auxiliary objective assumes that the effects of actions in the environment are predictable. Specifically, the predictive network is trained to predict $z_{t+1}-z_{t}$ given $(z_t, a_t)$.\n\nTo further test the effects of environment predictability, we ran additional experiments in a stochastic gridworld environment and included these results in Appendix Figure 3. In this environment, transitions are not deterministic. There is a probability $p$ that the agentâs action $a$ is not obeyed and instead the environment transitions according to an unselected action instead.

Jensen et al. 2023 bioRxiv introduce a predictive auxiliary loss which helps the agent learn when to plan and reproduces replay patterns seen in rodent hippocampal work. \n3. This is not exactly auxiliary predictive loss, but I think it is having the same effect, Binz & Schulz 2022 NeurIPS show adding a regularization term to the loss on the number of bits required to compress the agent's weights reproduces quirks in human exploration.\n\nI think the clarity in some portions in this submission can be improved. \n\n1. On page 4, the description of the auxiliary losses can be improved. Its an important part of the work so it'd be good to have this be as clear as possible. A sentence describing what exactly $\\tau$ is representing and why  $\\mathcal{L_{+}}$ is a loss term that enforces transition structure in the state representations would be very helpful. Also, for the third term in $\\mathcal{L_{+}}$, shouldn't it be $\\tau (z_{t+1},a_{t+1})$ and not $\\tau (o_{t+1},a_{t+1})$? For the negative sampling loss term, making it explicit $z_{i}$ and $z_{j}$ are latent representations of states that are not consecutive in the same area where the loss term is introduced would be helpful. It'd also be good to have a sentence explaining the motivation for choosing these two specific auxiliary losses. I suspect its loosely inspired by pattern completion vs pattern seperation in hippocampus (respectively) but it would be good to confirm that in this section. \n\n2. It would be helpful to state what the colors in Figure 2D mean. It wasn't clear to me upon first read. \n\n3. The memory component in page 8 is not explained at all. It seems important to describe what this is to put Fig. 4's results in context. \n\nThere are a couple of design decisions that left me a little confused (details in the questions section). It would be nice for the authors to clarify the motivations behind them.\n\nLast, I don't think there was any section in the paper explicitly discussing the limitations of the work. I think this is an important part of any iclr paper so it'd be good to include one. \n\nReferences:\n1. Kumar, S., Correa, C. G., Dasgupta, I., Marjieh, R., Hu, M.

Why use an off-policy learner (Q-learning) rather than on-policy? An on-policy learner would seem to be more biologically realistic. Also I think an actor-critic approach (e.g. A2C, PPO, etc) may reflect what striatum is doing more than Q-learning? \n\n2. Is there a reason why there is no recurrence in the model? Striatum will indirectly project back to sensory cortex via thalamus. Also it may be possible that hippocampus projects back to sensory visual cortex. Hippocampal activity early in a trial can be predictive of information in visual cortex at a later time in the trial (see Hindy et al. 2016 Nature Neuroscience). Regardless of the biological realism of these recurrent connections, I think there could be useful normative principles in having recurrent loops between modules in this architecture. \n\n3.

For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2. In addition, we further conduct supervised fine-tuning with LongLoRA and our long instruction-following LongAlpaca dataset.

In these benchmarks, there are comprehensive generative tasks, including document QA, summarization, few-shot learning, code completion synthetic tasks, and other open-ended tasks in L-Eval. Our model presents comparable or even better performance than other counterparts, with about 4 hours for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs.

The original Table 4 (Table 3 in the revision) is not designed to show perplexity improvements, which we never claim. The goal of LongLoRA is to significantly improve the training efficiency (in terms of both memory consumption and training speed) without compromising the perplexity achieved through finetuning the full model. We have clarified this point in the caption of Table 3 In the revision. \n\n[1] Yushi Bai, Xin Lv, Jiajie Zhang, Hongchang Lyu, Jiankai Tang, Zhidian Huang, Zhengxiao Du, Xiao Liu, Aohan Zeng, Lei Hou, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Juanzi Li: LongBench: A Bilingual, Multitask Benchmark for Long Context Understanding.

In the following, we provide responses to the concerns.\n\n**Q1: âComparisons to methods that train long-context from scratch.â**\n\nA: Thanks for this question. We agree with you that training long-context from scratch could be an interesting direction. Nevertheless, training long-context LLMs from scratch is too computationally expensive and unaffordable for most researchers. LongLoRA provides an efficiency advantage of orders of magnitude compared to training long-context LLMs from scratch. For instance, Llama-2 models require training with 2 trillion tokens across hundreds of GPUs, whereas LongLoRA models are finetuned on about 2 billion tokens for 32k context length using just 8 A100 GPUs.\n\nRecently, Meta published a concurrent research paper, LLama2-Long [1]. In this paper, the authors empirically verified that long-context continual training on short-context models is more efficient and similarly effective compared to pretraining from scratch with long sequences. This conclusion could further magnify the importance of LongLoRA.\n\n**Q2: âRegular LoRA and LongLoRA use the same amount of memory in Table 11. $S^2$-Attn for memory, or only ï¬ops?â**\n\nA: The reason why $S^2$-Attn does not reduce the memory usage on top of LoRA (LoRA+) in the original Table 11 is that we adopt FlashAttention-2 [2] for the implementation of self-attention layers. This library fuses all operators in multi-head self-attention (MHSA) into a single CUDA kernel and thereby avoids writing the attention score matrix to DRAM. So the memory space required for MHSA is around $2 * B * N * C$, where B is the batch size, N is the sequence length and C is the number of channels. The multiplier 2 corresponds to input and output activations. \n\nNevertheless, if FlashAttention-2 is not used, the vanilla dense attention requires $2 * B * N * C + B * N^2 * C$ memory space. Here, $B * N^2 * C$ corresponds to attention scores. In comparison, our $S^2$-Attn requires only $2 * B * N * C + 4 * B * (N/4)^2 * C = 2 * B * N * C + 1/4 * B * N^2 * C$ memory space. Empirically, we include an additional comparison that disables the FlashAttention-2 in the table below. Under a context length of 8192, $S^2$-Attn improves the training speed by 2.1x and memory usage by 1.8x. With a 16k context length, the original dense attention runs out of memory during training while $S^2$-Attn is still feasible. We have included this comparison in the Table 13 of the revision.\n\n| $S^2$-Attn | Train hours (8192) | Memory - GB (8192) | Train hours (16384) | Memory - GB (16384) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| x | 17.5 | 55.5 | OOM | OOM |\n| â | 8.2 | 30.3 | 20.8 | 57.1 |\n\n[1] Wenhan Xiong, Jingyu Liu, Igor Molybog, Hejia Zhang, Prajjwal Bhargava, Rui Hou, Louis Martin, Rashi Rungta, Karthik Abinav Sankararaman, Barlas Oguz, Madian Khabsa, Han Fang, Yashar Mehdad, Sharan Narang, Kshitiz Malik, Angela Fan, Shruti Bhosale, Sergey Edunov, Mike Lewis, Sinong Wang, Hao Ma: Effective Long-Context Scaling of Foundation Models.

To avoid repetition, we have relocated the original Table 2 to Table 6 (in Section 4.2) and shortened relevant descriptions in Section 3.2. In Section 3.2, the objective is to show that we can âtrain sparse, test denseâ with $S^2$-Attn.

We have removed the word âsomehowâ in the section you mentioned. Retrieval-based evaluation shows that LongLoRA extends the context window of a pre-trained LLM. Specifically, Llama-2-7b sharply fails to retrieve the passkey when the context window exceeds 4k, while our method maintains a high retrieval accuracy (60-90%) even at a much longer context length of 33k-45k. \n\n**Q7: âThe original standard self-attention at inference time.â**\n\nA: In Table 6 of the revision (the original Table 2), for each attention pattern, we evaluate its performance under two protocols. In the first row, we use sparse attention in both training and testing. In the second row, we use sparse attention only for training and the standard full attention for testing. For our $S^2$-Attn, it achieves the best perplexity with the original full self-attention at inference time.

For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine.

It decomposes natural language instructions into actionable sub-instructions and summarizes HTML pages to interact with web pages programmatically.

It successfully applies ensemble techniques to use different models collaboratively for task completion, enhancing scalability and allowing for efficient error analysis. The focus on real-world application, as evidenced by its success in real-world web navigation tasks, underscores the practical relevance of this research. Additionally, the use of executable Python code for web interactions makes the agent adaptable to a wide range of actions on real HTML pages, moving beyond the limitations of predefined action spaces.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nA significant weakness is the paper's reliance on Flan-U-PaLM, a 540B parameter model, which raises questions about the method's dependency on such large-scale models.

We also summarize our revision below.\n\nFor the **pre-training** dataset, we collect 100 WARC files (April 2019) from the CommonCrawl corpus and remove the non-Unicode or alphanumeric-only HTML documents. We then extract subtrees around <label> elements that have a special attribute called âforâ that associates the corresponding label with a unique input element in the same HTML document. This pre-processing step improves the quality of the pre-training corpus by focusing only on HTML that is relevant for instruction following and grounding. Our final dataset has 3.41M examples.\n\nFor the **finetuning** dataset, we sample instructions by randomly assigning values to placeholders in manually-curated templates. We employ a rule-based parser to decompose instructions into sequences of sub-instructions;  corresponding reference IDs are retrieved from HTML using regular expressions. At each step of the process, Flan-U-PaLM is provided with the sub-instruction and the associated HTML snippets to generate navigation programs that are executed through Selenium WebDriver. HTML-T5 is fine-tuned using self-experience demonstrations gathered through instruction sampling, scripted planning, and prompted program synthesis, as detailed earlier. It utilizes task instructions (e.g. please search 2 bedroom and 2+ bathroom houses in new york, ny with a max price of $7500 on real estate website), sub-instruction histories (e.g. go to real estate website,type in new york into search,click on search, click on price, click on max rent), and raw HTML as inputs. Subsequently, it generates the next sub-instruction (e.g. type in 7500 into max rent) and extracts the relevant `data-ref` attributes used for retrieving HTML snippets.\n\n\n\n\n**> Questions 7**\n\nThe agent navigates to the same home page but the underlying HTML document could be different. For example, home pages can show example listings that change between visits to the website.\n\n\n\n\n**> Questions 8**\n\nHTML-T5 is first pre-trained with the new HTML corpus that we curated from CommonCrawl (Section 3.1). Subsequently, it is finetuned on the entirety of MiniWoB's available demonstrations.\nFigure 4 compares the success rates on MiniWoB among finetuned methods based on different pre-trained models (LongT5, Flan-LongT5, HTML-T5, and Flan-T5). All the models in Table 4 are exclusively **finetuned** with 12K/347K MiniWoB demonstrations, rather than with multi-task corpora including other NLP tasks. We compare the efficacy of pre-trained models for simulated web automation tasks.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author Response to Reviewer Jsxu (1/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We appreciate your careful reading and detailed discussion of our paper. We address your concerns below and please let us know if there are remaining questions or unclear points.\n\n\n**> Questions 1**\n\nPre-defined action spaces are a-priori defined sets of all effective actions that an agent can perform. Our goal is to show that programs offer superior alternatives to pre-defined action spaces: They are more flexible (open-ended), and adaptable, allowing them to benefit from advancements in program synthesis. By âcanonical sub-instructionsâ, we refer to the rule-based parsing of instructions to sub-instructions. We revised the caption of Figure 1, deleted the âcanonicalâ word from the abstract to reduce ambiguity, and revised Section 3 to clarify.\n\n**> Questions 2**\n\nYes, few-shot prompting. We used generic examples, including selecting checkboxes, entering text into inputs, clicking on options, and scrolling, for few-shot prompting. These examples are independent of any domain in our study to ensure simplicity, robust generalization to unseen websites, and prevent any information leakage. We also clarified few-shot prompting in Section 3.3.\n\n\n**> Questions 3**\n\nInput is common across all tasks, encompassing user instructions, navigation history, and raw HTML documents. However, outputs vary depending on the specific task. In real-world website navigation (Section 4.1), outputs consist of paired sub-instructions and corresponding `data-ref` attributes associated with the relevant elements. Within MiniWoB, outputs are defined as pre-defined actions (e.g., ""click(ref=X)"") as outlined by the simulator. In Mind2Web, outputs manifest as multiple-choice questions (e.g., âBâ) and operational labels (e.g., âClick XXXâ). Section 4.1 focuses on interactive real-world evaluation, while Section 4.2 explores evaluation on the simulator and offline evaluation. We revised section 4.2 to clarify.\n\n\n\n\n**> Questions 4**\n\n*Planning* is predicting the next sub-instruction to be executed based on the current state. Rather than predicting all the sub-instructions in advance, HTML-T5 iteratively generates the next sub-instruction per step (i.e. closed-loop planning). *Summarization* is retrieving all the relevant HTML snippets by predicting their `data-ref` attributes, similar to extractive summarization. The combined sub-instruction and HTML snippets serve as the input for Flan-U-PaLM. We revised Section 3 to clarify.\n\n\n\n\n**> Questions 5**\n\nWe added the following paragraph to the beginning of Section 3 to explain the high-level workflow of WebAgent:\n\nâUsers initiate natural language interactions with a clear intent, such as apartment searching. Upon receiving the initial request, HTML-T5 formulates a âgo to<URL>â sub-instruction, triggering Flan-U-PaLM to generate a corresponding Python program that navigates to the specified website.The raw HTML content of the newly opened page is extracted and fed into HTML-T5 along with the userâs instruction and previous planning steps. This information is utilized to predict the next sub-instruction and identify relevant reference IDs for extractive HTML summarization. Flan-U-PaLM,in turn, generates a Python program based on these sub-instructions and the combined HTML snippet.This iterative process of planning, summarization, and program synthesis continues until a designated end-of-episode sub-instruction is predicted or the maximum number of iterations is reached.â'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author Response to Reviewer eCh6'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful review and comments.

Furthermore, we provided a detailed explanation of HTML-T5 fine-tuning, which employs demonstrations collected through scripted planning and prompted programming to train HTML-T5 for automated planning and summarization tasks.\n\nWe collect 260 episodes on real-estate, 230 episodes on social-media, and 410 episodes on map websites (explained in `Evaluation Methodology` in Section 4.1). Examples for different tasks are illustrated in **Appendix D**. Please let us know if you have further unclear points.\n\n\n**> Weaknesses 3 & Questions 2**\n\nWe revised Section 3.2 to clarify fine-tuning of HTML-T5 and prompting of Flan-U-PaLM. HTML-T5 is fine-tuned to predict sub-instructions and corresponding `data-ref` attributes directly from raw HTML documents. HTML snippets that correspond to these âdata-refâ attributes are extracted and merged, similar to how extractive summarization [2] or retrieval works. We feed merged HTML snippets to prompt Flan-U-PaLM to generate navigation programs as depicted in Figure 3. Please let us know if you have further unclear points.\n\n\n**> Weaknesses 4 & Questions 3**\n\nOur preliminary analysis has shown that approximately 90% of our pre-training HTML corpus has around 4K context length (see Figure 5). While raw HTML documents can be longer, our pre-processing methodology extracts useful subtrees for pre-training; substantially reducing context length (see Appendix C) while improving effectiveness (see Table 7 for an ablation). That is why we **pre-train** HTML-T5 using 4096 window size (`Pre-Training with Mixture of Long-Span Denoising` in Section 3.1), but finetune it with 16K window size (Section 4.2) to generalize to real-world HTML documents. \n\n\n\n\n**> Weaknesses 5 & Questions 4**\n\nIn the context of real-world navigation, we constructed a single dataset of instructions. This dataset was carefully partitioned into training and testing sets to guarantee no overlap. All instructions included in the testing set are provided in Appendix F. For both MiniWoB and Mind2Web, we adopted the experimental setup established by their respective authors. In MiniWoB, instructions are randomly generated from a vast pool of instructions, and environments accept an argument for either ""training"" or ""testing.""

However, we emphasize that our primary focus is on comparing models that are readily accessible, disclose their training corpus, and adhere to the same training dataset size (12K or 347K).

We address your concerns below. Please let us know if you have further questions.\n\n\n**> Weaknesses 1**\n\nFollowing ICLR 2024 Author Guide (https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide), we added the ethics statement section between the main text and reference. We discussed that a careful treatment of the subject from the researchers, policymakers and industries to form guidelines and regulations to prevent misuse of web automation from negatively impacting real users is needed. Please check page 10 in the revised paper.\n\n\n\n\n**> Weaknesses 2**\n\nWe have added new results to Appendix K (Figure 9) that compare Flan-U-PaLM-540B, publicly available gpt-3.5-turbo, and smaller model-size variants of the Flan-PaLM family of models (8B and 62B sized models). These models were tested on the map website using the same set of instructions. The results demonstrate that:\n\n\n- Flan-U-PaLM-540B and gpt-3.5-turbo exhibit comparable performance (80% success, 93.8% score).\n- Flan-PaLM-62B (60% success, 86.3% score) falls short of Flan-U-PaLM-540B due to inferior program synthesis capabilities.\n- Flan-PaLM-8B was unable to generate valid programs.\n\n\nOur findings indicate that increasing model size enhances WebAgent performance, and that any LLM capable of generating python/selenium code can be integrated into WebAgent.\n\n\n\n\n**> Questions 1**\n\nOur planner, HTML-T5, is trained to automatically replan whenever a new state is observed. By doing so, the agent will react more quickly when an unusual transition is encountered. For example, in case an error causes the state to go to the home screen before finishing apartment search, the agent will immediately start replanning from the first step.\n\n\n\n\n**> Questions 2**\n\nOur results show that the performance of WebAgent would improve with scale. Model-size ablation of HTML-T5 shows that if we increase the number of parameters from 220M to 3B, the performance gets better (Table 8 in Appendix H). In Table 4, we also show that increasing the data size from 12K to 347K improves the performance. We also briefly explain these points in Section 5 (`Broad Generalization across the Internet`). \n\n\n**> Questions 3**\n\nWe have explained the details of HTML-T5, including its architecture, training process, and data preprocessing steps. HTML-T5 utilizes publicly available T5 models and is trained on the CommonCrawl corpus.

In addition it is pre-trained on various long-range denoising objectives.\n- To be able to execute actions on real websites, WebAgent produces executable Python code instead of discrete and non-generalizable HTML actions.

Are there any other agents that could be used on this benchmark? \n\n---\n\nAnother weakness of this work is its clarity and ease of comprehension. Some aspects of the paper were not entirely clear, in particular how was HTML-T5 trained to predict sub-instruction plans and HTML summaries? What data supervision was used for that?\n\nSimilarly, it is not entirely clear what HTML-T5 produces: Figure-3 indicates ""HTML-snippets"", but the paper mentions multiple times that it ""summarizes"" HTML pages (so it should produce a summary?), and in Section 3.2 the paper states that it predicts ``_the corresponding data-ref attributes_\'\'. If the model outputs only data reference IDs (like suggested also with Figure 6) then this is not summarization but more like information retrieval and the paper should reflect this. In addition, if object references are what is really being predicted, then it is not clear how Flan-U-PaLM make use of that information without having access to the raw HTML containing these objects.\n\nAnother confusion is the window size of HTML-T5: in Section 3.1 it is mentioned that the input sequence length of HTML-T5 is 4096, but in section 4.2 it uses 16k tokens for the context window. Which one is it? 16k tokens seems more likely overall since the model is supposed to take as input instruction, previous sub-instructions, and raw HTML. Just the raw HTML would overflow the 4096 context size as mentioned in the paper and illustrated by Figure 2. After reading 4096 in Sections 3.1, it was hard to understand how all inputs of HTML-T5 would fit in such a small window (especially after seeing Figure 2).\n\n---\n\nEventually, one important thing that the paper should discuss is the difference between train and test settings.

Discuss any potential ethical issues.**\n\n\nThanks for pointing this out. We will include an additional potential ethical section in the Appendix: \n1) **Unemployment and Skill Obsolescence**: MetaGPT enables more people to program in natural languages, thereby making it easier for engineers to get started. Over the years, programming languages have evolved from punched cards to assembly, C, Java, Python, and now natural language. As a result, humans have become more proficient at programming, increasing the demand for programming-related positions. Furthermore, programming with natural language may offer a significantly easier learning curve, making programming more accessible to a broader audience.\n2) **Transparency and Accountability**: MetaGPT is an open-source framework that facilitates interactive communication between multiple agents through natural language. Humans can initiate, observe, and stop running with the highest level of control. It provides real-time interpretation and operation of the natural language, displayed on the screen and logs, ensuring transparency. MetaGPT enhances ""natural language programming"" capabilities, and human engineers are the users and responsible for the outcomes.\n3) **Privacy and Data Security**: MetaGPT operates locally, ensuring user data privacy and security. It does not collect user data. For interactions with third-party LLMs, such as those by OpenAI, users are encouraged to refer to the respective privacy policies (e.g., OpenAI Privacy Policy). However, we provide the option of open-source LLMs as backends.\n\n---\n\n**We appreciate your time in reading our feedback and look forward to further discussion and your suggestions.**'}}, {'title': {'value': ""Thanks for your review! Authors' feedback [2/3].""}, 'comment': {'value': '**Q5 (Original Q2). Statements: ""MetaGPT stands out as a special solution that allows efficient meta-programming through a well-organized and specialized group of agents"". How does the author define these professional concepts? For example, ""efficient"" and ""well-organized"". **(1)** I haven\'t seen any evidence or convincing analysis of why it can be ""efficient"", nor have I seen experimental validation. **(2)** How do you define ""specialized group""?**\n\n**(1) Existing experiments validate our claims.** In Table 1, we show ""efficiency"" with lower Running Times (762 vs. 541 seconds) than ChatDev, using identical instructions for software generation. We also report higher Productivity (token usage/total code lines), with our figures at 248.9 vs. 124.3, using half as many tokens per code line.\n\n|Model|Running Times (/seconds)|Productivity (token usage/total code lines)|\n|---|---|---|\n|ChatDev|$762$|$248.9$|\n|MetaGPT|$541$|$124.3$|\n\n**(2)** In our context, a **\'specialized group\'** refers to a group of agents where each agent is assigned specific roles with unique tools and skills. This ensures efficient task execution and collaboration. **For instance, the ProductManager can summarize instructions and write product requirement documents (as in Figure 1), whereas the Engineer focuses on code execution and debugging with coding tools.** In MetaGPT, different roles can also output specialized files in PDF, PNG, and Python formats, and users can directly view them.\n\n---\n\n**Q6 (Original Q4). Is it trivial to maintain consistency in MetaGPT? What are the professional definitions of ""unproductive cycle"" and ""beneficial""? Are there experimental results to validate these advantages?**\n\n* 1) **Consistency:** Maintaining consistency is not trivial and presents a challenge in many applications, as highlighted in work [1,2,3]. MetaGPT addresses this by breaking down tasks into granular sub-tasks, enabling each agent to gain a deeper understanding of their specific responsibilities. This approach is crucial, particularly in function design and coding requirements for downstream agents (e.g., Engineer), to prevent misunderstandings or error propagation during collaboration using LLMs.  \n* 2) **Unproductive cycles:** In work [2], it\'s noted that two cooperating agents often face challenges like the \'Assistant Repeats Instruction\' problem or the \'Infinite Loop of Messages\'. These issues emerge from repetitive, context-less conversations leading to unproductive exchanges, such as repeatedly saying ""Goodbye"". Reference [4] discusses an issue where agents become stuck in a loop while addressing complex or ambiguous tasks, chaining thoughts in a behavior-like pattern. We can improve the quality of code generation by reducing unproductive cycles through SOPs, as described in Table 1.  \n* 3) **Beneficial interactions:** Previous work [5] highlights the requirements engineering in software development, particularly abstraction and decomposition, significantly improving code generation. Constraints also improve LLMs\' understanding of fuzzy, abstract, and multitasking semantics [6]. Thus, we introduced a structural communication protocol to assist agents in task decomposition and semantic understanding, aiming to minimize ambiguities and errors, fostering beneficial interactions.\n\nWhen reproduced to other frameworks, we found that these issues occur frequently. The SOPs and communication mechanisms in MetaGPT can alleviate these issues, thus achieving better performances (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 4).\n\n[1] Elazar Y, Kassner N, Ravfogel S, et al.

In Section 4.2, what is ""the cost of human revision"" and how can it be rigorously measured?**\n\n**Human revision** refers to times of manual code corrections, which tackle problems like package import errors, incorrect class names, or incomplete reference paths. Typically, each correction involves up to 3 lines of code. To minimize subjectivity, we enlisted three individuals (paid at a rate equivalent to a minimum of 15 USD per hour) to document their debugging process.\n\n---'}}, {'title': {'value': ""Thanks for your review!

We\'ll address your concerns in our following response.\n\n---\n\n**Q1 (original W1). Methodological innovation: How does MetaGPT differ from other methods?**\n\n> 1) **Agents in SOPs**: MetaGPT pioneers the introduction of SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures), a departure from works like CAMEL [2], which don\'t discuss task-specific labor division. Unlike generative agents [1] that simulate open-world human behavior freely, MetaGPT focuses more on applying valuable human practice and better organizing multiple agents.  \n> 2) **Structured communication v.s. Chat-based communication**: Sec 3.2 highlights how MetaGPT, unlike other chat-based communication models such as ChatDev [3], Self-collaboration [4], and CAMEL [2], introduces structured communication. MetaGPT limits the range of message content, focusing agents on relevant information and avoiding meaningless conversational chat. Consequently, this approach reduces token usage and enhances task success rates.\n\n[1] Park, Joon Sung, et al. ""Generative agents: Interactive simulacra of human behavior.""

Deep-seated challenges.**\n\nMetaGPT also alleviates or solves these challenges with its unique designs:  \n1) **Use Context Efficiently**: Two sub-challenges are present. First, unfolding short natural language descriptions accurately to eliminate ambiguity. Second, maintaining information validity in lengthy contexts, enables LLMs to concentrate on relevant data without distraction.\n2) **Reduce Hallucinations**:  Using LLMs to generate entire software programs faces code hallucination problemsâ-including incomplete implementation of functions, missing dependencies, and potential undiscovered bugs, which may be more serious than hallucinations in natural language generation. Deep-seated challenges in task decomposition and translating from natural language to code language persist. LLMs often struggle with software generation due to vague task definitions. Focusing on granular tasks like requirement analysis and package selection offers guided thinking, which LLMs lack in broad task solving.\n\n---\n\n**Q3 (Original W2, Q5, Q6). The comparison methods used to assess the effectiveness of MetaGPT do not appear to be fully equivalent to what MetaGPT offers. **(1)** ""We compare recent domain-specific LLMs in the code generation field ...""; **(2)** ""We modified certain role-based prompts in order to instruct the MetaGPT framework to generate individual functions instead of entire classes. Is it fair to compare with these frameworks? LangChain and AutoGPT? How can we ensure that prompt modification does not lead to unfair comparisons?""**\n\nThanks for pointing these out, but these are misunderstandings.\n**(1) Both the baselines and MetaGPT are conducted under the same settings.** We acknowledge that comparing MetaGPT with single LLMs may seem partially unfair. However, our goal is to help readers quickly grasp the advancements in this field, where both LLMs (PaLM Code vs. GPT-4) and methodologies (Codex vs. Codex+CodeT) are essential. The most important point here is ""When MetaGPT collaborates with GPT-4, it substantially improves the Pass@1 in the HumanEval benchmark, exceeding the performance of GPT-4 alone"" as stated in the manuscript.\n**(2) In the SoftwareDev dataset, we maintain fully equivalent settings for a fair comparison with AutoGPT, LangChain, and ChatDev.** In HumanEval and MBPP, we\'ve slightly modified the prompts to align with response format requirements. These modifications aim to address format-specific issues (i.e., Python problems). To enhance clarity in our manuscript, we propose adding \'In HumanEval and MBPP\' at the beginning of Sec 4.1.\n\n---\n\n**Q4 (Original Q3). Statements: ""MetaGPT achieves a 100% task completion rate, further demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of our design"", and ""Our innovative integration of human-like SOPs throughout MetaGPT\'s design significantly enhances its robustness"". What is the definition of ""robustness"" here?**\n\n**Robustness** refers to the ability to generate software codes that can complete various tasks with consistent quality and adhere to specific designs. ï¼Figure 5 & Table 6ï¼Existing experiments support these claims. For example: 1) In Figure 5, we display many demos generated by MetaGPT, demonstrating its robustness to generate different software. 2) In Table 4 & Table 6 (Appendix), we have shown that MetaGPT can generate high-quality software aligned with expectations.\n\n---'}}, {'title': {'value': ""Thanks for your review!

The communication topology involves a global message pool and a subscription mechanism to prevent information overload (btw, the term âinformation overloadâ s not really explain why it should matter for LLM agents since one may think it would not, though the meaning is intuitive, and I suspect many readers will have observed the phenomenon with LLMs themselves anyway).**\n\nWe agree with your opinion that whether \'information overload\' becomes an issue depends on the specific applications. In MetaGPT, **information overload refers to situations where agents receive more information than necessary**, for example, irrelevant messages. MetaGPT adopts the message pool to streamline one-to-one communication (refer to Sec 3.2, Message Pool), while the subscription mechanism (see Sec 3.2, Subscription Mechanism) can enhance the efficiency of context utilization by automatically filtering relevant contexts.  **In our software design scenarios and the corresponding SOPs, there is a need for more efficient and valuable communication. That\'s why MetaGPT needs to take \'information overload\' into consideration.**\n\n---\n\n**Q3. One question: how specific is this work to the specific SOP of a software company? Could you easily create a different kind of company, say a design company? Or an architecture firm? Maybe an artistâs workshop? Or an academic research lab? How do you actually specify an SOP? Is it essentially the config file for the entire experiment? Or is it backed in more deeply in code perhaps? Do you have to write code to change the SOP?**\n\nIt\'s an interesting question. The MetaGPT framework, adaptable for various industries, allows users to build new agent teams by modifying code. As detailed in Sec. 3.1 and Sec. 3.2, this involves three steps:   \n* 1) Configuring profiles, action functions, and tools for new agents.\n* 2) Defining each agent\'s structured interface, including data types and formats.\n* 3) Establishing the team\'s workflow and action sequence.\n\nAfter the initial setup, MetaGPT enables creating specialized teams without further code modifications.\n\n---\n\n**We appreciate your time in reading our feedback and look forward to further discussion and your suggestions.**'}}, {'title': {'value': ""Thanks for your review!

Is it accessible by humans during or after the process?**\n\nDuring the running, **humans can actively watch the inputs and outputs of each role in the terminal.** MetaGPT also automatically saves the intermediate files, such as PDFs, PNGs, Python code, etc., during the execution. Humans can easily access them after the process.\n\n---\n\n**Q7. Would the system ever need human interaction, or further input from human to address its potential questions?**\n\nThis is a good question. In our design, **in order to strengthen full automation (honestly speaking, it is more appealing)**, we proactively ignored human interactions. However, **we also provide an interface, and humans can easily interact with MetaGPT if they want**, such as helping to debug the code or revise the PRD. In terms of techniques, it is not hard to achieve.\n\n---\n\n**Q8. There are multiple agents introduced in the system each with different roles, however, it is never discussed how are these specialized agents built or trained, algorithmically. Are they using specifically trained models?**\n\nRegarding the construction of agents, we define each role\'s profile, name, goal, and constraints, while also initializing their specific context and skills, which is stated in the first paragraph Sec. 3.1 and illustrated in Figure 2 (right). We employ GPT-4 as the only trained model and the default LLM backend for all agents. It is noteworthy that, in terms of experiment cost, other open-source LLMs can be used flexibly in MetaGPT, such as using CodeX [5] for Engineers.\n\n[5] Chen M, Tworek J, Jun H, et al.

Can there be multiple agents with the same role? i.e., multiple engineers that would work on different parts of implementations in parallel? Howâs the parallelization process performed? For example, if multiple engineers will be working different parts of the problem designated by the architect, how will they choose which part to work on? Is there priority assigned, or is there a decision-making problem being solved? Sometimes the order by which a problem is solved could significantly affect its efficiency.**\n\nThank you for bringing up a professional question. In our earlier version, we incorporated a simplified approach to handle multiple engineers working on the same project. Although different agents could write different code files simultaneously, it didn\'t necessarily guarantee an improvement in the overall output quality of the project. We agree that processing dependencies between files and modules poses a more complex decision-making problem.\n\n---\n\n**Q10. What are some of the limitations of the system at its current stage?

Furthermore, despite generating the most amount of code among comparable frameworks, it remains challenging to fulfill real-world applications\' diverse and complex requirements.\n\n2) **Human user side**: A key challenge for users is to interrupt the running process of each agent, or set the starting running point (checkpoint) for each agent.  \n\n---\n\n**We appreciate your time in reading our feedback and look forward to further discussion and your suggestions.**'}}, {'title': {'value': ""Thanks for your review!

(2) How primal/high-level the initial instructions can be? For instance, is a novice user going to have a hard time using this because they donât have enough knowledge about breaking an initial task into sub-steps?**\n\n(1) For developers, it\'s correct that multi-agent frameworks typically require humans to pre-define the agents (which need existing expertise and strategy). However, for users, we have already completed these definitions, enabling users to generate software directly without significant barriers.\n\n(2) There is no need to break down an initial task; users can use very basic instructions, such as \'design a Flappy Bird game\' or \'write a Python3 GUI app where you can draw an image\', etc. The subsequent processes are automated by MetaGPT, making it user-friendly. Additional examples can be found in rows 0-2, 4, 9-10 of Table 5 (Appendix), with their corresponding performances outlined in Table 6 (Appendix).\n\n---\n\n**Q3. Does the level of initial input from human affect the performance? For instance, if the human gives a very high-level input vs a more detailed, structured input instruction?**\n\nThanks for these valuable comments. We conduct additional experiments to verify your questions. Here, we first give two examples of prompts:  \n* **High-level prompt**: `Create a brick breaker game.`\n* **Detailed prompt**: `Creating a brick breaker game. In a brick breaker game, the player typically controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball towards a wall of bricks. The goal is to break all the bricks by hitting them with the ball.`\n\nWe select 5 tasks from SoftwareDev, and construct detailed prompts for them. Here are the experimental results:\n\n|$\\textbf{Model}$|$\\textbf{Num. of word}$|$\\textbf{Running time(s)}$|$\\textbf{Token usage}$|$\\textbf{Total Code Lines}$|$\\textbf{Executability}$|$\\textbf{Productivity}$|$\\textbf{Human Revision Cost}$|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|$\\textbf{High-level prompt}$|$13.2$|$552.9$|$28384.2$|$178.2$|$3.8$|$163.8$|$1.2$|\n|$\\textbf{Detailed prompt}$  |$42.2$|$567.8$|$29657.0$|$257.0$|$4.0$|$118.0$|$1.6$|\n\nWe observe that: **detailed prompts lead to better software projects with lower productivity ratios because of clearer requirements and functions, while simple inputs can still generate good enough software using MetaGPT with an executability rating of 3.8, which is comparable to the detailed prompt scenario.** (Note that, Productivity = Token usage / Total Code Lines. The lower this ratio, the better.)\n\n---\n\n**Q4. The human user side of the system is never discussed, although I believe itâs very critical to understand the requirements, skills, knowledge, etc. the system imposes on or requires from a human user.

Can you share some insight on which abilities of the LLMs matter most for the success of using this multi-agent framework and how to choose proper LLMs for use?**\n\nIn our experience, coding tasks need GPT-4, while GPT-3.5 suffices for other tasks without obvious performance impact.

To illustrate, we\'ll use the task **\'write a python3 GUI app which allows drawing images on it\'** as an example (the intermediate processes involving full team members are detailed in Appendix B). Here, we provide a qualitative analysis of each role\'s contribution to the final performance.\n\nHere is the summary of the impact of removing certain agent roles:\n\n- **Without Architect:**\n  - An absence of detailed system design leads to structural and functional issues in coding, which affects the robustness of final product.\n  - Task decomposition lacks sufficient granularity.\n- **Without ProjectManager:**\n  - Missing module dependencies result in incomplete functionality and additional bugs.\n- **Without ProductManager:**\n  - Lack of function design and plan results in incomplete design and missing functionality, directly impacting the total number of files and generated code.\n\n\n---\n\n**Q4.

Itâs still nice to see that you can do this kind of ablation here though. In practice this kind of role ablation will likely end up being an important debugging and validation step to take whenever you apply this approach to a new problem.  \n\nOne question: how specific is this work to the specific SOP of a software company? Could you easily create a different kind of company, say a design company? Or an architecture firm? Maybe an artistâs workshop? Or an academic research lab? How do you actually specify an SOP?

I have several questions that I believe need to be addressed before publication. Aside from the questions below, my biggest concern is the relevance of the paper to Learning Representations. This paper mostly seems to be a nice fit for a journal focused on systems and applications.\n\n- It appears that this system needs existing expertise and strategy, correct? How primal/high-level the initial instructions can be? For instance, is a novice user going to have a hard time using this because they donât have enough knowledge about breaking an initial task into sub-steps?\n\n- Does the level of initial input from human affect the performance? For instance, if the human gives a very high-level input vs a more detailed, structured input instruction?\n\n- The human user side of the system is never discussed, although I believe itâs very critical to understand the requirements, skills, knowledge, etc. the system imposes on or requires from a human user. The initial task or input instructions from the user are also never discussed.\n\n- The paper uses the term collaborative multi-agent systems, but later mentions that they define multi-agent frameworks as LLM-based multi-agent systems. I think the term collaborative multi-agent systems is very broad and comprehensive and it could be misleading to readers. The âLLM-basedâ attribute of the multi-agent systems must be reflected in Title. Also, this leads to some misleading sentences such as âMost of current multi-agent frameworks utilize natural language as a communication interface.â Without using the term LLM-based multi-agent frameworks, this sentence is incorrect.\n\n- Is the shared communication/message pool interpretable to humans? Is it accessible by humans during or after the process?\n\n- Would the system ever need human interaction, or further input from human to address its potential questions?\n\n- There are multiple agents introduced in the system each with different roles, however, it is never discussed how are these specialized agents built or trained, algorithmically. Are they using specifically trained models?\n\n- Can there be multiple agents with the same role? i.e., multiple engineers that would work on different parts of implementations in parallel? Howâs the parallelization process performed? For example, if multiple engineers will be working different parts of the problem designated by the architect, how will they choose which part to work on? Is there priority assigned, or is there a decision-making problem being solved? Sometimes the order by which a problem is solved could significantly affect its efficiency.\n\n- What are some of the limitations of the system at its current stage? Limitations, both in the system and on the human user side must be discussed.\n\nAt current states I vote weak reject (mostly due to relevance), although the system seems to be sound and working.

I appreciated the additional analysis (especially Appendix D) and elaboration of the phenomena. I really appreciate the author's clear delineation between explanations supported by evidence vs. points they hypothesize or speculate about which allows the reader to easily understand the statements and contextualize the confidence behind them appropriately. Overall, my concerns have been addressed, and the discussion below is just engagement regarding the paper and is more subjective in nature than the review. \n\n**Connection to dataset bias**: \nI agree with the separation of two forms of bias. I will note that for curated datasets such as ImageNet and LVD, those biases are very closely intertwined due to the sampling being the direct result of either querying with keywords or clustered representations that depend on a specific class set. Although, those two factors likely affect LVD less due to the use of image features as queries. \n\nWhile the Torralba and Efros suggested using negatives, the results they report are quite mixed where it hurts performance on same datasets and benefits on others. The negative impact is attributed to negatives being correlated with the class, while the improvement on ImageNet is attributed to data variability. So it is unclear how applicable that statement is to the methods. At a high level, I agree with your analysis of two kinds of bias and that SSL is less susceptible to it, although curation might be a culprit here (as I discuss next). \n\nIt seems to me that while SSL does not require labels, they might require some amount of data curation. This is speculation on my side as I do not have concrete evidence to support this beyond some smaller scale experiments where I found that they perform poorly for less curated datasets. Some work in the literature does support this; eg, Assran et al [1] very nicely discusses the impact of the uniformity in dataset training and suggests that this is benefiting SSL methods. While they show results on subsets of the data sampled in various ways, the underlying data they are sampling from is still relatively curated. Furthermore, it remains unclear how DINO or DINOv2 would perform if trained on very large scale datasets without curation like LAION. Of course, I think this is an open question and lies well beyond the scope of your work, but one that is worth considering when contextualizing some of the results with respect to biases in the data or trying to understand the interplay between different learning signals and different types of data. \n\nOne final thing that I thought might be interest is the impact of the choice of layer for conducting this analysis, especially when thinking about the CLIP numbers. Walmer et al [1] similarly analyze the features learned by transformers and find that in some cases, representations of intermediate layers have more information regarding specific objectives such as clustering for parts vs. objects. I was curious if some of those findings would impact the analysis does in Appendix C as well as your second hypothesis regarding the difference between DINO and DINOv2's performance on LOST being attributed to the granularity of objects/parts being represented. I think that your point about MIM encouraging more part representations is likely the correct explanation, but it is also possible that it simply shifts where different aspects of the image are represented in the network. \n\n\nReferences: \n  1.

We answer the questions below:\n\n\n> 1. While adding additional token (registers) seems like a simple and efficacious approach, I\'m wondering if it\'s the only possible solution for reducing patch level redundancy. Did the authors observe similar effects across other self-supervised models, like MAE, where nominally the patch-level reconstruction should also alleviate representational redundancy?\n\nWe agree there probably exist other solutions that could work. On MAE, our experiments seem to show that it does not exhibit the same ""outlier patches"" as the other models. We believe it may be linked to the fact that MAE was trained only with a local loss, there might be no need (or less need) to aggregate global information anywhere, and thus these outliers may not be needed. However, we also believe that relying only on a local loss is the reason leading to a poor performance for representation learning: MAE-ViT-Large only reaches 75% classification accuracy with linear probing, which is way below the other SSL methods.\nWe expand on this in Appendix E.  \n\n\n> 2. In demonstrating that the artifacts hold global information, the authors ""choose a single token at random, either high-norm or normal,"" and then ""train a logistic regression classifier to predict the image class from this representation, and measure the accuracy."" Why choose this token at random? Why not use all the high-norm and normal tokens, or some projected and pooled version over all of them in order to regress to the class? In experiments we have conducted, this almost always outperforms using single tokens (cls or otherwise), and it may be the case that the conclusion that the high-norm tokens outperform the ""normal"" tokens is not so clear when this is done.\n\nThe goal of this experiment is to compare the global information contained in the different kinds of patches (individually) and assess whether outlier tokens are closer to the CLS token, which holds global information, or closer to non-outlier patch tokens, that hold local information. \n\nIn order to perform token-to-token comparison, we estimate the average performance for individual patches over the dataset, and randomly choosing a token allows this estimation; in order to confirm that this approach is sound, we also provide standard deviation numbers in the manuscript (see updated Table 6 in Appendix G) obtained across runs.\n\nWhile we agree that the performance of average-pooled patches is expected to be much stronger than individual patches, this appears misaligned with our goal of characterizing the outlier tokens in contrast to the other token types individually.\n\n\n\n> 3. There seems to be a conflict between the fact that ""high-norm tokens appear on patches that are very similar to their neighbors,"" ""often appear[ing] in uniform, background areas,"" and the fact that performance on ImageNet classification improves almost monotonically with more registers, but not dense tasks like segmentation or depth estimation. In particular, I would expect that if reappropriating the ""redundant"" local patches helps on object-centric classification, it should help much more substantially on tasks that are even more reliant on good (non-redundant?) local information (i.e. segmentation or depth estimation). Can the authors comment on this?\n\nThanks for pointing out this apparent conflict. Adding register tokens has two effects :\n- First, adding registers removes the need for high-norm artifacts in the feature maps. This effect is visible with one register both qualitatively and quantitatively (see Fig. 8). With n=1, artifacts disappear from the attention maps, ImageNet classification accuracy is unchanged (+0.05), while segmentation and depth prediction are significantly improved (+0.6 mIoU and -0.1 RMSE). \n- Second, when adding more registers, another behavior emerges. Segmentation and depth prediction performance does not improve much (because the feature maps are now already clean), but classification performance improves further. We agree with the reviewer that this is surprising; we do not have a clear intuition yet of why additional registers improve classification performance and hope this can be answered in future research.'}}, {'comment': {'value': '> I found the first line in page 9 a bit confusing. As I understand it, Torralba and Efros (2011) were arguing that datasets themselves were biased, not that the specific labels were. Such concerns still apply whether or not the data is labels or the training paradigm used for training as the bias arises from the data source and sampling process. While the samping process would be affected by the target labels, one can still get a biased dataset based solely on the data source (eg, instagram vs. inaturalist). Could you please elaborate on your statement and what you meant?\n\nThanks for pointing that out; you are right that the Torralba & Efros paper focuses on the datasets themselves, and the citation was mainly to acknowledge that they have popularized the term âdataset biasâ; however your question is sound and we would like to further clarify what we meant in the following way:\n\nWe believe datasets are biased in at least two ways: how the labels are determined and how the images are sampled. SSL can negate some of the bias related to labels. For example, one can imagine a dataset of dog images, labeled as male/female. The (image, labels) pairs would, in that case, entirely ignore the breeds of the dogs. In contrast, SSL would attempt to cluster samples from a given breed together.\n\nAdditionally, as SSL does not rely on labels, multiple datasets can be easily concatenated together for training jointly, as the labels do not need to be compatible. This would, in particular, resonate with the âNegative Set Biasâ paragraph at the end of the Torralba & Efros paper, where the authors recommend using negatives from other datasets in order to model the rest of the visual world better and therefore reduce image selection biases.\n\nIf possible, we would like to get feedback from Reviewer mTMB. If our analysis is reasonable, we will update the text with a reformulation of the ideas presented above. Otherwise, we will clarify to separate dataset biases from labeling biases and avoid confusion related to citing that paper.\n\n\n\n> (Suggestion) The paper suggests that this outlier token is exhibited by larger models in Fig 4/Sec 2.2, yet the base model of CLIP/DEIT is used in Sec 3.1. While Fig 7 still shows that the base models of those models exhibit outlier tokens, it would be nice for the authors to add some commentary on this at the end of sec 2.2.\n\n\nIt seems that the conditions for the apparition of these outliers are multiple. Both larger models and models trained for longer seem more vulnerable. However, OpenCLIP and DeiT-III indeed show outliers at sizes smaller than DINOv2, indicating that the pretraining paradigm does also play a significant role. We agree that this may have been unclear, and have updated section 2.2 with a discussion on this part.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Answers to the questions raised in review'}, 'comment': {'value': ""We thank reviewer mTMB for their remarks and their thoughtful review. We answer the questions below:\n\n> Do the registers inherit the behavior exhibited by the outlier tokens? Specifically, are they good predictors of global image information as shown in Table 1?\n\nIt appears that registers inherit the behavior of outliers. We detail this analysis in Appendix D in the paper and thank the reviewer for this question. This additional experiment fills a gap in our analysis. \n\n\n> Could you clarify on the discrepancy in OpenCLIP performance in Table 3 vs Sec 3.3? I wasn't sure if it's a missed negative result or a typo in the table.\n\nReviewer eoPK brought up the same point. We apologize for the mistake in the text due to an oversight on our part; the claim that registers improve object discovery in all models is not supported by the numbers presented, as there is a slight loss in performance for the OpenCLIP model. We corrected this and improved the main text accordingly in Section 3.3. In order to complement this observation, we provide a more thorough analysis in Appendix C. \n\n\n> Do the image tokens revert back to being more local in nature with the addition of tokens? How do they perform on the tasks exhibited in Table 1 and Figure 5?\n\nWe performed the corresponding measurements in Table 5 (Appendix D2) and show that the image tokens (in a model trained with registers) match the performance of non-outlier tokens (in a model trained without registers).\n\n\n> How does the norm of the CLS token compare to the outliers before and after the addition of register tokens? It would be interesting to see if it matches the outlier tokens across conditions as shown in Figure 4, although simply reporting it on the final model would provide some insight into the internal mechanisms of ViTs.\n\nWe conducted an additional experiment to study this matter. Appendix D.1 shows a plot of the norms of all the tokens output by the vision transformer, split by token type. We compute these norms on a random sample of images taken from ImageNet-22k. We observe that with and without registers, the norm of the CLS token is consistently low, with no outliers. Interestingly, the high-norm outliers observed in the patch tokens now appear in the register tokens.\n\n\n> Could you please comment on why you think LOST with DINO still performs better that with DINOv2? Is it the data (ImageNet vs LVD), newer training objective, some other factor?\n\nWe do not have a decisive answer to that question, and can only formulate initial hypotheses :\n- First, the LOST method was specifically designed in conjunction with the DINO models. The heuristics involved in this work were tuned specifically for the attention maps of DINO models. Our intuition is that some amount of performance was lost to this procedure: we have not spent as much effort tweaking this method - it is not part of our core contribution.\n- Second, DINOv2 tends to discern regions more finely, distinguishing object parts on top of full objects. Our intuition is that DINO was trained in a more object-centric setup (no masked image modeling, training on ImageNet-1k), which fits the object discovery setup better.\n\n\n\n> It seems suprising that DINOv2 exhibits this behavior while using a dense mask-image-modeling objective. I was curious if you had any thoughts on why the masked image objective did not discourage such behavior despite requiring the patch features to retain the information that you show is lost in Fig 5b\n\nThis is a very good question. In DINOv2, the masked image modeling loss is applied on [MASK] tokens with a position embedding, and not on visible image tokens. In informal experiments, we have observed that the outliers appear only on visible tokens and never on [MASK] tokens. The visible patch tokens themselves are not used for computing any loss, meaning their high norm is not discouraged by the training objective. However, the fact that outliers do not appear on [MASK] tokens suggests, in line with the remark of the reviewer, that receiving a loss signal discourages outliers.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Answers to the questions raised in review'}, 'comment': {'value': ""We thank reviewer GGy7 for their remarks and their thoughtful review. We answer the questions below:\n\nAlthough this was not noted as a weakness, we would like to add a precision about the relationship with Memory Transformers (Burtsev et al.). We included this reference as it is, to our knowledge, the only previous case of adding similar additional tokens to the input sequence in transformers. However, this was only done in the goal of increasing the scores for NLP tasks. The analysis of artifacts in the features, and the idea of adding new tokens to fix these artifacts, is specific to our analysis. We hope this clarifies the relationship with the previous literature.\n\n> One very interesting observation was how the different register tokens end up focussing on the different areas of interest on the object. If there are spatially discrete areas of focus for the registers, does this undermine the argument that we need them for storing global information which was earlier being done using redundant patches?\n\nWe added visualizations describing the positional focus of the different registers, by showing averaged attention maps over a dataset, in Appendix D3. It appears that the areas of focus for the registers have a larger extent on average and cover wider areas, similar to the CLS token, and different of the patch tokens that are much more local in nature. We want to point out that in the example in Figure 9, the registers attend to all objects present in the image (hence global), but with a slightly stronger focus on individual objects depending on the register observed. Therefore, the focus is not discrete and we think it does not undermine the argument around storing global information.\n\n> Not a weakness, but would be nice to see some norm-related metrics and/or visualizations for the outlier tokens across different heads. Do all the heads from these tokens end up getting these tokens repurposed? What does that variance across heads look like?\n\nWe added a visualization per attention head for the outliers, in Appendix G. The analysis shows that most heads are similarly affected by the presence of outliers, with a few heads focusing a bit more on the objects.\n\n> I'm curious if other simple solutions like penalizing these high norms could work as well and if yes, would they be preferable? Would love to hear from the authors on other ways to address this issue.\n\nIt is definitely possible that other valid solutions may exist. For the context of this paper, we preferred focusing on what we felt was the most natural fix, but penalizing the high norms of the patch tokens may be indeed another possibility. To study this hypothesis, we launched a few pretraining runs of DINOv2 ViT-L with a penalization on the L2 norm with various hyperparameters. The result of these runs is not available yet, but we believe that it might be treating a symptom rather than the cause: if the model still needs some place to store global information, it might still do it while keeping the norms low. In contrast to our approach, regularization of the norms induces more hyperparameters that can be difficult to tune, and no opportunities for exploiting outputs of the model.\n\n> Any reason why adding more registers hurts performance for NYU depth dataset?\n\nWhen going from 8 to 16 registers, the sequence length is increased by a non-negligible amount, and this can lead to a different optimal set of hyperparameters for training. Since the Fig.8 experiment was conducted with constant hyperparameters, the optimisation may be a culprit for the slight increase in rmse when using 16 registers. The goal of the figure was to point out that there was a clear step effect when going from 0 to 1 register (matching the qualitative effect of removing artifacts), and only smaller effects when adding more registers.\n\nAlternatively, the small difference in results (0.03 RMSE for 8->16 regs, compared to 0.1 RMSE for 0->1 reg) could be simply noise.\n\n\n> What happens to downstream performance when registers are added to DINO models which do not seem to need it? Does the nature of what registers learn differ from the case of DINOv2?\n\nThis is an interesting idea, and we are not sure of the answer. We do not expect the patch tokens to be improved (as there are no outliers), but the classification performance may increase (as in fig. 8).\nIn order to understand this better, we launched a new pretraining of DINOv2 ViT-B with 4 registers.

However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we uncover a vexing propensity of diffusion models: they frequently exhibit the infinite Lipschitz near the zero point of timesteps. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point. Remarkably, our technique yields a substantial improvement in performance. Moreover, as a byproduct of our method, we achieve a dramatic reduction in the FrÃ©chet Inception Distance of acceleration methods relying on network Lipschitz, including DDIM and DPM-Solver, by over 33\%.

According to Theorem 5.2.1 (Existence and uniqueness theorem for stochastic differential equations) in the book you mentioned (Ãksendal, 2003), for a general SDE ${\\rm d} X_t = b(t, X_t){\\rm d}t + \\sigma(t, X_t){\\rm d}B_t$, an unique strong solution exists if measurable functions $b(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ and $\\sigma(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ are bounded and globally Lipschitz in state. Thus, if the infinite Lipschitz constants in time can break either of these two conditions, the SDE may not have a unique strong solution.\n\nHowever, in diffusion models, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, a unique strong solution exists in $[\\epsilon, T]$ since the above two conditions are satisfied. Multiple solutions can only exist at the zero point. Thus, we can cut off $[0, \\epsilon]$ as proposed in previous milestone works (Song et al., 2021a,b; Vahdat et al., 2021), and this will not hurt the practical performance in most cases with a suitable $\\epsilon$.\n\nIt is worth noting that the cut-off $\\epsilon$ should be small enough to avoid performance degradation. Thus, near $t=\\epsilon$, the Lipschitz constants in time may still be large, and this can also lead to numerical instability in both training and inference. As demonstrated in our work, the instability issues can be significantly mitigated with our proposed method.\n\nAll in all, the uniqueness of the solution is an important and interesting question, and thank you for your suggestion again.

The aforementioned works indeed observed numerical instability issues near zero point, which are of great importance. **However, it is distinct from our work.** The numerical issues observed by previous works are mainly caused by the **singularity of the Gaussian transition kernel $q_{0t}(x_t|x_0)$ as $\\sigma_t \\rightarrow 0$**. However, our observation is *the infinite Lipschitz constants of the noise prediction model $\\epsilon_\\theta(x, t)$ w.r.t time variable $t$*, which are caused by **the explosion of ${\\rm d}\\sigma_t / {\\rm d}t$, but not $\\sigma_0=0$**. **To the best of our knowledge, the infinite Lipschitz constants are not pointed out by these works**. Besides, large Lipschitz constants near zero will pose a significant threat to both training and inference: during training, it can hurt the training on other timesteps due to the smooth nature of the neural network; during inference, it can affect the accuracy of numerical integration. **Such instability issues can not be well solved by the methods of previous works**. **Therefore, our work explores a different topic from previous works**. We believe the observation of the instability issues caused by the infinite Lipschitz constants, combined with our proposed solution to mitigate the instability, constitutes a good contribution to the diffusion model community.\n\n**Detailed analysis**\nWhile we have added further discussion in the related-work section (**Section 2**) of our paper, we also give a brief summary of the numerical issue observed by each related work and our work as below:\n\n**Song et al., 2021a:** In this work, it is mentioned in **section 4.3** that numerical instabilities exist when $t\\rightarrow 0$. However, the authors don't point out what kind of numerical instability issue it is, and they don't provide any further analysis of the reasons behind the problem.\n\n**Vahdat et al., 2021:** In this work, it is pointed out in **Appendix G.4** that integration of probability flow ODE should be cut off close to zero since $\\sigma_t$ goes to zero at $t=0$. However, there is no explanation why $\\sigma_t \\rightarrow 0$ makes integration cutoff necessary.\n\n**Song et al., 2021b:** This work is cited by Vahdat et al., 2021. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes to cut off near zero during training and sampling for diffusion models. Specifically, it is pointed out in **Appendix C** that the variance of $x_t$ in the Gaussian perturbation kernel $p_{0t}(x_t | x_0)$ vanishes as $t \\rightarrow 0$. This vanishing variance can cause numerical instability issues for training and sampling at $t=0$. Therefore, computation is restricted to $t \\in [\\epsilon, 1]$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$, *i.e.*, the cutoff strategy mentioned in Vahdat et al., 2021. Indeed, when the variance of $x_t$, denoted as $\\sigma_t^2$, goes to zero, the Gaussian perturbation kernel $p_{0t}(x_t | x_0)=\\mathcal{N}(x_t; \\alpha_t x_0, \\sigma_t^2 {\\bf I}) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sigma_t^d}\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_t^2}\\Vert x(t) - \\alpha_t x_0\\Vert^2)$ will degrade to a Dirac kernel $\\delta(x_t - \\alpha_t x_0)$, and its log gradient $\\nabla_{x_t} \\log p_{0t}(x_t | x_0) = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma_t^2}(x_t - \\alpha_t x_0)$ is not well defined when $\\sigma_t=0$. As the score-based model $s_\\theta(x, t)$ is directly optimized by denoising score matching with learning objective $\\mathcal{L}_ t^{\\rm score} = \\mathbb{E}_ {x_ 0, x_ t}[\\Vert s_ \\theta(x, t) - \\nabla_ {x_ t} \\log p_ {0t}(x_ t | x_ 0)\\Vert _ 2^2 ]$, an ill-defined $\\nabla_{x_t} \\log p_{0t}(x_t | x_0)$ at $t=0$ can cause numerical issues, as mentioned in Song et al., 2021b.""}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Dear reviewer, We extend our gratitude for acknowledging the significance of our research.

If there are any misunderstandings, please let us know.\n\n**1) This method can be classified as ""Remap"" mentioned in our paper.**\nIn reality, this method can be classified as one of the alternative methods mentioned in our paper, *i.e.*, Remap (Please refer to the ""Comparison with some alternative methods"" part in **Section 4** and **Section D.3.3** in the appendix). The core idea behind Remap is to design a remap function $\\lambda=f(t)$ as the network\'s conditional input instead of directly utilizing $t$, *i.e.*, $\\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, \\lambda)$. In this particular case, we set $\\lambda = \\sigma_t$.\n\n**2) Analysis of Remap, where the remap function is $\\lambda = \\sigma_t$**\nThe performance of Remap relies heavily on whether sampling is performed uniformly based on $t$ or $\\lambda$ during both training and inference. **1) Uniformly sampling $t$:** As discussed in our paper, if the sampling strategy remains consistent (uniformly sampling $t$) during both training and inference, Remap has no impact on $\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t)}{\\partial t}$. As a result, Remap may yield similar performance to the baseline. **2) Uniformly sampling $\\lambda:$** However, if there is a change in the sampling strategy (uniformly sampling $\\lambda=f(t)$, i.e. $\\sigma_t$ here) during training **or** inference, the inference results may deteriorate, similarly to the examples shown in our paper. This occurs because the equivalent schedule may compel the network to focus on specific stages of the entire process. For instance, taking $\\lambda=\\sigma_t$ as an example, where $\\sigma_{999} = 1.0000$, $\\sigma_{782}= 0.9990$, and $\\sigma_{0}= 0.01$. If we uniformly sample $\\sigma_t$ during training, timesteps falling within the range $t\\in(782, 999)$ will rarely undergo training. We provide additional examples of remap functions, with a quantitative evaluation provided in **Figure 3**, along with a detailed analysis in the ""Comparison with some alternative methods"" section in **Section 4** and **Section D.3.3** in the appendix.\n\nBesides, it is important to note that $\\lambda=\\sigma_t$ is a special remap function. The difference of $\\sigma_{t}$ and $\\sigma_{t-1}$ gets extremely small near $t=T$. This characteristic may hinder the network\'s training process, as it is hard for the network to distinguish adjacent timesteps with extremely similar conditional inputs. Consequently, learning $\\epsilon_\\theta(x, \\sigma_t)$ may yield poorer performance than the baseline, as confirmed by the experimental results presented in the following table.\n\n**Table3. Quantitative comparison between using $\\sigma_t$ as conditions and the baseline on FFHQ $256\\times 256$.**\n| Method | FID-10k |\n| --- | --- |\n| $\\epsilon_\\theta(x, \\sigma_t)$ | 16.41|\n| Baseline | 9.50 |\n\n\n**3.

Additionally, we extend our utmost appreciation for your invaluable advice. We firmly believe that these suggestions hold the potential to enhance the quality of our paper.\n\n**1. This work reveals the inherent price of predicting noise.**\nYour astute observation regarding our work's revelation of the inherent cost associated with predicting noise instead of directly learning $\\nabla \\log q_ t(x)$ is greatly appreciated. We wholeheartedly concur with your insightful perspective. In response to this, we have included detailed discussions about this viewpoint within **Section 2** (Related Works) of our paper. Specifically, we begin by introducing the challenges associated with directly learning the score function, followed by an exposition on commonly employed noise-prediction models. Ultimately, we emphasize that our research reveals the inherent drawbacks of noise-prediction models.\n\n**2. Reply for questions about alternative methods**\nFollowing your recommendations, we have incorporated four additional experiments on FFHQ $256\\times 256$ into our research. The evaluation metric used for these experiments is FID-10k. To ensure fairness, we have maintained the same experimental settings as those employed in the baseline.\n\n**Q1: Directly learning $\\nabla \\log q_t(x)$ with least square and with weighted least square.**\n**A1:** In accordance with your analysis, directly learning $\\nabla \\log q_t(x)$ with least square presents challenges, especially with a small $\\sigma_t$. We have implemented this approach and present a quantitative comparison in the table below. The experimental results affirm that directly learning $\\nabla \\log q_t(x)$ using the least square method is not feasible.\n\nMoreover, we have also attempted to learn $\\nabla \\log q_t(x)$ using a weighted least square approach. Specifically, we aimed to learn $\\theta^* = \\arg\\min_ {\\theta} \\mathbb{E}_ t \\left[ \\sigma_t^2\\mathbb{E}_ {x}\\left[ \\Vert s_ \\theta(x, t) - \\nabla \\log q_ {0t}(x|x_0) \\Vert_2^2\\right] \\right] $. Intuitively, the weighted least square method should outperform the original least square method, as it mitigates the influence of problematic intervals. As depicted in the subsequent table, learning $\\nabla \\log q_t(x)$ with the weighted least square method yields significantly superior results compared to direct learning with the least square method.\n\n**Table1. Quantitative comparison between directly learning $\\nabla \\log q_t(x)$ with the least square and the baseline on FFHQ $256\\times 256$.**\n| Method | FID-10k |\n| --- | --- |\n| Learning $\\nabla \\log q_t(x)$ with LS | 97.96|\n| Learning $\\nabla \\log q_t(x)$ with weighted LS | 13.87 |\n| Baseline | 9.50 |\n\n**Q2: What if we only learn the score function for time $f_T(t)$ and only use those time steps to do sampling.**\n**A2:** This method exhibits inferior performance compared to the baseline. The experimental results for FFHQ $256\\times 256$ are presented in the table below. Specifically, when $t \\ge 100$, we train the score function for $t=100, 101, \\dots, T-1$, and when $t < 100$, we only train the score function for $t = 0, 20, 40, 60, 80$. During inference, we exclusively employ the timesteps of $f_T(t)$ for sampling. Likewise, the baseline method also restricts sampling to the timesteps of $f_T(t)$. The experimental results, depicted in the subsequent table, demonstrate the inferior performance of this method compared to the baseline.\n\nAlthough sampling in our method is limited to the timesteps of $f_T(t)$ ($t = 0, 20, 40, 60, 80$ when $t < 100$), training on additional timesteps can provide valuable information and enhance the network's denoising capabilities. By solely learning from the timesteps of $f_T(t)$, the network struggles to capture information from other timesteps, resulting in subpar performance. On the other hand, if we adopt our proposed method to train on all timesteps but limit sampling to the timesteps of $f_T(t)$ , then it becomes the situation of DDIM sampling. The outcomes of DDIM are presented in **Table 3** of our paper. However, if we extend the sampling to all timesteps, it will further enhance the performance.\n\n**Table2. Quantitative comparison between only training for time $f_T(t)$ and the baseline on FFHQ $256\\times 256$.**\n| Method | FID-10k |\n| --- | --- |\n| Training on all $f_T(t)$, sampling on $f_T(t)$ | 48.15|\n| Training on all $t$, sampling on $f_T(t)$ (Baseline) | 21.75 |""}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We extend our sincere appreciation to all the reviewers for their invaluable feedback, which greatly aids in refining our work.

So far, GNN expressiveness has been primarily assessed via the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. However, such an expressivity measure has notable limitations: it is inherently coarse, qualitative, and may not well reflect practical requirements (e.g., the ability to encode substructures). In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for quantitatively studying the expressiveness of GNN architectures, addressing all the above limitations. Specifically, we identify a fundamental expressivity measure termed homomorphism expressivity, which quantifies the ability of GNN models to count graphs under homomorphism. Homomorphism expressivity offers a complete and practical assessment tool: the completeness enables direct expressivity comparisons between GNN models, while the practicality allows for understanding concrete GNN abilities such as subgraph counting. By examining four classes of prominent GNNs as case studies, we derive simple, unified, and elegant descriptions of their homomorphism expressivity for both invariant and equivariant settings. Our results provide novel insights into a series of previous work, unify the landscape of different subareas in the community, and settle several open questions.

By substituting ""if and only if"" in Definition 3.2(a) with ""implies,"" the homomorphism expressivity becomes well-defined for all GNN models. However, while this modification results in a better definition from the perspective of *universality*, it comes at the cost of forfeiting a critical attribute of homomorphism expressivityâcompleteness. This is extremely important and distinguishes our work from previously proposed expressivity measures. The absence of completeness would render most results in Section 4, including expressivity comparisons between GNN models and subgraph counting power, unattainable. Details are as follows:\n- **Section 4.1 (Expressivity comparisons between GNN models)**\n\n  Suppose that we have two models $M_1$ and $M_2$ and $\\mathcal F^{M_1}\\subset \\mathcal F^{M_2}$. We want to prove that $M_2$ is more powerful than $M_1$, namely, for any two graphs indistinguishable by $M_2$, they are also indistinguishable by $M_1$. The derivation is shown below.\n  - Pick two graphs $G,H$ such that $\\chi^{M_2}_G(G)=\\chi^{M_2}_H(H)$\n  - $\\implies$ $\\mathsf{hom}(F,G)=\\mathsf{hom}(F,H)$ for all $F\\in \\mathcal F^{M_2}$\n  - $\\implies$ $\\mathsf{hom}(F,G)=\\mathsf{hom}(F,H)$ for all $F\\in \\mathcal F^{M_1}$ (since $\\mathcal F^{M_1}\\subset \\mathcal F^{M_2}$)\n  - $\\implies$ $\\chi^{M_1}_G(G)=\\chi^{M_1}_H(H)$\n  \n  Here, the last step uses of completeness of homomorphism expressivity. Without this property, making expressivity comparisons between GNN models becomes impossible. Similarly, $\\mathcal F^{M_1}\\subsetneq \\mathcal F^{M_2}$ no longer implies that $M_2$ is strictly more powerful than $M_1$. \n- **Section 4.2 (Subgraph counting power)**\n\n  Our central theorem states that a model $M$ can subgraph-count $F$ if and only if $\\mathsf{Spasm}(F)\\subset\\mathcal F^M$. The proof of this theorem crucially relies on the completeness of homomorphism expressivity (see the proof of Lemma G.5). Without completeness, one can easily construct a pathological GNN $M$ following our previous response, such that $\\mathsf{Spasm}(F)\\backslash\\mathcal F^M\\neq\\emptyset$ but $M$ can subgraph-count $F$.\n\nGiven the pivotal role of completeness in analyzing the expressivity and subgraph counting power and the practical satisfaction of this property by most GNN models, we believe that it would be beneficial to include it in the definition. On the other hand, we feel that it is necessary to add a remark to point out that completeness is not always satisfied and homomorphism expressivity may not exist for pathological GNN models, and we will definitely add these discussions in our paper.\n\n---\n\nFinally, we fully acknowledge that real-valued feature vectors play an important role in practical scenarios and cannot be tackled in our framework. We view this as an exciting research direction worthy of future exploration.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the detailed response. I would like to keep my initial positive assessment.\n\nThough there is a question from my initial review that was not addressed in the response, and I would appreciate your input on it. Correct me if I missed anything, but the reason that there exist models $M$ for which homomorphism expressivity is not defined is due to the ""if and only if"" in requirement (a) of Definition 3.1. As asked in my original review, say that we modify (a) to only require that, if the representations of two graphs are equal, then their homomorphism counts are equal for any $F \\in \\mathcal{F}_M$ (and not the other direction whereby if their homomorphism counts are the same then their representations are equal). Does this allow taking into account all possible models or is it incompatible with the results in the paper? This limitation of homomorphism expressivity that makes it not well-defined for all architectures seems somewhat artificial to me. In a sense, it penalizes models that are more expressive (since it is not defined for them).\n\nNote: Regarding features of vertices. As mentioned in my review, the limitation I see in homomorphism expressivity (and WL analyses as well) is that it disregards vertex features **beyond simple discrete labels**. In practice, vertices are often associated with real-valued feature vectors.

Below, we would like to give detailed responses to each of your comments and questions.\n\n**Regarding the definition of $\\mathcal F^M$.** This is an excellent question that deserves detailed discussions. First, we would like to clarify that, for a specific graph $F\\in\\mathcal F^M$, our definition does **not** imply that two graphs $G, H$ must have the same representation if $\\mathsf{hom}(F, G)=\\mathsf{hom}(F, H)$. Instead, according to our definition, two graphs $G, H$ must have the same representation if $\\mathsf{hom}(F, G)=\\mathsf{hom}(F, H)$ holds for **all** graphs $F\\in\\mathcal F^M$. Therefore, the homomorphism expressivity corresponding to the universal architecture in your example is still well-defined (as will be shown below). \n\nConsider a universal architecture that assigns different representations to any two non-isomorphic graphs. We will show that the homomorphism expressivity $\\mathcal F^M$ is the set of all graphs. The proof is quite straightforward:\n- First, it is clear that the universal architecture can count any graph under homomorphism.\n- It remains to prove that for any two graphs $G,H$, if $\\mathsf{hom}(F,G)=\\mathsf{hom}(F,H)$ holds for all graphs $F$, then $G$ is isomorphic to $H$. This is actually a celebrated result proved by LovÃ¡sz (1967). We thus conclude the proof.\n\nLovÃ¡sz, 1967. Operations with structures.\n\nWe now consider the general case and discuss whether homomorphism expressivity is always well-defined. We highlight that, for all common GNN architectures such as the ones studied in this paper and also a variety of architectures discussed in Reviewer TDGD, **their homomorphism expressivity all exists**. Nevertheless, there do exist pathological, *intentionally designed* GNNs such that the homomorphism expressivity is not well-defined. We give an example below.\n\nConsider a GNN $M$ that outputs the representation of graph $G$ as follows. If $G$ is a cycle, it outputs $(1,l)$ where $l$ is the length of the cycle. Otherwise, it outputs $(0,\\chi^\\mathsf{MP}_G(G))$, namely, running a MPNN on the graph. It follows that the GNN $M$ is more powerful than MPNN and can thus count all trees under homomorphism. Moreover, it cannot count other patterns under homomorphism, as the counterexample graphs $G, H$ for MPNN are not cycles and still apply here. Therefore, the homomorphism expressivity of $M$ should be exactly the family of all trees if it exists. However, the homomorphism information of all trees cannot determine the representation of model $M$ since $M$ is strictly more powerful than MPNN (e.g., it can distinguish between 6-cycle and two triangles). Therefore, we conclude that the homomorphism expressivity of $M$ does not exist.\n\nNote that the above GNN construction is inherently *unnatural* and hardly appears in practice, as it tailors the representation of specific ""corner-case"" graphs while employing a different model for other graphs. When a GNN is described via a *unified* message-passing formula, we cannot find any counterexample GNN model. **We conjecture that, for any GNN characterized by a color refinement algorithm that outputs stable colors, the homomorphism expressivity always exists.**'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer TDGD (Part 4/4)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""> **Question for broader impact.** So far, the paper only discusses the analysis result of the proposed framework on some existing GNN variants. I am wondering if the authors could discuss how the proposed framework can be used to analyze new GNN variants when it is proposed or how could other researchers design new powerful and efficient GNN variants based on this analysis framework.\n\nThank you for raising this very insightful question. As discussed in the previous response, we truly believe that our proposed framework can universally apply to a broad range of popular GNN architectures proposed before and even in the future. Below, we give some tips and examples on $(\\mathrm{i})$ how to derive the homomorphism expressivity when a new architecture is proposed and $(\\mathrm{ii})$ how to guide the design of provably powerful architectures using our framework.\n\n- When a new GNN variant is proposed, one may first identify the order of the GNN, i.e., how the computational complexity grows w.r.t. the number of graph vertices. Typically, we will need the $k$-order ear to describe homomorphism expressivity if the GNN order is $k$ (i.e., a worst-case complexity of $O(n^{k+1})$ for a graph of $n$ vertices). Then, we need to specify how different ears can nest on each other. This paper gives a general analyzing procedure: we can gain insights into the structure of NED from the *unfolding tree* of a GNN model. We note that the unfolding tree is a standard tool in analyzing GNN expressivity and has been extensively used in prior work. In this paper, we show that for most architectures, the structure of the unfolding tree is deeply linked to a specific type of tree decomposition, which is then linked to the structure of NED. We believe this analysis framework is universal and should apply to future GNN models.\n\n- We next discuss how our framework can guide the design of provably powerful architectures. As an example, let's consider the task of designing a GNN that is provably powerful for encoding 8-cycles. Then, based on Theorem 4.5, a necessary and sufficient condition is that the homomorphism expressivity $\\mathcal F^M$ must contain all homomorphic images of the 8-cycle. Notably, $\\mathcal F^M$ must contain the 4-clique. This will imply that one should at least consider a 3-order GNN (since any 2-order NED cannot form a 4-clique). Interestingly, this justifies the architectures proposed in prior work such as the I$^2$-GNN (Huang et al. 2023) or N$^2$-GNN [3], in that I$^2$-GNN is a 3-order GNN and N$^2$-GNN is a 4-order GNN, both of which can encode 4-cliques as shown in their experiments. Actually, we believe that both I$^2$-GNN and N$^2$-GNN can count 8-cycles.\n\nHuang et al., 2023. Boosting the cycle counting power of graph neural networks with I$^2$-GNNs.\n\nWe hope our response as well as the updated paper can address your concerns. It is really a great pleasure to study these interesting questions you raised, and we are more than willing to delve further into any aspect of the aforementioned response and provide additional details as needed.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer TDGD (Part 3/4)'}, 'comment': {'value': '> **Question 2.** Can the proposed framework also be used to analyze other more general GNN frameworks like [2] or [3]?\n\nYes, our framework can indeed be used to analyze other GNN frameworks and give a precise characterization of their homomorphism expressivity and subgraph counting power. We will take [2] as an example and consider their proposed $k,l$-WL. Since the analysis is similar, we will only show the main result below:\n> **Theorem**: The homomorphism expressivity of $k,l$-WL exists and can be described below:\n>   - $1,l$-WL: $\\mathcal F^{(1,l)}=\\\\\\{F:\\exists U\\subset V_F\\text{ s.t. }|U|\\le l\\text{ and }F\\backslash U\\text{ is a forest}\\\\\\}$;\n>   - $k,l$-WL for $k\\ge 2$: $\\mathcal F^{(k,l)}=\\\\\\{F:\\exists U\\subset V_F\\text{ s.t. }|U|\\le l\\text{ and }\\mathrm{treewidth}(F\\backslash U)\\le k-1\\\\\\}$.\n\nAs can be seen, the above theorem generalizes the homomorphism expressivity of both Subgraph $l$-GNN and $k$-FGNN, which coincides with the fact that $(k,l)$-WL is a general framework that unifies a series of architectures like Subgraph GNN and higher-order GNN.\n\nWe believe the architectures in [3] can be similarly analyzed using our framework (although analyzing them seems to be harder than analyzing $k,l$-GNN). Due to the tight schedule, we may not have enough time to derive a result. Again, we consider the unification of all these prior architectures from the perspective of homomorphic expressivity to be a very exciting research direction for future work.\n\n> **Question 3.** The subgraph counting power is proved for only moderate graph size (nodes size $\\le$ 6 or edge size $\\le 8$). I am wondering, what is the major gap or obstacle for proving a more general graph size? I am guessing it is related to the equation stated in the paper that characterizes the quantitative relationship between homomorphism count and subgraph count. For graphs of general size, is the proposed theorem at least an essential condition for successful counting?\n\nThank you for the question! We are thrilled to announce that we have fully settled this question in recent days. Below, we will demonstrate what is the main obstacle in our previous analysis, and how we resolve it using a new approach.\n\nAs shown in Section 4.2, the subgraph counts of graph $F$ is linearly related to the homomorphism counts of all its homomorphic images. Therefore, if all homomorphic images of $F$ are in $\\mathcal F^M$, then clearly the model $M$ can subgraph-count $F$. This is what Proposition 4.4 states. On the other hand, when exactly one homomorphic image of $F$ is not in $\\mathcal F^M$, it is also clear that the model $M$ cannot subgraph-count $F$ (otherwise, the model will be able to count under homomorphism the homomorphic image by using the linear relation, a contradiction). However, things become complicated when two or more homomorphic images of $F$ are not in $\\mathcal F^M$. We exhaustively verified all moderate-size patterns and found that the result still holds; However, a general proof is challenging as we cannot find universal rules or patterns about which homomorphic image can be used to construct counterexample graphs.\n\nWe resolve this challenge by leveraging a recently proposed technique in the graph theory community (Seppelt, 2023). Intuitively speaking, when the homomorphic images of $F$ contain $N$ non-isomorphic graphs, the method in Seppelt (2023) gave an approach to construct $N$ pairs of counterexample graphs $(G_1, H_1),\\cdots,(G_N, H_N)$ so that $\\mathsf{sub}(F, G_i)=\\mathsf{sub}(F, H_i)\\  \\forall i\\in[N]$ iff $\\mathsf{hom}(F, G_i)=\\mathsf{hom}(F, H_i)\\  \\forall i\\in[N]$. This approach addresses the above difficulty: as long as there is at least one pair of graphs $(G_i, H_i)$ with $\\mathsf{hom}(F, G_i)\\neq\\mathsf{hom}(F, H_i)$, there will be at least one pair of graphs $(G_j, H_j)$ with $\\mathsf{sub}(F, G_j)\\neq\\mathsf{sub}(F, H_j)$. By picking each $(G_i, H_i)$ the Furer graphs expanded by a homomorphic image of $F$, we can obtain the desired result. \n\nSeppelt, 2023.

However, [1] also characterizes other different subgraph GNN variants with different theoretical expressive power (form a strict hierarchy). I am wondering could the proposed framework be used to analyze other variants and reveal the same result as discussed in [1].\n\nThank you for raising this fantastic question! Indeed, our analysis can be easily extended to other architectures in [1] by specifying new variants of NED. Below, we will take the architecture PSWL(VS) as an example. It turns out that its homomorphism expressivity can still be derived in a surprisingly elegant way, by which we are able to recover all theoretical results about PSWL(VS) in [1].\n\nOur results are described based on the latest definition of NED in the updated paper (please see the General Response on why we updated the definition of NED). Moreover, we need to define a concept called *block*:\n- Two ears $P_i, P_j$ are in the same block if one ear is nested on the other with a non-empty nested interval, denoted as $P_i\\sim P_j$;\n- For any ears $P_i,P_j,P_k$, if $P_i\\sim P_j$ and $P_j\\sim P_k$, then $P_i\\sim P_k$.\n\nIt is easy to see that ""block"" is an equivalence relation between ears. We then define several restricted variants of NED as follows:\n- **Strongly endpoint-shared NED**: a NED is called strongly endpoint-shared if all ears with non-empty nested intervals share a common endpoint.\n- **Weakly endpoint-shared NED**: a NED is called weakly endpoint-shared if all ears in the same block share a common endpoint.\n- **Strong NED**: a NED is called strong if for any two children $P_j$, $P_k$ ($j<k$) nested on the same parent ear, we have $I(P_j)\\subset I(P_k)$.\n\nWhile the above concept may be hard to understand at first sight, it can be easily understood via an illustration. In the updated paper, we provide two example graphs that admit weakly endpoint-shared NED (Figure 9(a,b)) and one example graph that does not admit weakly endpoint-shared NED (Figure 9(c)).\n\n> **Theorem**: The homomorphism expressivity of the above three architectures exists and can be described below:\n>   - **Subgraph GNN (SWL(VS)-GNN)**: $\\mathcal F^\\mathsf{Sub}=\\\\\\{F:F\\text{ has a strongly endpoint-shared NED}\\\\\\}$;\n>   - **PSWL(VS)-GNN**: $\\mathcal F^\\mathsf{PSWL}=\\\\\\{F:F\\text{ has a weakly endpoint-shared NED}\\\\\\}$;\n>   - **Local 2-GNN (SSWL-GNN)**: $\\mathcal F^\\mathsf{L}=\\\\\\{F:F\\text{ has a strong NED}\\\\\\}$.\n\nThis readily reveals the expressivity gap among the above three architectures:\n\n> **Corollary**: $\\mathcal F^\\mathsf{Sub}\\subsetneq \\mathcal F^\\mathsf{PSWL}\\subsetneq \\mathcal F^\\mathsf{L}$. Thus, the expressive power of the following three GNN models strictly increases in order: **SWL(VS)**, **PSWL(VS)**, and **SSWL**.\n\n**Proof**: It is clear that any strongly endpoint-shared NED is a weakly endpoint-shared NED and any weakly endpoint-shared NED is a strong NED. To prove strict separation result, observe that:\n- The graph corresponding to Figure 5 in [1] is exactly a counterexample graph that reveals the gap between SWL(VS) and PSWL(VS). It has a weakly endpoint-shared NED but is not strongly endpoint-shared.\n- The graph corresponding to Figure 6 in [1] is exactly a counterexample graph between PSWL(VS) and SSWL. It has a strong NED but is not weakly endpoint-shared.\n\nMoreover, as a significant implication, we have the following result:\n> **Corollary**: PSWL(VS) cannot count 6 cycles at node-level.\n\n**Proof**: in our paper, the bottom-right graph in Figure 4(b) is a homomorphic image of the rooted 6-cycle, which, unfortunately, does not have a weakly endpoint-shared NED if the root vertex is an endpoint of the first ear. Therefore, PSWL(VS) cannot count 6 cycles at node-level. \n\nWe believe other architectures in [1] can be similarly analyzed using our framework in an elegant way. Due to the tight schedule, we cannot present all results, but we believe it is an exciting research direction to unify all these prior architectures using the perspective of homomorphism expressivity.

Below, we would like to address each of your questions and concerns:\n\n> **Question.** Is the connectedness assumption in Definition 3.1 necessary?\n\nThanks for raising this great technical question. Actually, the connectedness assumption in Definition 3.1 is not necessary, but it can greatly simplify the presentation of our theoretical results. We choose to add this assumption due to the following considerations:\n- Let $F$ be a disconnected graph that can be decomposed into several connected components $F_1,\\cdots, F_m$. Then, for any graph $G$, we have $\\mathsf{hom}(F,G)=\\mathsf{hom}(F_1,G)\\times \\cdots \\times \\mathsf{hom}(F_m,G)$. It is straightforward to prove that $F\\in\\mathcal F^M$ iff $F_i\\in\\mathcal F^M$ for all $i\\in[m]$. Consequently, there is no need to consider disconnected graphs.\n- For node/edge-level expressivity, things will become a bit complicated. Consider a disconnected rooted graph $F^u$ that can be decomposed into several connected components $F_1^u, F_2, \\cdots, F_m$ where the root node is in $F_1$. Then, for any graph $G^v$, we have $\\mathsf{hom}(F^u,G^v)=\\mathsf{hom}(F_1^u,G^v)\\times \\mathsf{hom}(F_2,G)\\times \\cdots \\times \\mathsf{hom}(F_m,G)$. Analogously, it can be proved that $F^u\\in\\mathcal F_\\mathsf{n}^M$ iff $F_1^u\\in\\mathcal F_\\mathsf{n}^M$ and $F_i\\in\\mathcal F^M$ for all $i\\in\\\\\\{2.\\cdots,m\\\\\\}$. Again, there is no need to consider disconnected graphs.\n- The inclusion of disconnected graphs will complicate the definition of NED. In the original Definition 3.2, any ear $P_i$ ($i>1$) is nested on some previous ear, and the relationship between different ears forms a *tree* structure. When extending to disconnected graphs, Definition 3.2 should be modified wherein the relationship between different ears now forms a *forest* (i.e., there can be more than one ears not nested on any ear). \n\n> **Weakness.** The presentation is quite dense.

Here, the inclusion of Section 3.3 (node/edge-level expressivity) is primarily motivated by its foundational role in Sections 4.2 (node/edge-level subgraph counting) and 4.3 (polynomial expressivity), where we have addressed pivotal open questions from previous research. However, we acknowledge the need for expanded exposition in other sections to enhance accessibility. We will definitely expand on other parts once our paper is accepted so that more space is allowed.\n\n> **Weakness.** The experimental study on real-world datasets is quite limited. It would be nice to see a more refined analysis, e.g., analyzing subgraph occurrences and see if an architecture's performance is correlated to its ability to count different subgraphs.\n\nThanks for the suggestion. To further comprehend our experimental study, we have performed two additional tasks. First, we extended our experiments on real-world datasets to include the ZINC-full benchmark, which comprises 250K molecular graphs, a substantial increase in size compared to the ZINC-subset. The results have been presented in the updated paper. As before, all models obey the same computational budget of 500K parameters. Again, the correlation between model performance and homomorphism expressivity remains evident, with Local 2-FGNN exhibiting superior performance across all three real datasets.\n\nNext, we conduct experiments on real-world tasks to see if an architecture's performance is correlated to its ability to count different subgraphs. For the molecular property prediction task, it is well-known that the ability to count 6-cycles is crucial as 6-cycles cover important structures like benzene rings. We thus investigate whether different GNN models can count 6 cycles *on the ZINC dataset*. By examining the dataset, we found that the number of 6-cycles in most molecules ranges from 1 to 3. We then trained different models and report the MAE results in the following table. Here, we ran each experiment 10 times independently with different seeds and report the average performance as well as the standard deviation.\n| Model    | MAE |\n| -------- | ------- |\n| MPNN         | 1.357 Â± 0.007 |\n| Subgraph GNN | 0.030 Â± 0.001 |\n| Local 2-GNN  | 0.021 Â± 0.001 |\n| Local 2-FGNN | 0.021 Â± 0.001 |\n\nOne can see that MPNN and Subgraph GNN perform much worse than Local 2-(F)GNN in counting 6-cycles, indicating that they cannot effectively encode the information of benzene rings on ZINC dataset.

It\'s worth noting that both Subgraph $(k-1)$-GNN and Local $k$-GNN exhibit a worst-case time complexity of $O(n^{k-1}m)$ for a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The limitation in counting large cliques arises because the $k$âclique detection problem requires at least $n^{\\Omega(k)}$ time [1].\n\nWhile counting cliques is intrinsically difficult, most models in this paper are still quite powerful in expressing subgraph counts for sparser graphs. For instance, as demonstrated in Table 5 of our paper, Subgraph GNN, Local 2-GNN, Local 2-FGNN, and 2-FGNN can express subgraph counts for all graphs within 5 edges.\n\n[1] Chen et al. Tight lower bounds for certain parameterized np-hard problems.\n\n> How do you compare your method for counting with the other methods, like equivariant polynomials for GNNs and RNP-GNNs?\n\nHomomorphism is closely connected to equivariant polynomials, and as elucidated in Section 4.3 and Appendix H, our findings offer valuable insights into polynomial expressivity across practical GNN architectures and answer an open problem in Puny et al. (2023). It is noteworthy that homomorphism expressivity is *complete*: $(\\mathrm{i})$ whenever a model $M_1$ is more expressive than another model $M_2$ in **certain** aspect, homomorphism can capture it via $\\mathcal F^{M_1}\\backslash\\mathcal F^{M_2}$. Conversely, $\\mathcal F^{M_2}\\subset\\mathcal F^{M_1}$ will imply that model $M_1$ is more expressive than model $M_2$ in **any** aspect. However, it is not known whether this crucial property holds for polynomial expressivity.\n\nRegarding RNP-GNNs, understanding their homomorphism expressivity seems to be challenging. Indeed, RNP-GNNs with parameters $(r_1,\\cdots,r_\\tau)$ can be treated as a sparse version of $\\tau$-order GNNs. Consequently, to characterize their homomorphism expressivity, a novel form of $\\tau$-order ear must be identified, along with a specification detailing how different ears can nest upon each other. However, analyzing higher-order NED is quite challenging as shown in Appendix E. We only have some intuitions that the recursion may correspond to a ""split"" operation in a higher-order ear, which increases the number of paths by one (see Definition E.1). Nevertheless, we believe that there must exist a proper definition of NED that can precisely characterize the homomorphism expressivity of RNP-GNNs, and once the NED is found, the subgraph counting power of RNP-GNNs can be entirely characterized by using Theorem 4.5. We leave it as an interesting topic for future work.\n\n---\n\n**Importance of homomorphism numbers**. We argue that homomorphism expressivity is a practical expressivity measure because $\\mathcal F^M$ fully characterizes the subgraph counting power of GNN model $M$ as shown in Theorem 4.5 (please see the General Response for our new results). We use homomorphism count instead of subgraph count due to two main reasons:\n\n- The homomorphism expressivity $\\mathcal F^M$ contains all information of the subgraph counting power, but the converse does not hold: even if the subgraph counting power of model $M$ is fully characterized, $\\mathcal F^M$ is still not determined. In other words, homomorphism expressivity is a **complete** expressivity measure and contains more information than the incomplete measure of subgraph counting.\n- There exist elegant descriptions of the homomorphism expressivity for a wide range of models (e.g., using trees or certain types of NED). However, characterizing the subgraph counting power of popular GNN models is hard without resorting to homomorphism expressivity (see Arvind et al. (2020)). This possibly implies that homomorphism counting is more **fundamental** than subgraph counting. Indeed, subgraph is essentially a restricted form of homomorphism, namely, *injective homomorphism*.\n\nWe hope our response as well as the updated paper can address your concerns. We are more than willing to delve further into any aspect of the aforementioned response and provide additional details as needed, and we look forward to your reply.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer aNaP (Part 1/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We sincerely thank Reviewer aNaP for the detailed review and positive feedback. Below, we would like to address each of your concerns and suggestions:\n\n**Examples of different kinds of substructures in Theorem 3.3**. Thanks for the suggestion. We are sorry that owing to the space limit, in the initial submission we only give one example for each type of NED in the main text but have provided a comprehensive collection of examples in the Appendix (see Table 6). Based on Theorem 3, Table 6 lists all substructures within a moderate size and identifies whether each substructure belongs to each type of NED. We believe Table 6 is comprehensive enough to cover most substructures of interest in the GNN community. During the discussion period, we further add several representative examples in Figure 9. Additionally, in Table 4 we have presented the graph statistics, facilitating a quantitative comparison between different kinds of substructures. For example, among all 112 non-isomorphic graphs of 6 vertices:\n- 6 graphs are trees;\n- 51 graphs admit endpoint-shared NEDs;\n- 55 graphs admit strong NEDs;\n- 56 graphs admit almost-strong NEDs;\n- 56 graphs admit general NEDs.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'General Response: New results & Paper Updates'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We sincerely thank all the reviewers and the area chair for their great efforts in reviewing our paper. We would like to take this opportunity to highlight that, during the discussion period, we have significantly enhanced two key theoretical results originally presented in the initial submission, which we believe can further strengthen this work.\n\n**Necessary and sufficient condition of subgraph counting**. In the initial submission, we prove that for all moderate-size graphs $F$ (i.e., $\\le$ 6 vertices or $\\le$ 8 edges), a model $M$ can subgraph-count $F$ iff $\\mathsf{Spasm}(F)\\subset \\mathcal F^M$. We have now successfully extended the result to **all graphs** (see Theorem 4.5 in the updated paper). We are thus excited to see that homomorphism expressivity can **completely** characterize the subgraph counting power of different models! \n\n**Improved description of homomorphism expressivity.** In the initial submission, the homomorphism expressivity of a GNN model $M$ is typically described in the following way: $\\mathcal F^M=\\mathsf{Clo}_\\mathsf{ind}(\\\\\\{F: F \\text{ has a certain type of NED} \\\\\\})$.\n\n A potential drawback of such a description is that it is still not easy to check whether a graph $F\\notin F^M$ due to the presence of $\\mathsf{Clo}_\\mathsf{ind}$, since one needs to prove that for infinitely many $G$ where $F$ is an induced subgraph of $G$, $G$ does not have a certain type of NED.\n\nThis issue inspires us to think about whether it is possible to remove $\\mathsf{Clo}_\\mathsf{ind}$. We have recently succeeded in achieving this goal and obtained a cleaner description. The crux here is to slightly relax the definition of NED. In the previous definition, an ear $P_i$ is nested on another ear $P_j$ if *both* endpoints of $P_i$ lie in $P_j$; We now relax the definition that allows the situation where only one endpoint of $P_i$ lies in $P_j$ and the other endpoint is not in any previous ear. We note that this modification yields a novel extension of NED that does not appear in prior work. Under the new definition, we successfully proved the following results:\n\n> **Theorem**: The homomorphism expressivity of the following architectures exists and can be described below:\n>   - **Subgraph GNN**: $\\mathcal F^\\mathsf{Sub}=\\\\\\{F:F\\text{ has an endpoint-shared NED}\\\\\\}$;\n>   - **Local 2-GNN**: $\\mathcal F^\\mathsf{L}=\\\\\\{F:F\\text{ has a strong NED}\\\\\\}$.\n>   - **Local 2-FGNN**: $\\mathcal F^\\mathsf{LF}=\\\\\\{F:F\\text{ has an almost-strong NED}\\\\\\}$.\n>   - **2-FGNN**: $\\mathcal F^\\mathsf{F}=\\\\\\{F:F\\text{ has a NED}\\\\\\}$.\n\nOne can see that the updated theorem is much simpler and more elegant than the previous one.\n\n---\n\n**Paper updates.** Below, we highlight the major updates of the revised submission. \n- **Definition 3.2 and Theorems 3.3, 3.6, and 3.8.** The definition of NED has been subtly adjusted, and $\\mathsf{Clo}_\\mathsf{ind}$ has been removed in these theorems.\n- **Theorem 4.5.** The condition restricting graphs to moderate-sizes has been removed.

There seems to be a technical issue with the definition of homomorphism expressivity (Definition 3.1). I believe it can be solved, but requires addressing or further clarification. Specifically, $\\mathcal{F}^M$ is not necessarily defined for all models $M$ since it does not take into account graphs $F$ for which there exist graphs $G$ and $H$ with equal homomorphism counts with respect to $F$ but different representations according to $M$. Homomorphism expressivity of $M$ is defined only if no such $F$ exists since it cannot be within $\\mathcal{F}^M$ and also cannot be outside $\\mathcal{F}^M$. For example, homomorphism expressivity is not defined for a universal architecture as it can assign different representations to any two non-isomorphic graphs.\n    1. Is it the case that for the GNNs considered $\\mathcal{F}^M$ is always well-defined? This seems to be indicated by Theorem 3.3 and the subsequent discussion, however, it is not clear enough. I strongly recommend elaborating upon this point near the definition to avoid confusion.\n\n    2. Homomorphism expressivity is referred throughout as a âcompleteâ measure. Given that it is not defined for all architectures $M$, I believe this terminology can be misleading.\n\n2. Homomorphism expressivity suffers from a limitation that also exists in the WL framework: it disregards features of vertices/edges. The proposed expressivity measure takes into account only the ability to capture graph structures, assuming each vertex is associated with a unique discrete label. While identifying graph structure is indeed important, in many cases the features of vertices play an equal, if not more important role (see, e.g., [1]). I do not believe this significantly harms the quality of the current paper, and is perhaps a consideration for future work, but to me referring to homomorphism expressivity as a âcompleteâ measure may require some hedging.\n\n[1] Liu, Renming, et al.

We are not sure about what you mean by âfull quantized fine-tuningâ. If it means quantization-aware full fine-tuning, our method is orthogonal to this setting because quantization-aware full fine-tuning does not have low-rank adapters. However, in terms of the initialization of the quantization-aware full fine-tuning, which also starts with a quantized model, our method could provide valuable insight: simply add the $A_T B_T$ back to $Q_T$, but how to add it back so that it achieves the least quantization discrepancy still remains an open question.'}}, {'comment': {'value': '**Response to your questions**\n1. Thanks for the advice of taking experiments on regularized FP LoRA. The FP LoRA in our paper is fine-tuned without any regularization but we have properly tuned the hyper-parameters, including lora_alpha, learning rate, batch size, etc. We did observe overfitting: as the training epoch increases, the accuracy on the test set drops after a certain epoch. We use early stopping to prevent overfitting. We stop the training by the 6th epoch. \n\n2. Adding weight decay to the LoRA adapters does help the LLAMA-2-13b on GSM8K, but it does not help LLAMA-2-7b on GSM8K. Specifically, full precision LLAMA-2-13b with LoRA achieves 46.0% now, instead of 43%, but LLAMA-2-7b drops from 36.9% to 34.4% on GSM8K. We will add the regularization results to the latest paper.\nWe have listed the required epochs in Table 11 and Table 12 in the Appendix. We choose the same epochs for both FP LoRA and LoftQ in all experiments.\nThank you for your insightful comments. Allow me to address a potential misunderstanding regarding the motivation of LoRA and quantization. The original motivation of LoRA is efficient multi-task learning as introduced in the second paragraph of Section 1 in LoRA paper. The motivation of weights-only quantization is model compression, allowing LLMs to run on memory-limited devices.\n\n3. To the best of our knowledge and the NLP literature, it is not clear whether quantization-aware training (QAT) would be an upper bound for LoftQ or QLoRA, given two reasons: (1) the initial weights are quantized and therefore there exists a significant gap between quantized initialization and the pre-trained weights in QAT, while LoftQ can reduce such a gap. (2) it is difficult to update the non-continuous quantized parameters, which is merely possible to achieve full precision fine-tuning performance, let alone given severely degraded initial weights. On the other hand, LoftQ fine-tunes full precision LoRA adapters, making it easy to fine-tune.\nThe LoRA adapters, A and B, are not quantized. They remain full precision throughout the training. Maintaining full precision or for the LoRA adapters cause minor extra memory compared to quantized LoRA adapters.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Attention to a closely related work'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Dear authors, \n\nI enjoy reading this paper, since it is well-motivated, well-written, and offers strong results.

On the calculation of the densities:**\n\nThis is a great question. For the translation invariance, though the community usually refers to the distribution/likelihood as the translation invariant[1,2,3], it is important to distinguish it from the rotation invariant. The rotational invariant is defined as $p(x)=p(\\mathbf{R}x)$, while the translational is **not** as $p(x)=p(x+t)$ as such distribution can not integrate into one and hence does not exist.  \n\nFortunately, the freedom of translation could be eliminated by only focusing on learning distribution on the linear subspace where the center of gravity is always zero. This is, for all configurations on $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 3}$ space,  the density on the zero CoM space is utilized to **represent** their density[1,2];  It\'s important to note that the distribution is not defined for configurations outside the zero CoM space. However, it remains possible to leverage the distribution to provide a density-evaluation **(not probability density)** on the configurations outside the zero CoM space.  This is achieved by projecting them back into the subspace.\n\nThe reviewer mentioned an alternative method to remove the freedom of translation by integrating the density over configurations that only differ by CoM across the entirety of the $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 3}$ space. However, this method could be intractable due to two main reasons.  Firstly, the continuous space of translation transformation for integration could be challenging. Secondly, if the density has a defined scope encompassing all the $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 3}$ configurations, the density would necessarily be impacted by the translation (can not be translational invariant) which is also undesirable. \n\nThe evaluation procedure for configurations out of zero CoM space could only get a quantity defined artificially instead of the true density of some real distribution, e.g. it is referred to as ""CoM-free density"" in [1]. Thus,  there does not exist correctness issues. We understand that this part could easily lead to confusion. Therefore, we added more explanations as suggested to help clarify any misunderstandings.\n\n**Q2. The definition of $p_\\phi(x|\\theta_n^{x})$:**\n\nSorry for causing the confusion. For the $p_\\phi(\\mathbf{x}|\\theta_n)$, it is actually $\np_O\\left(\\mathbf{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_n, \\phi \\right) \n$ as mentioned in  Page 3 after Eq. 6 in our paper.  We added the definition in Eq. 8 as suggested to eliminate the confusion. \n\n**Q3. How does your alternative presentation differ from the VAE perspective in the BFN paper [4], eqns (17-20)?**\n\nOur alternative graphical-model presentation mainly reveals the dependency between the variable $\\boldsymbol {\\theta}$ and the variable $\\boldsymbol {y}$ and also helps to provide a clear comparison with diffusion models in Fig. 2. The VAE perspective in BFN paper [4], eqn3(17-20), shows the latent variable model formulation with only $\\boldsymbol {y}$ as the latent variable while the network actually takes $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ as the input and output.  The proposed graphical presentation helps to figure out the Markov property on the $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ (while $\\boldsymbol{y}$ is non-Markov), which is essential for understanding and proving the SE(3) invariant property of our model(GeoBFN).  We will carefully check the presentation as suggested to avoid overclaiming the contribution. \n\nIf there is any further information you may need, please feel free to let us know! \n\n---\n[1] Minkai Xu, Lantao Yu, Yang Song, Chence Shi, Stefano Ermon, and Jian Tang. 2021. âGeoDiff: A Geometric Diffusion Model for Molecular Conformation Generation,â\n\n[2] Emiel Hoogeboom, Victor Garcia Satorras, Clement Vignac, Max Welling 2022 ""Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D""\n\n[3]  KÃ¶hler, Jonas, Leon Klein, and Frank NoÃ©. 2020. âEquivariant Flows: Exact Likelihood Generative Learning for Symmetric Densities.â'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Follow-up questions'}, 'comment': {'value': ""I thank the authors for their response, revisions, and clarifications.

The reason why larger numbers of generation steps seem to decrease the novelty of the molecules**\n\nThis is a great question! Note that by increasing the discretization steps, the sampled distribution will approach the distribution implied by the fully continuous objective in Eq. (19). The novelty is defined as the proportion of generated samples that are unique and unseen in the training dataset. This reveals the consistency of model distribution in Eq. (19) and data distribution.\n\nBesides, the decrease in novelty could also raise a concern about an overfitting phenomenon. And we clarify the concerns in the following. As demonstrated in previous works [2,3], the concept of novelty must be examined alongside validity, uniqueness, and stability rates to get a comprehensive evaluation of the generative model. For a fair comparison with other models, e.g. EDM and GeoLDM, which use 1k steps to sample, we consider the performance of GeoBFN under the 1k steps. We could find that our method indeed demonstrates higher novelty compared to others. With the superior performance on the molecule quality metrics (stability, etc), our method also holds a higher novelty. This demonstrates that our proposed method shows better generalization ability and could better explore the molecule space instead of overfitting. \n\n**Q4. Relationship between atom stability and molecule stability**\n\nYes, as the reviewer noticed, with fewer generation steps, the atom stability does not decrease obviously. Note that atom stability is defined as the proportion of atoms having the right valency, and molecular stability is defined as the proportion of generated molecules for which all atoms are stable [2]. Hence, molecule stability could be approximately seen as the $M$-th exponential to the atom stability where $M$ is the number of atom nodes.\n\n**Q5. Is it clear why the validity of the DRUG database samples seems to decrease with the number of generation steps, and is overall lower than some of the baselines? Is there something special about this dataset?**\n\nWe borrow the discussion towards validity and stability in [2]. ""Note that the validity is evaluated using RDkit. The molecule is built to contain only heavy atoms and RDKit will add hydrogens to each heavy atoms in such a way that the valency of each atom matches its atom type. Hence invalid molecules mostly appear when an atom has a valency bigger than expected. Experimentally,  it is observed that validity could artificially be increased by reducing the number of bonds. For example, predicting only single bonds was enough to obtain close to 100% of valid molecules on GEOM-DRUGS. On the contrary, the stability metrics directly model hydrogens and cannot be tricked as easily.""\nAs the reviewer noticed, the validity decreased with the number of generation steps and was even lower than some baselines on GEOM. This could reflect some intrinsic properties of GeoBFN. We hypothesize that the GeoBFN would tend to generate molecules with a more compact structure (as the generation variance is lower) and hence could get bigger valencies for atoms especially when the atom number is large. However, it is worth noticing that on the stability metrics which could not be tricked easily, GeoBFN still shows superior performance. \n\n-----\n[1] CRC Handbook.  2007.

We address all your concerns in the following.  \n\n**Q1. The noise-sensitivity section (3.3) is not very clear, the authors should describe in more detail the issue and why a variance-increasing versus variance-decreasing sampling procedure is an important design decision. The claim of ""smoother information changes"" especially seems intuitive yet subjective.**\n   \nSorry for causing the confusion.  Section 3.3 has been rewritten as suggested.\n\n- **Further clarification on noise sensitivity:**\n\nThe property of noise sensitivity seeks to state the fact: When noise is incorporated into the coordinates and displaces them significantly from their original positions, the bond distance between certain connected atoms may exceed the bond length range[1]. Under these circumstances, the point cloud could potentially lose the critical chemical information inherently encoded in the bonded structures; Another perspective stems from the reality that when noise is added to the coordinates, the relationships (distance) between different atoms could alter at a more rapid pace, e.g. modifying the coordinates of one atom results in altering its distance to all other atoms.\n\n- **Towards the ""smoother information changes"" and  design decision:**\n\nWe agree that such a claim could be subjective as the reviewer says and we have rephrased the presentation in the updated version to eliminate the misunderstanding. The opinion of ""smoother information changes"" is borrowed from the original BFN paper [2], which describes the generation process in the parameter space as regularized with the Bayesian update procedure. This is, noisier samples will be assigned with a smaller weight during the update (Eq. 11). Our objective here is to describe that during the diffusion process for generation, the intermediate steps\' structure might be uninformative, with the majority of the information being acquired in the final few steps of generation (as depicted in Figure 3); On the other hand, as shown in Figure 3, the structure of the intermediate steps gradually converges to the final structure, suggesting a smoother increase in information. The key intuition is our belief that gradual changes could potentially provide a beneficial inductive bias for generation procedure design decisions as in [2]. The ""entropy-increasing"" and ""entropy-decreasing""  are removed for a more strict and objective presentation. \n\n**Q2. The authors should explain how the objective is changing in equation 21, as it is not clear to me how this is improving the issue with the sparser sampling of the center buckets.**\n\nWe apologize for any confusion caused. The original sampling process for the discretised variable of the BFN, as detailed in [2], is depicted in Algorithm 6. Here, the variable $k$ is sampled using the formula\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{k} \\sim \\text{DISCRETISED\\\\_OUTPUT\\\\_DISTRIBUTION}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, t, 1-\\sigma_1^{2 t}\\right) = \n\\text{DISCRETISED\\\\_CDF}\\left(\\mu_x^{(d)}, \\sigma_x^{(d)}, k_r\\right) - \\text{DISCRETISED\\\\_CDF}\\left(\\mu_x^{(d)}, \\sigma_x^{(d)}, k_l\\right)$$\n\n\nIn this equation, $\\text{DISCRETISED\\\\_OUTPUT\\\\_DISTRIBUTION}$ denotes the probability of each bin and the sampling procedure essentially involves drawing a sample from a categorical distribution defined by $\\text{DISCRETISED\\\\_OUTPUT\\\\_DISTRIBUTION}$. \n\nFor instance, if the $\\text{DISCRETISED\\\\_OUTPUT\\\\_DISTRIBUTION}$ is supported on {0,1,2} with corresponding probabilities {0.5,0,0.5}, the original sampling method would only draw from either {0} or {2}. However, in Eq. 21, we first compute the weighted average, which turns out to be $0.5\\*0 + 0\\*1 + 0.5\\*2 = 1$, and subsequently select the nearest neighbor in the support set, which also yields the value $1$.

The architectural / data preprocessing differences to EDM and the attribution of the improvements of GeoBFN.**\n\nIn our experiment, we ensured all components such as network architecture, data preprocessing, and evaluation pipeline were consistent with the settings in EDM to maintain fair comparisons.\nThe performance enhancements were primarily due to the new training objective and sampling algorithm. As evident in Table 3\'s ablation studies, the performance was also improved with an optimized version of sampling.\nThe training loss in Equation (19), as the reviewer mentioned, is similar to the diffusion objective. The distinguishing factors between BFNs and Diffusion models mainly lie in their differing modeling space and graphic models, as portrayed in Figure 2. The parameter space has the favorable characteristic of low variance, and the sampling process varies significantly from the diffusion model. In the latter, the final sample is forecasted and incorporated through a Bayesian update.  The joint modality modeling and previous properties could primarily contribute to the improved performance.\n\n**Q5. Clear formulation of the training algorithm.**\n\nThanks for the suggestion.

Clarification of the last paragraph of Section 3.3.**\n- **Towards the ""entropy"" increase or ""entropy"" decrease:**\n\nSorry for making the presentation unclear. After carefully checking the presentation in the mentioned sentence, the term ""entropy"" needs to be further clarified as the reviewer mentioned. Here we tend to distinguish the information changes between the BFNs and diffusion models. Entropy could be used as a good metric to analyze. For strict presentation, we need to limit the scoop of discussion on quantized space to guarantee the entropy is non-negative, e.g. images with a pixel value in {0,1,...,255}, instead of a continuous variable to avoid the discussion on differentiable entropy. In such cases, the entropy could be interpreted as the bits needed to describe/compress the distribution. Thus, in diffusion models, the sampling starts from a normal distribution, and with iterative refinement, the distribution approaches the data distribution which certainly has less entropy than the initial distribution(""entropy"" decrease); While in Bayesian Flow networks, the starting point of all sampling procedure is the same constant $\\theta_0 = \\textbf{0}$ where the entropy is zero. Here the sampled distribution will have entropy larger than the initial state(""entropy"" increase). The mentioned part is revised and the mentioned inaccurate parts are removed as suggested in the updated version to make it clear. \n\nEssentially, we would like to provide insight by distinguishing the source of randomness of the two different models. In the diffusion model, with recent advancements such as probability flow ode [3], the randomness of the system could be seen as obtained from the initial prior distribution. While in BFN, the randomness of the system is added gradually at each step by conducting a Bayesian update with the noisy variable.\n\n- **To the question of why the variable $\\theta$ has lower entropy (variance):**\n\nAs we only claim the modeling on the $\\theta$ space enjoys lower ""variance"", we suppose the reviewer is concerned about the low-variance property. We take the modeling procedure of BFN on the continuous variable as an example. And yes, as the reviewer mentioned, $\\theta$ is indeed obtained from $y$ which is the noisy variable. Recall the Bayesian update function in Eq. (11), i.e. $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\_i = \\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\_{i-1} \\rho_{i-1}+\\mathbf{y} \\alpha}{\\rho_i}$. The variance of $y$ is $\\alpha^{-1}$ as defined in Eq. (10). Therefore, for $y$ with large variance, the $\\alpha$ is small and hence contributes less to update $\\theta$. In other words, the update of $\\theta$ is dominated by those $y$ with small variance. Such a property of Bayesian update helps get a lower variance on $\\theta$ compared to $y$. A visualizational analysis can be found in Figure 5 of [4].

Our usage of the notation $L_{\\infty}$ directly follows the notation in [1], which describes the objective function with an infinite number of continuous time steps. On the other hand, Equation (8) pertains to the objective function with a finite number of discrete time steps.

We added the reference as suggested to enhance the comprehensiveness of our paper. \n\n- **The correctness of the optimization objective $L_{\\infty}$**\n\nAs shown in the above discussion, the optimization objective $L_{\\infty}$ can be viewed as an extension of the variational lower bound of the log-likelihood function to the case of infinite continuous time steps. Therefore, optimizing this objective essentially means maximizing the variational lower bounds of the log-likelihood function. Although there is a slight bias towards the maximum likelihood objective, such objectives are widely applied in training generative models, such as VAEs [1] and Diffusion Models [2].

The details of the Conditional Molecule Generation experiment.**\n\nThanks for bringing this to our attention. The generation of conditional molecules is directly performed after conducting conditional experiments in our previous work [5,6]. During conditional training, we utilize the interdependency modeling network $\\phi$ in Eq.(19), which takes the property $c$ as an additional input, i.e., $\\Phi(\\theta,t,c)$. \n\nIn the process of generating molecules conditionally, we first sample the property $c$ and the node number $M$ from a prior distribution $p(c,M)$ that is defined in [5]. The distribution $p(c,M)$ is computed on the training partition and is parameterized as a two-dimensional categorical distribution. The continuous variable $c$ is discretized into small, uniformly distributed intervals. \n\nFor a more comprehensive explanation, please refer to the updated information in the Appendix D.\n\n**Q5. Discussion on sampling the charges via the discretized method outperforms sampling as discrete atom types.**\n\nThis is a great question! Firstly, our main motivation for using charges for sampling is that we only need to model and sample on two similar modalities: discretized data type and continuous data type. This approach reduces the redundancy of information between the charges and types compared to previous literature [5, 6], which utilized all three modalities for modeling.\n\nFurthermore, the discretized charges allow for a more granular perspective of the distinctively varied electrostatic environment around different atoms. This introduces a more informed sampling framework that better integrates the chemical properties and reactivity.\n\nAdditionally, as the reviewer mentioned, the atomic charge may not present a clear continuum, and there are nuances that justify the use of discretization. We fully agree with the reviewer\'s proposition that distinguishing between hydrogen and non-hydrogen atoms could be another important way to better understand the benefits of our proposed sampling method. Hydrogen is unique in terms of its proton count and chemical behavior, and while a categorical approach can differentiate between hydrogen and other atoms, a discretized approach can leverage this distinction even further. This could inspire a fruitful feature direction for further exploration.\n\n**Q6.

We address your concerns in the following:\n\n **Q1. The translational equivariance of theorem 3.1.**\n\nThank you for bringing this up, and we apologize for any confusion caused. The term ""Zero of Mass"" actually refers to a slightly abused concept of ""Center-of-Mass Free"" as discussed in Section 5 of [1], as well as ""Zero Center of Mass"" mentioned in [2]. We will now provide a thorough analysis of the translation invariance in Theorem 3.1, which is outlined below.\nThe term SE(3)-invariant density is a concept that has been derived from previous research [2]. However, the notion of a ""translational-invariant density"" requires further clarification. In the normal Euclidean space, there is no distribution that can be truly translation-invariant, meaning that $p_X(x) = p_X(x+t)$  for all t, where t represents the translation vector. This condition implies that the probability density function is a constant function, which can not integrate into one [3]. \n\nIn existing literature, the term ""translational-invariant property"" actually refers to two key ideas. \n1.  Firstly, it suggests that we can avoid modeling the freedom of translation of the geometries by learning a probability distribution only on the subspace where the center of mass is zero. \n2. Secondly, it implies that it is possible to construct a function $f$ that can evaluate the density for samples in the original sample space, including samples with the center of mass is not zero.\n\nIntuitively, this function $f$ maps the samples to the zero center of mass space and returns the density of probability defined on that space. It is important to note that this function f does not correspond to the probability density function of any real distribution and is often referred to as the ""CoM-free standard density"" as described in [2]. Achieving translational invariance can be easily accomplished by constraining the sample space of the generative model to lie in the zero center of mass space. This can be achieved by moving the center of mass to zero for the generated samples, denoted as $x$ in our context.\n\nIn Theorem 3.1, we have regularized all the parameters $\\theta$, $y$, and $x$ to be centered around zero. Although this condition is sufficient to achieve translation invariance, it is not necessary as mentioned earlier. Specifically, regularizing the output of $\\phi_x$ in the zero Center of Mass space should be sufficient to obtain this property. To ensure stable training, we also center all $\\theta$ and $y$ around zero in the Center of Mass space.\n\nFor more detailed and formal proof, as well as further discussion, please refer to Appendix C.1 of the updated version.\n\n**Q2.

This paper was based on a ""communication"" perspective that could often prove challenging to grasp and apply in other fields. The summarization could act as a beneficial resource aiding the comprehension of the complex properties and further exploration of this sophisticated generative model.\n- Another significant aspect is the demonstration of BFN compatibility with SE(3) invariant density modeling tasks, which is substantiated by the proof of Theorem 3.1. This realization is non-trivial given the fundamental differences between BNF and previous diffusion models.\n\n**Q3. The inconsistency of Eq. (5) in our paper and  Eq. (6) in [4]:**\n\nThank you for pointing it out, and we apologize for any confusion caused. In our paper, we use Eq. (5) to describe the components of the generative process or the generative model. On the other hand, in [4], Eq. (6) is employed to formalize the training objective.\n\nIn Eq. (5), the $p_O(y_i|\\theta_{i-1};\\alpha_i)$ should be changed to the so-called receiver distribution in [4], i.e.,  \n$p_R (y_i|\\theta_{i-1};\\alpha_i) = \\underset{p_O\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime} \\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{i-1}; \\phi \\right)}{\\mathbb{E}} p_S\\left(\\mathbf{y} \\mid \\mathbf{x}^{\\prime} ; \\alpha_i\\right)$. \n\nThe typos have been fixed as suggested in the updated version.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'Bayesian Flow Networks (BFN) are a recently proposed generative model, which uses diffusion in the inference process (like diffusion models), but for the generative process maintains a latent distribution parameters over the data, and updates these with Bayesian updates.

Additionally, teleporting to minima with different curvatures improves generalization, which suggests a connection between the curvature of the minimum and generalization ability.

The time required to teleport a pair of layers scales quadratically with the hidden layer width and linearly with the mini-batch size. For large models, one can teleport a subset of all weights without affecting the others, as individual teleportation can be performed on each pair of consecutive layers. Since the time complexity of teleporting a pair of layers does not depend on the depth, it is feasible to carry out teleportation in deep networks.\n\n> â2. Is it possible to show that teleportation achieves better generalization bounds using tools like algorithm stability [2]? The current results are encouraging but a bit lack of rigourous theoretical proof.â\n\nThanks for pointing us to a relevant approach for developing a generalization bound. The generalization bounds in [2] build on the theorem that uniform stability implies generalization in expectation, and that stochastic gradient methods are $\\epsilon$-uniformly stable. One approach to show that teleportation achieves better generalization bounds is to prove that SGD with a teleportation that improves curvature is $\\epsilon_1$-uniformly stable with $\\epsilon_1 < \\epsilon$, which leads to a tighter generalization bound. However, establishing such a proof appears to be challenging, since it is not clear how teleportation affects uniform stability.  \n\nOur main contribution in Section 4 is developing a new approximation method for the curvature of the minimum, and effect of teleporting for sharpness/curvature on generalization. Finding a complete theory is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we have included some theoretical investigations on the correlation between curvature and generalization. We believe that Appendix F.2 could serve as a starting point to develop a generalization bound for teleportation. The expected displacement of minimum under distribution shift is directly related to the curvature of the minimum and provides a way to quantify the generalization gap. \n\n**References**\n\n[1] Zhao, B., Dehmamy, N., Walters, R., & Yu, R.

Moreover, the extension to SGD is done not based on standard noise assumption.\n\nWe respectfully disagree this is an incremental contribution in theory. Theorem 3.1 is the first global convergence theory that allows for teleportation. It was not trivial to identify that such a proof is possible, nor was it trivial to establish. We have also never seen a proof that guarantees that all points on the orbit converge before. There were three main technical challenges/innovations that set this theorem apart from a standard SGD theorem 1) finding the right proof structure and assumptions, 2) introducing a weighted telescoping, and  3) controlling an exponential terms with a cyclic dependency. Below we detail these three challenges. \n1) Before proving Theorems 3.1, we first had to find a proof structure and assumptions that could work with teleportation. Standard proofs based on convexity, or strong convexity, were not amenable to a teleportation step. The reason being that the teleportation step can move far away from the current iterate, which in turn breaks the recurrence relations required by these proofs. We found that only non-convex type proofs could allow for teleportation.\n\n2) After determining a smoothness type proof could work, one difficult point was to handle terms that do not telescope. That is, if you look to eq (28) in the supp. material, the suboptimality terms $(L(w^t)-L(w^*))$ and $(L(w^{t+1})-L(w^*))$ do not telescope because they have different constants weighting these terms. To resolve this, we introduced artificial weights $\\alpha_t$ so that the suboptimality terms in eq (29) would telescope. This step is very different from a regular SGD proof.\n\n3) After telescoping eq (29), the weighted telescoping generated terms that grew exponentially, see the term in eq (33). We had to control the growth of this exponential term by making $T$ big enough, but this created a circular dependency between $T$ and the step size $\\eta$. Fortunately we were able to resolve this dependency, and still arrive at a. $1/\\sqrt{T}$ complexity result.\n\n\nRegarding the noise assumption, note that our theorem makes no assumption on the noise, which makes it more general than theorems that suppose a certain noise structure. The more classical SGD proofs assume that the stochastic gradients are bounded (equivalently the loss if Lipschitz), that is ||g_t|| <= D which is a fixed constant. We make no explicit assumption on the norm of the gradient, instead, we bound E||g_t|| as a result of assuming the loss is a smooth function, see Lemma A.1 in our paper. This Lemma A.1 and approach for bounding the gradient is standard when assuming smoothness. \n\n> The new results on generalization are justified mostly by experiments, rather than in theory.\n\nWhile the main text contains mostly experimental results, we discuss a possible theoretical approach in Appendix F.2. In short, we consider the shift of the minimum under data distribution shifts, and examine how curvature affects the average distance between the old minimum and the new minimum. The correlation depends on the shape of the minimum and may be more complicated beyond a two-dimensional parameter space. We leave a more systematic investigation to future work.\n\nHow sharpness affects generalization has been studied extensively but not yet fully understood [3]. We expect the theory on the curvature of minimum to be comparably complex and intriguing.\n\n> The main assumptions are not clearly stated. I would suggest separating the assumptions rather than stating them at the beginning of each result.

The intuition part makes sense to me since it has the quadratic error term that typically arises from second-order optimization but the convergence rate in Theorem 3.1 is still O(\\epsilon^{-4}), which is the same as SGD. The convergence guarantee is slightly stronger but I don't understand how we can claim teleportation accelerates the convergence rate of SGD.\n\nThis is a good question, and we agree that âacceleratesâ is not the correct word here. Instead, we give a stronger convergence guarantee by showing that all parameters on the orbit of the iterates converge to a stationary point at a O(\\epsilon^{-4}) rate, as opposed to the standard SGD theory which shows only the iterates converge at this rate. Thus the speed of convergence is the same, but the object that is converging (all points on the orbit) is a stronger notion of convergence.  We will re-word our contribution here accordingly, and thank the reviewer.\n\n> Even though the claim is teleportation improves the convergence rate for Adagrad, SGD with momentum, RMSProp, and Adam, the only clear improvements that I could see from Figure 5 is Adagrad. The other graphs seem to have similar performance for algorithm with or without teleportation.\n\nWe agree that the improvement brought by teleportation is less significant for algorithms other than SGD, perhaps due to how they handle gradients of different magnitudes. However, for all algorithms, the loss curve drops visibly faster right after teleportation, near the beginning of the training. Since teleportation does not have a significant impact on total runtime (last Figure in Appendix), we believe that it is still beneficial to integrate it with various optimizers.\n\n**Response to Questions**\n> âDoes cross-entropy loss satisfy the condition for one teleportation in section 3.3?

If it does, how do we pick the best epoch?â\n\nWe did not conduct a systematic investigation of when to teleport in this paper, but results in a previous paper [1] suggests that for the purpose of improving convergence, teleporting around the beginning of training leads to the most significant improvement. For improving generalization, we teleport when SGD is close to being converged, because the sharpness and curvature metrics are designed for when loss is near 0. Additionally, these quantities can change during training due to the implicit bias of optimization algorithms, so optimizing them early in the training may not be effective.\n\n> âIn page 7, it says teleporting to points with smaller curvature helps find a minimum with lower validation loss but in the left graph of figure 4, the loss when we move to a place with decreased curvature is actually higher.

Thanks for pointing it out!""}}, {'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for your comments and positive feedback! \n\nWe respectfully disagree that the theoretical results in the first part of Section 3 are not novel. Theorem 3.1 is the first global convergence theory that allows for teleportation. It was not trivial to identify that such a proof is possible, nor was it trivial to establish. There were three main technical challenges/innovations that set this theorem apart from a standard SGD theorem 1) finding the right proof structure and assumptions, 2) introducing a weighted telescoping, and  3) controlling an exponential terms with a cyclic dependency. Below we detail these three challenges. \n\n1) Before proving Theorems 3.1, we first had to find a proof structure and assumptions that could work with teleportation. Standard proofs based on convexity, or strong convexity, were not amenable to a teleportation step. The reason being that the teleportation step can move far away from the current iterate, which in turn breaks the recurrence relations required by these proofs. We found that only non-convex type proofs could allow for teleportation.\n\n2) After determining a smoothness type proof could work, one difficult point was to handle terms that do not telescope. That is, if you look to eq (28) in the supp. material, the suboptimality terms $(L(w^t)-L(w^*))$ and $(L(w^{t+1})-L(w^*))$ do not telescope because they have different constants weighting these terms. To resolve this, we introduced artificial weights $\\alpha_t$ so that the suboptimality terms in eq (29) would telescope. This step is very different from a regular SGD proof.\n\n3) After telescoping eq (29), the weighted telescoping generated terms that grew exponentially, see the term in eq (33). We had to control the growth of this exponential term by making $T$ big enough, but this created a circular dependency between $T$ and the step size $\\eta$. Fortunately we were able to resolve this dependency, and still arrive at a. $1/\\sqrt{T}$ complexity result.\n\n\n**Response to Questions**\n> âIt seems that Definition 3.3 doesn't exclude minimizers of $w \\mapsto |\\partial \\mathcal{L}/\\partial w|^2$. It might help the exposition to mention this.â\n\nThanks for the suggestion! We agree that this point is not clear in the original draft and have made this explicit in the revised version.\n\n> Figure 4 seems to show the opposite phenomenon to text description.\n\nThis is a typo in the text and has been fixed. Figure 4 shows that teleporting to points with *larger* curvatures helps find a minimum with lower validation loss, while teleporting to points with *smaller* curvatures has the opposite effect. This relationship is consistent with Table 1. For the dataset and architecture we examined, less curvature is associated with larger validation loss, which is associated with worse generalization.""}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the detailed comments. In the revised version, we have fixed the writing issues according to the list of minor remarks.\n\n**Clarity**\n\nWe appreciate the suggestions on the overall structure. Section 5 is placed at the end since while experiments in that section focus on optimization, teleportation can be integrated with other optimizers both to improve optimization and to improve generalization. We agree that a section dedicated to preliminaries and assumptions would be helpful, but currently it is difficult to add to the main text due to the page limit.

In the experiments, have you tried teleporting more often than just in the first epoch and whether it has a positive effect on convergence speed/generalization vs. the increase in runtime?â\n\nFor improving convergence, the runtime added by teleportation is negligible, but we observed that teleporting after the first epoch has almost no effect on convergence speed, which is consistent with the results in [2] (section 6.2). For improving generalization, performing a teleportation to change curvature is more time consuming. Under our current implementation, the extra cost does not justify teleporting more than once near a minimum.\n\n> â2. How did you decide on 10 and 1 gradient ascent steps, respectively, for the experiments?â\n\nThe number of gradient ascent steps is chosen such that the curvature or sharpness shows clear improvement but does not become large enough to cause divergence in the subsequent gradient descent steps.\n\n> â3. Do you have any (preliminary) results on how teleportation affects generalization for other optimizers (e.g., AdaGrad, Adam, etc.)?â\n\nThank you for the suggestion! We added a new experiment that investigates how teleportation affects generalization for AdaGrad (Figure 12 in the revised paper). We found that similar to SGD, changing curvature via teleportation affects the validation loss, while changing sharpness has negligible effects. Teleporting to points with larger curvatures helps find minima with slightly lower validation loss. Teleporting to points with smaller curvatures increases the gap between training and validation loss. \n\n> â4. This question goes beyond the scope of the paper, but I would be interested in your opinion on [1] in light of your contribution, a recent paper which challenges the current view on the correlation between sharpness and generalization.â\n\nThe paper by Andriushchenko et. al provides an extensive empirical study on the correlation between sharpness and generalization for transformers and ConvNets on large datasets. Their observations that sharpness does not correlate well with generalization and that the right sharpness measure is data-dependent reveals the complexity of the role of sharpness in generalization. Their results may also explain our observation that teleporting in symmetry directions to change sharpness has negligible effect on generalization. We expect curvature to have a comparably complex and intriguing effect on generalization. We believe that the link between sharpness/curvature and generalization is interesting and deserves further investigation, and we hope that teleportation could become useful as a tool to explore the minimum manifold.\n\n[1] Maksym Andriushchenko, Francesco Croce, Maximilian MÃ¼ller, Matthias Hein, Nicolas Flammarion.

Their first contribution is an analysis which shows that teleported SGD yields improved guarantees for SGD for smooth (possibly non-convex) functions. It was shown in [1] that teleportation (in the GD rather than SGD setting) is equivalent to a step of Newton\'s method, and they accordingly give an estimate of its contraction rate that demonstrates quadratic convergence as would be expected from a 2nd order method. Their final theoretical results are sufficient conditions for one teleportation step to be optimal for all times. They then provide empirical studies of the effects of teleportation for increasing/decreasing the sharpness and curvature of minima.

For example, if the model is pre-trained on ImageNet and then fine-tuned to PASCAL, it can significantly outperform that trained on PASCAL from scratch. While ImageNet pre-training has shown enormous success, it is formed in 2D, and the learned features are for classification tasks; when transferring to more diverse tasks, like 3D image segmentation, its performance is inevitably compromised due to the deviation from the original ImageNet context. A significant challenge lies in the lack of large, annotated 3D datasets rivaling the scale of ImageNet for model pre-training. To overcome this challenge, we make two contributions. Firstly, we construct AbdomenAtlas 1.1 that comprises 9,262 three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) volumes with high-quality, per-voxel annotations of 25 anatomical structures and pseudo annotations of seven tumor types. Secondly, we develop a suite of models that are pre-trained on our AbdomenAtlas 1.1 for transfer learning. Our preliminary analyses indicate that the model trained only with 21 CT volumes, 672 masks, and 40 GPU hours has a transfer learning ability similar to the model trained with 5,050 (unlabeled) CT volumes and 1,152 GPU hours. More importantly, the transfer learning ability of supervised models can further scale up with larger annotated datasets, achieving significantly better performance than preexisting pre-trained models, irrespective of their pre-training methodologies or data sources.

We appreciate your thoughtful feedback and accolades on our contribution: *âthe dataset appears to be comprehensive and holds great promiseâ¦making this dataset and the pretrained weights publicly available can contribute to advancements in the field.â*\n\n---\n\n> **Q1.** The weakness could relate to the details of the pretraining strategy. Typically, image-wise [1, 2] or pixel-wise [3] pre-training relies on the InfoNCE loss for clustering embedding samples in the latent space, rather than directly applying penalties based on labels via cross-entropy loss. It would be more interesting to observe results achieved through category-guided InfoNCE loss [4, 5] pre-training using this dataset.\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We must admit that category-guided InfoNCE loss was not our first try by default because it is not a standard approach for medical segmentation tasks as of now. [[Ma et al., MEDIA 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841521000815)] have listed all the popular losses for medical segmentation tasks, each of these loss functions may have their own strengths to specific scenarios, such as dealing with unbalanced class. Therefore, we initially selected a combination of Dice loss and binary cross-entropy loss, the most commonly used segmentation loss, as recommended by the introduction and Figure 1 in [[Ma et al., MEDIA 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841521000815)].\n\nBut we are very much interested in exploring more loss options. Category-guided InfoNCE loss, as you suggested, is potentially good because it can cluster embedding samples in the latent space and has proven effective for supervised learning in natural image classification [4] and segmentation tasks [5]. Thanks for sharing the references. The references [1, 2, 3], however, discussed self-supervised learning, so their applicability and effectiveness in the context of supervised learning for segmentation tasks might not have been thoroughly explored. Following your suggestion, a comprehensive comparison between InfoNCE loss and our dice + bce loss will be included in our final version.\n\n---\n\n> **Q2.** Additionally, there exist many promising domain transfer methods, yet the paper appears to lack exploration in this area. The current approach appears to be straightforward fine-tuning on other datasets, such as TotalSegmentator and JHH.\n\nThe current approach is pretty robust (evidenced in Table 3) because our dataset covers a variety of domains (i.e., 68 hospitals with different scanners and protocols). Therefore, models pre-trained on this dataset are expected to be generalizable for novel domains, e.g., TotalSegmentator, FLAREâ23, and JHH. These three datasets are completely unseen during the pre-training and represent a variety of diversity. Specifically, the TotalSegmentator dataset represents for the Central European population from Switzerland, the FLAREâ23 dataset represents for East Asian population from China, and the JHH dataset represents for another population (anonymous for peer review). Our models achieve comparable or even superior performance to the IID counterparts (Table 3). Therefore, domain transfer becomes less important if the model is pre-trained on large and diverse datasets (elaborated in the next two points).\n\n1. The domain transfer problem could be solved by methodology innovation, as you suggested, and also by training AI models on enormous datasets. This point has been more clear recently demonstrated by large language models (GPT) and vision foundation models (SAM), which show incredible performance in ânew domainâ. However, this achievement may not be directly attributed to method-driven solutions for domain transfer, but simply because the AI might have been trained on similar sentences or images. This was also pointed out by Yann Lecunâ*â[beware of testing on the training set](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1723752958037315874)â*âin response to the incredible results achieved by GPT.\n\n2. In some sense, our paper explores dataset-driven solutions for domain transfer. The robust performance of our models when direct inference on multiple domains could also be attributed to our large-scale, fully-annotated medical datasetâas one of our major contributions. The release of this dataset can foster AI models that are more robust than the majority of existing models that are only trained on a few hundred CT volumes from limited domains. We completely agree that existing domain transfer methods could be supplemented with direct inference and fine-tuning to further improve AI performance.\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n- Ma, Jun, Jianan Chen, Matthew Ng, Rui Huang, Yu Li, Chen Li, Xiaoping Yang, and Anne L.

Thank you so much for praising our pre-trained models as *âhuge assets for medical imagingâ*.\n\n---\n\n> **Q1.** UniverSeg [1] is another paper that trains networks on a very large dataset, 22K scans, which is even larger than this paper. Although Arxiv version of UniverSeg is available since April 2023, I see this work and UniverSeg as concurrent works since UniverSeg is recently presented in ICCV. However, I still think that mentioning UniverSeg and discussing the similarities/differences in the final version would be useful.\n\nThank you for sharing UniverSeg with usâits relevance to our work is significant and appreciated. We have now included a discussion of UniverSeg, along with other concurrent and related works, in the revised Section 2. These works share a level of **similarity** with ours, aiming to develop medical AI models that can segment multiple anatomical structures and generalize to out-of-distribution datasets.\n\n**Opinions on UniverSeg.** UniverSeg demonstrates an impressive ability to generalize across various unseen tasks and modalities without the need for fine-tuning, offering computational efficiency. However, its current performance falls short of the benchmarks set by fine-tuned models (as their upper bound reference). **In contrast**, our research aims to advance the fine-tuning performance by pre-training models on larger, per-voxel annotated datasets. We believe that our ImageNetCT-9K dataset could also further enhance UniverSeg\'s generalization ability.\n\n**Perspectives on additional related and future work** The forthcoming public release of ImageNetCT-9K and SuPreM is anticipated to positively influence Segment Anything Models (SAM) within the medical field. We hold the same belief with [[Kirillov et al. ICCV 2023](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Kirillov_Segment_Anything_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf)] that the foundation models for image segmentation require supervised training on board data at scale, and we both contribute to a large-scale annotated dataset in the respective field. In addition, we already have some proof of concept that the model tends to understand **objectness** in a broader sense through full supervision in Table 4.\n\n---\n\n> **Q2.** How do the models trained on the collected large CT dataset generalize to novel modalities such as MRI?\n\nThis is a very good point. We think transfer learning across different imaging modalities, such as from CT to MRI, might be less effective compared to transfers within the same modality, primarily due to the significant differences in their imaging techniques. The discrepancies in image acquisition methods between CT and MRI result in distinct intensity values and ranges. Nonetheless, our pre-trained model could still be valuable for abdominal MRI applications. This is because the underlying anatomical structures remain consistent across both CT and MRI, allowing for the potential transfer of shared knowledge.\n\nGiven the constraints of time, we are unable to include this specific experiment in the rebuttal period. However, we plan to incorporate a study focused on **abdominal MRI tasks** in the final version of our paper. With the release of our ImageNetCT-9K and SuPreM, we look forward to promoting a collaborative effort to thoroughly evaluate the capabilities of transfer learning. This includes exploring a wider range of medical modalities, such as T1, T1c, T2, Flair, and Ultrasound, and extending into general 3D vision tasks involving diverse data formats like point clouds, voxel occupancy grids, meshes, and implicit surface models (e.g., signed distance functions). We have now included in the future work section and Appendix F.4.\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n- Kirillov, Alexander, Eric Mintun, Nikhila Ravi, Hanzi Mao, Chloe Rolland, Laura Gustafson, Tete Xiao et al.

What was the time cost involved, and so on?\n\nThank you very much for the suggestion. We have now enclosed this information in the revised Section 3.1 and Appendix B.3.\n\n**Automated organ annotations.** Our annotation pipeline involved an interactive segmentation approach, an integration of AI algorithms and human expertise, which premises to improve the efficiency while upholding high-quality annotations. *One senior radiologist* revised the annotations predicted by our AI models, and in turn, the AI models improved their predictions by learning from these revised annotations. This interactive process continued to enhance the quality of annotations until no major revision is needed. Subsequently, *five junior radiologists* examine the final visualizations for accuracy (examples of the rendered images are illustrated in Appendix B.3 Figure 7). The junior radiologists were responsible for reviewing the correctness of the annotations and marking the patient ID for any major discrepancies. Such cases are then reviewed by the senior radiologist. Our uniform annotation standards, largely overlapping with those in [[Ma et al., FLARE 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05862)], require trained radiologists to spend approximately 30â60 minutes annotating each organ in a three-dimensional CT volume. \n\n**Automated (pseudo) tumor annotations.** We have established uniform annotation standards for tumors, with both senior and junior radiologists actively refining and adhering to these guidelines.\n\n- Liver tumors: Liver tumors include primary tumor lesions and metastases in the liver. Annotations should encompass the entire tumor, including any invasive parts, necrosis, hemorrhage, fibrous scars, and calcifications. Healthy areas or unrelated lesions are not included.\n\n- Kidney tumors: Kidney tumors include both benign and malignant tumor lesions growing in the kidneys. The entire tumor and its invasive parts to surrounding areas, plus internal changes like necrosis and calcification, should be annotated. Exclude healthy structures.\n\n- Pancreatic tumors: Pancreatic tumors include all benign and malignant tumor lesions growing in the pancreas. Annotations cover the whole tumor and its invasive growth into adjacent areas, including changes like cysts, necrosis, and calcification. Exclude healthy structures.\n\n- Colon tumors: Colon tumors include all benign and malignant tumor lesions developing from the colon wall. The entire tumor and its invasion into nearby structures, along with internal changes like necrosis, should be annotated, excluding healthy areas.\n\n- Hepatic vessel tumors: Hepatic vessel tumors include all primary tumor lesions developing from the intrahepatic vessel wall and tumor thrombus in intrahepatic vessels. Annotations should include the tumor within the vessels, excluding external parts and unrelated lesions.\n\nOverall, our ImageNetCT-9K dataset offers **51.8K** pseudotumor masks visually inspected by radiologists, though without biopsy confirmation. While these masks lack pathological validation, we anticipate they will serve as a valuable foundation for expanding precise tumor annotations in future research.\n\n---\n\n> **Q7.** The ""novel datasets"" claimed in Table 3 is inappropriate. It should be referred to as the external dataset.\n\nThanks for your suggestion, we have revised the âexternal datasetâ in Table 3 in the new version.\n\n---\n\n> **Q8.** This paper uses internal medical data for training, so it may need ethical approval for use.\n\nThe internal medical data has received IRB approval for use. In Appendix B.1 Table 5, we\'ve detailed the source and permissions for data release. Our approach involves disseminating only the annotations of the CT volumes, which users can combine with the original CT volumes obtained from their original sources. All data created and licensed out by us will be in separate files, ensuring no modifications to the original CT volumes. Legal consultations confirm our permission to distribute these **annotations** under the licenses of each dataset. Upon acceptance of the paper, we will release the entire ImageNetCT-9K dataset to the public. This dataset will provide **296K** organ/tumor masks and **3.7M** annotated images that are taken from **68** hospitals worldwide. And this dataset will continue to expand with the collective effort from the community.\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n- Ma, Jun, Yao Zhang, Song Gu, Cheng Ge, Shihao Ma, Adamo Young, Cheng Zhu et al.

Although there is no comparison with totalsegmentator, the performance of totalsegmentator trained on 1000 data seems to surpass what is reported in Table 4. For example, totalsegmentator can achieve over 95% Dice on iliopsoas, while it is less than 90% in the paper.\n\nIn TotalSegmentator, the labels were largely generated by a **single** nnU-Net re-trained continually (see Figure 1b in [Wasserthal et al.](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/ryai.230024)). Depending solely on nnU-Net could introduce a potential label bias favoring the nnU-Net architecture. This means two points. \n\n1. Their ground truth (revised pseudo labels) could be biased to the nnU-Net architecture. nnU-Net trained and tested on this dataset will achieve an **unreachable** performance as shown in Totalsegmentator [github](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator/blob/master/resources/evaluate_results.txt). For example, they report the DSC score of 0.894 for pancreas segmentation, this number has never been reached literature. The MSD top 1 result (**[0.828](https://decathlon-10.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/challenge/leaderboard/)**); TCIA Pancreas-CT Dataset top 1 result (**[0.845](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/pancreas-segmentation-on-tcia-pancreas-ct)**); even the FELIX Project (producing the largest pancreas dataset in USA) only achieves **[0.87](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.24.22280071v1)** DSC score. None of these advanced benchmarks have achieved 0.894 reported in Totalsegmentator. Therefore, it is sensible to assume the ground truth is biased to the nnU-Net architecture (including iliopsoas that you mentioned and many other classses). This is the reason why we do not make comparisons with Totalsegmentator. \n\n2. Due to the potential label biases, whenever TotalSegmentator is employed for benchmarking, nnU-Net and models building upon nnU-Net would always outperform other segmentation architectures (e.g., UNETR, TransUNet, SwinUNet, etc.). This observation has also been made in several publications that used the TotalSegmentator dataset. For example, Table 3 in [[Huang et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06716)] showed that nnFormer, UNETR, and Swin UNETR were all outperformed by nnU-Net and models building upon nnU-Net in TotalSegmentator. More importantly, the average DSC achieved by our model on TotalSegmentator is also much higher than [[Huang et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06716)] as compared in the following table.\n\n| method &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | organ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | vertebrae &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | cardiac &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | muscle &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | \n|  ----  | ----  |  ----  |  ----  |  ----  | \n| [Huang et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06716) | 89.82 | 90.43 | 90.89 | 88.83 |\n| Ours | **92.09** | **91.29** | **92.21** | **95.40** | \n\nTherefore, we believe that the segmentation results in TotalSegmentator reported in our paper are **compelling** and should be considered a **faithful** benchmark.\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n- Wasserthal, Jakob, Hanns-Christian Breit, Manfred T.

Although the authors claim that collecting 9000 data is their contribution, the same 9000 data were not used for pre-training when compared with other self-supervised/supervised pre-training methods. Therefore, it is not rigorous to conclude that SPT is superior to other supervised/self-supervised methods. \n\nThank you for your valuable feedback. Ensuring a fair and rigorous comparison is our top priority. Therefore, we must clarify that while we have developed and released a suite of models pre-trained on 9K data, these models were NOT used for comparisons against other self-supervised/supervised pre-training methods within this paper. The only experiment that used 9K-models was the direct inference on external datasets (Table 3), where we benchmarked against methods trained specifically on those datasets, representing an upper bound in performance. This benchmark is to ensure that the released models are the most effective and robust ones (as we could provide) for the research community to directly use.\n\nFor the other experiments, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of supervised pre-training relative to other pre-training methods, so we designed them within a controlled setting. \n\n1. For supervised pre-training, the largest study to date was by [[Liu et al., ICCV 2023](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Liu_CLIP-Driven_Universal_Model_for_Organ_Segmentation_and_Tumor_Detection_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf)], which was developed on 3,410 (2,100 for training and 1,310 for validation) annotated CT volumes. For self-supervised pre-training, the largest one was by [[Tang et al., CVPR 2022](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Tang_Self-Supervised_Pre-Training_of_Swin_Transformers_for_3D_Medical_Image_Analysis_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)], which was trained on 5,050 unannotated CT volumes. To do a rigorous comparison, we **benchmarked** with these advanced pre-training methods by pre-training our model using 2,100 CT volumes (*same as Liu et al. and fewer than Tang et al.*) in the Table 2, Figure 1 and Appendix C.2 Figure 8.\n2. We further **scaled down** the number of CT volumes to 21 to explore the edge of our supervised pre-training method. Surprisingly, Figure 2a shows these experiments and demonstrates that the model trained with 21 CT volumes, 672 masks, and 40 GPU hours shows a transfer learning ability similar to [[Tang et al., CVPR 2022](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Tang_Self-Supervised_Pre-Training_of_Swin_Transformers_for_3D_Medical_Image_Analysis_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)] trained with 5,050 CT volumes and 1,152 GPU hours.\n3. Lastly, we **scaled up** the SOTA self-supervised method [[Tang et al., CVPR 2022](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Tang_Self-Supervised_Pre-Training_of_Swin_Transformers_for_3D_Medical_Image_Analysis_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)] by pre-training it on the same 9K CT volumes. Under this similar setting, our supervised pre-training 9K model substantially outperforms the SOTA self-supervised 9K-model (see Appendix C2 Table 8). \n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n- Liu, Jie, Yixiao Zhang, Jie-Neng Chen, Junfei Xiao, Yongyi Lu, Bennett A Landman, Yixuan Yuan, Alan Yuille, Yucheng Tang, and Zongwei Zhou.

The introduction discusses pre-training strategies for 3D vision tasks, but the experiments are all conducted on medical images. It is well known that there are significant differences between medical images and natural images, and whether the experimental conclusions on 3D CT data can be extended to other 3D vision tasks is not explored in the paper.\n\nWe completely agree with your comments and have now revised our title, abstract, introduction, and conclusion to narrow down our current research scope to 3D medical imaging. \n\nThe potential applications and implications of our dataset have now been included in the future work section. Given that our dataset includes detailed per-voxel annotations for 25 organs and tumors, it enables the automatic generation of 3D shape representations. These representations can be formatted as point clouds, voxel occupancy grids, meshes, and implicit surface models (e.g., signed distance functions), each catering to different algorithmic needs. We anticipate our dataset could be useful for a variety of other 3D medical vision tasks [[Li et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16139)], such as pose estimation, surface reconstruction, depth estimation, etc. \n\n---\n\n> **Q3.** The fused dataset of over 9000 CT cases collected by the authors includes segmentation of 32 organs and tumors, but the evaluation in the experimental section focuses more on organs, lacking an evaluation of tumor segmentation performance. Comparatively, organ segmentation is less challenging in terms of generalization, while tumor segmentation is more complex. In the external dataset, more focus should be given to tumor segmentation, as it is more susceptible to a series of generalization issues caused by differences in populations, devices, and diseases in practical application scenarios.\n\n**Tumor-related tasks** were evaluated in Figure 1. Due to space constraints and the breadth of our experiments, we initially averaged the performance metrics for both tumor and organ segmentation in Figure 1, for which we apologize if this led to any confusion. We completely agree with you that evaluating tumor-related tasks is much more significant and challenging than organ tasks. We have now explicitly reported tumor segmentation performance in Table 4 and tumor classification performance in Figure 3. \n\nWe would like to stress the challenges in benchmarking tumor segmentation/classification, particularly due to the scarcity of annotations in publicly available datasets (often limited to hundreds of tumors). To overcome this limitation, we employed our proprietary dataset, which comprises **3,577** annotated pancreatic tumors, including detailed sub-types: **1,704 PDACs**, **945 Cysts**, and **928 PanNets**. This extensive dataset enabled us to thoroughly assess the transfer learning ability of our pre-trained models in tumor-related tasks. Notably, the transfer learning results detailed in Appendix E.4 Figure 13 demonstrate a sensitivity of 86.1% and specificity of 95.4% for PDAC detection. This performance surpasses the average radiologist\'s performance in PDAC identification by 27.6% in sensitivity and 4.4% in specificity, as reported in [[Cao et al., Nat Med 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02640-w)]. This is one of the demonstration how our pre-trained models can be deployed for clinical applications. If we have an honor to present this work at ICLR, we can perhaps elaborate more.\n\n**Generalization issues.** Thanks for bringing this into our attention. Through our experiment, we have shown the generalizability in terms of populations in Table 3 (i.e. TotalSegmentator (representing the Central European population from Switzerland) and FLAREâ23 (the East Asian population from China)). Moreover, our proprietary dataset contains CT scans taken by a variety of vendors, e.g. Siemens, GE, Philips, and Toshiba, as well as scanners 16-/64-slice MDCT and Dual-source MDCT. The promising results in all three external datasetsâwith various populations, devices, and diseasesâsuggest the clinical impact of our pre-trained models in practical application scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n- Li, Jianning, Antonio Pepe, Christina Gsaxner, Gijs Luijten, Yuan Jin, Narmada Ambigapathy, Enrico Nasca et al.

In the following, we have provided a point-by-point response to all questions raised.\n\n---\n\n> **Q1.** The paper explores the transferability of supervised learning by combining multiple 3D CT segmentation datasets. Similar work has been done in various fields, such as training various tasks and data in computer vision, which has shown improved results across tasks. This paper incorporates 3D CT data and tasks, with the only difference being the collection of more publicly available and private data, without bringing new insights or technological innovations to the community. \n\nCreating large-scale (9K) per-voxel annotated medical datasets of over 25 classes and making this resource publicly available takes a village. Your acknowledgment of our dataset as *âthe largest dataset for multi-organ segmentation currently availableâ* is greatly appreciated. While it is common in computer vision to improve performance through joint training on a combination of existing datasets, our study overcomes technical barriers and brings new insights as follows.\n\n1. ImageNetCT-9K is NOT a simple combination of existing datasets. We have now included Appendix B.1 Figure 5, in conjunction with Table 5, to better illustrate the evolution from public datasets to our ImageNetCT-9K. The 9K CT volumes in the combination of public datasets only contain a total of **39K** annotated organ masks, while our ImageNetCT-9K provides **296K** annotated organ/tumor masks for these CT volumes, substantially increasing the number of masks by **7.6** times.\n\n2. Creating **296K** high-quality organ/tumor masks for 9K CT volumes requires extensive medical knowledge and annotation cost (much more difficult than annotating natural images). Based on our experience and those reported in [[Park et al., Diagnostic and interventional imaging 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31358460/)], trained radiologists annotate abdominal organs at a rate of 30â60 minutes per organ per three-dimensional CT volume. This translates to **247K** human hours for completing ImageNetCT-9K. We employed a highly efficient annotation method, combining AI with the expertise of three radiologists using active learning (details in **Q6**), to overcome this challenge and produce the largest annotated dataset to date.\n\n3. ImageNetCT-9K can be used as a training resource and a testbed for AI algorithms. As acknowledged by Reviewer fMfJ, it can *âhave a good impact on the whole community.â* Our study introduces **new insights** on the use of ImageNetCT-9K in transfer learning. We delve into a key debate within general computer vision: the comparative effectiveness of representation learning via human-annotated data (supervised pre-training) versus raw data (self-supervised pre-training). As Reviewer fMfJ acknowledged, *âthis paper concluded on the debate of whether self-supervised or supervised pre-training lead to better performance and data efficiency. This debate **had not be resolved** without the invention of a fully-annotation dataset of such scale.â* We are committed to making ImageNetCT-9K publicly available, thereby enabling further research to derive insights from various angles and foster technological innovations.

The potential applications and implications of our dataset have now been included in the future work section and Appendix F.4.\n\n---\n\n> **Q4.** Is there anything surprising from the results? I think it is clear that if you have rich segmentation labels you can learn a better segmentation model than via self-supervised learning. I think the main point of the paper should be that this is a new dataset that will be valuable to the community, not that rich supervision is useful in segmentation.\n\nThank you for recognizing the value of our dataset. As detailed in **Q1**, we have systematically benchmarked the transfer learning ability of public models and are preparing to release a suite of models that are pre-trained on our extensive, annotated dataset. The download links are available in our common responses. These two contributions align closely with the conference of *Learning Representation* (IC*LR*) and our submission is categorized into the *âdatasets and benchmarksâ* primary area.\n\nThe debate between the effectiveness of representation learning using human-annotated data (supervised pre-training) versus raw data (self-supervised pre-training) has been a longstanding topic in general computer vision, as we review in Section 2. As acknowledged by Reviewer fMfJ, *this paper concluded on the debate of whether self-supervised or supervised pre-training leads to better performance and data efficiency. This debate had not be resolved without the invention of a fully-annotation dataset of such scale.* Our constructed dataset enables this crucial comparison and promises to be a valuable asset for future algorithm benchmarking in the field.\n\nBased on our comparison, two observations are particularly surprising. Please note that in this comparison, the model is transferred to the classes and datasets that differ from those used for pre-training.\n\n1. Efficiency in pretext task: Supervised pre-training requires **99.6%** fewer data and **96.5%** less computation than self-supervised pre-training. The model trained with 21 CT volumes, 672 masks, and 40 GPU hours shows a transfer learning ability similar to that trained with 5,050 CT volumes and 1,152 GPU hours. See details in Figure 2a.\n\n2. Efficiency in target task: Supervised pre-training requires **50%** fewer manual annotations for fine-grained tumor classification than self-supervised pre-training. This is particularly critical for tumor imaging tasks because annotating tumors requires much more effort and often relies on the availability of pathology reports. See details in Figure 2b and Appendix D.1 Figure 9.\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n- Li, Jianning, Antonio Pepe, Christina Gsaxner, Gijs Luijten, Yuan Jin, Narmada Ambigapathy, Enrico Nasca et al.

If I understood it correctly, the word ""transfer"" in the title is not referring to transfer learning in this case, but simply asking whether supervision is also good for 3D data as it has been for 2D data. When first reading the title, I thought you were exploring transferring 2D supervised models to 3D tasks. Others may also make that incorrect assumption.\n\nThe word âtransferâ in the title refers to transfer learning, a procedure that involves two stages. **Firstly**, a model is pre-trained on a pretext task, specifically organ segmentation in our paper. **Secondly**, the model is transferred (fine-tuned) to multiple target tasks, including new datasets, classes, and tasks. The target task performance can indicate whether the model pre-training is helpful compared with (1) learning the model from scratch and (2) other publicly available pre-trained models. In this paper, we have assessed the transfer learning ability of models under **five distinct settings**. \n1. Transfer to different datasets (domains) to segment the same organsâclasses that were used for pre-training (Appendix E.2 Table 10).\n2. Transfer to segmentation tasks of organs, muscles, vertebrae, and cardiac structuresâclasses that were not used for pre-training (revised Table 4; Appendix E.3 Table 11).\n3. Transfer to segmentation tasks of pancreatic tumor segmentationâmore challenging classes that were not used for pre-training (revised Table 4; Appendix E.3 Table 11).\n4. Transfer to few-shot segmentation tasks using only a limited number of annotated CT volumesâclasses that were not used for pre-training (Figure 1; Figure 2b; Appendix D.1 Figure 9).\n5. *New:* Transfer to classification tasks that identify fine-grained tumors, including PDAC, Cyst, and PanNet in JHH (Figure 3).\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback regarding our title. We agree the previous title can be confusing and de-appreciate our contribution. We have now revised it to **âHow Well Do Supervised 3D Models Transfer to Medical Imaging Tasks?â** and are actively considering further refinements for greater clarity. One of the contributions of our study, as described in Section 3.2, is the systematic benchmarking of transfer learning performance, particularly from 3D segmentation tasks to a wider range of 3D imaging tasks. Another contribution is the creation of large-scale, per-voxel annotated ImageNetCT-9K, which in turn, makes the transfer learning benchmarking possible.\n\n---\n\n> **Q2.** The use of the word âImageNetâ in the dataset name may want to be reconsidered. Besides being a large dataset with a variety of anatomy, the link to ImageNet is a bit weak and may also suggest properties that the dataset does not have (e.g., per-image classification labels).\n\nOur objective in developing ImageNetCT-9K is to drive algorithmic advancements and set new benchmarks in the field of 3D medical imaging. In many ways, our dataset echoes the early days of ImageNet, as both datasets emerged at times when large-scale data, diverse classes, and detailed labels were sparse in their respective fields. The limitations of publicly available datasets have been summarized with statistics in Appendix B.1 Table 5 and Figure 5.\n\nSegmentation is often conceptualized as per-voxel classification. In the medical domain, segmentation holds the same fundamental importance as classification does in general computer vision [[Ma & Wang, Nature Methods 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01885-0)]. We bet that ImageNet-like datasets in the medical domain should be formed as per-voxel segmentation labels. Our dataset aligns with this vision by providing per-voxel labels, offering a level of detail far surpassing ImageNet\'s per-image labels. Concretely, the per-voxel labels in our dataset (**272.7B annotated voxels**) are much more extensive than the per-image labels in ImageNet (**14M annotated images**).\n\nWe really appreciate your suggestions and are actively looking for better names for our dataset to deliver our vision more precisely for the medical imaging field and to inspire further research endeavors towards this end.\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n- Ma, Jun, and Bo Wang.

Our intent is not to compare the specific pre-training methodologies of each model for two primary reasons. **Firstly**, the majority of researchers tend to fine-tune pre-existing models rather than retrain them from scratch due to convenience and accessibility. **Secondly**, reproducing these models would require specialized hyper-parameter tuning and varied computational resources. For example, models like Swin UNETR [[Tang et al., CVPR 2023](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Tang_Self-Supervised_Pre-Training_of_Swin_Transformers_for_3D_Medical_Image_Analysis_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)] are pre-trained using large-scale GPU clusters at NVIDIA, making them challenging for us to faithfully retrain. Considering both practical user scenarios and computational constraints, we decided to directly use their released models and fine-tune them with consistent settings on the same datasets.\n\nUsing existing pre-trained models can inevitably lead to certain problems. For example, the U-Net family has seen numerous variations over the years [[Siddique et al., 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9446143)]. Pre-trained models released before 2021 typically employed a basic version of U-Net (e.g., [[Zhou et al., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405596/)] and [[Chen et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00625)] in Table 2). On the other hand, our U-Net benefits from a more advanced code base, thanks to the [MONAI](https://monai.io/) platform at NVIDIA, which includes enhanced architectures and advanced training optimization strategies. Consequently, our U-Net, even trained from scratch, is capable of surpassing the performance of these older baseline models.\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n- Tang, Yucheng, Dong Yang, Wenqi Li, Holger R.

With the growing trend of using pre-trained models, there is a need for standardized, accessible approaches to sharing public model weights. In line with this, we have released a suite of pre-trained models summarized in the table below for reviewers and the public audience. Releasing pre-trained foundation models should be considered a marked contribution as they offer an alternative way of knowledge sharing while protecting patient privacy [[Zhang et al.

Our approach involves disseminating only the annotations of the CT volumes, which users can combine with the original CT volumes obtained from their original sources (Reviewers bY7Q and osvs). All data created and licensed out by us will be in separate files, ensuring no modifications to the original CT volumes. Legal consultations confirm our permission to distribute these annotations under the licenses of each dataset. Upon acceptance of the paper, we will also release the entire ImageNetCT-9K dataset to the public. This dataset will provide **296K** organ/tumor masks and **3.7M** annotated images that are taken from **68** hospitals worldwide. And this dataset will continue to expand with the collective effort from the community.\n\n- **Can models, pre-trained on 3D medical data, transfer to other 3D vision tasks?**\nIn our revised manuscript, we have updated both the abstract and introduction to more accurately reflect our research findings in 3D medical image analysis (Reviewers esgA and bY7Q). The potential of transferring our pre-trained models to alternative imaging modalities and broader 3D vision tasks has been discussed in the future work section.\n\n---\n\n**III. Major updates**\n\n1. We have stressed the significance of our pre-trained models in transfer learning using the five experimental settings clarified above (see revised Section 4; Appendix A).\n\n2. We have detailed the procedure for constructing and annotating our dataset, combining the best of three expert radiologists and an AI algorithm using a uniform standard. (see revised Section 3.1; Appendix B.3).\n\n3. We have justified the performance obtained by ""scratch"" and other publicly available pre-trained models to avoid potential confusion (see revised Table 2; Appendix C.2 Table 8).\n\n4. We have clarified the experimental settings between self-supervised and supervised pre-training adopted in our comparison (see revised Section 3.2 and Section 4).\n\n5. We have justified with explicit evidence that our pre-trained models could address the domain transfer problem. More discussions about the direct inference results are presented in the Table 3 caption. \n\n6. We have included more related works, elaborated our future work, and revised figures, tables, and main text to provide a more coherent, comprehensive, and compact presentation (see revised Section 2; Section 5; Appendix F.4).\n\nIn addition, we have also taken this revision opportunity to further improve our manuscript in the following aspects.\n\n7. We have investigated the **cross-task** ability of our pre-trained models by transferring from organ segmentation to fine-grained tumor classification. The distance between the two tasks is much larger than transferring among segmentation tasks, so we hope the new result in Figure 3 can further strengthen the practical impact of our pre-trained models.\n\n8. We have shown the **annotation efficiency** achieved by our pre-trained models. This is particularly critical for tumor imaging tasks because annotating tumors requires much more effort and often relies on the availability of pathology reports. Our results in Figure 2b and Appendix D.1 Figure 9 suggest that fine-tuning our models can reduce annotation costs for organ segmentation and fine-grained tumor classification by 50%.\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n- Zhang, Shaoting, and Dimitris Metaxas.

Others may also make that incorrect assumption.\n\n- The use of the word ""ImageNet"" in the dataset name may want to be reconsidered.

The conclusion that supervised pre-training has an advantage over other pre-training methods in 3D medical imaging is generalized to general 3D vision tasks in an inconsistent manner. The introduction discusses pre-training strategies for 3D vision tasks, but the experiments are all conducted on medical images. It is well known that there are significant differences between medical images and natural images, and whether the experimental conclusions on 3D CT data can be extended to other 3D vision tasks is not explored in the paper.\n3. The fused dataset of over 9000 CT cases collected by the authors includes segmentation of 32 organs and tumors, but the evaluation in the experimental section focuses more on organs, lacking an evaluation of tumor segmentation performance. Comparatively, organ segmentation is less challenging in terms of generalization, while tumor segmentation is more complex. In the external dataset, more focus should be given to tumor segmentation, as it is more susceptible to a series of generalization issues caused by differences in populations, devices, and diseases in practical application scenarios.\n4. Unfair comparison in the experimental section is a fatal flaw. Although the authors claim that collecting 9000 data is their contribution, the same 9000 data were not used for pre-training when comparing with other self-supervised/supervised pre-training methods. Therefore, it is not rigorous to conclude that SPT is superior to other supervised/self-supervised methods.\n5. The results of fine-tuning SPT on 63 novel classes are not impressive. Although there is no comparison with totalsegmentator, the performance of totalsegmentator trained on 1000 data seems to surpass what is reported in Table 4.

A significant challenge lies in the lack of large, annotated 3D datasets rivaling the scale of ImageNet for model pre-training. To overcome this challenge, we make two contributions. Firstly, we construct AbdomenAtlas 1.1 that comprises **9,262** three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) volumes with high-quality, per-voxel annotations of 25 anatomical structures and pseudo annotations of seven tumor types. Secondly, we develop a suite of models that are pre-trained on our AbdomenAtlas 1.1 for transfer learning. Our preliminary analyses indicate that the model trained only with 21 CT volumes, 672 masks, and 40 GPU hours has a transfer learning ability similar to the model trained with 5,050 (unlabeled) CT volumes and 1,152 GPU hours. More importantly, the transfer learning ability of supervised models can further scale up with larger annotated datasets, achieving significantly better performance than preexisting pre-trained models, irrespective of their pre-training methodologies or data sources.

We find real-world software engineering to be a rich, sustainable, and challenging testbed for evaluating the next generation of language models. To this end, we introduce SWE-bench, an evaluation framework consisting of 2,294 software engineering problems drawn from real GitHub issues and corresponding pull requests across 12 popular Python repositories. Given a codebase along with a description of an issue to be resolved, a language model is tasked with editing the codebase to address the issue. Resolving issues in SWE-bench frequently requires understanding and coordinating changes across multiple functions, classes, and even files simultaneously, calling for models to interact with execution environments, process extremely long contexts and perform complex reasoning that goes far beyond traditional code generation tasks. Our evaluations show that both state-of-the-art proprietary models and our fine-tuned model SWE-Llama can resolve only the simplest issues. The best-performing model, Claude 2, is able to solve a mere 1.96% of the issues.

Please refer to the general response for more information on this concern.\n\n3. **Results are hard to interpret/distinguish between models**: We find that many of the challenges to solving long-context code problems are common to all models evaluated. While our results show that some models have better average success, overall performance on SWE-bench is so low across the board that it can be difficult to differentiate between modelsâ behavior. We think that SWE-bench can provide an important benchmark in guiding LM progress on the continual refinement of long context understanding, high and low-level reasoning, and grounded generation.\n\n4. **Is there a need for a benchmark even simpler than SWE-bench?**: LM progress moves fast and evaluation benchmarks are quickly outdated. We believe that setting a bar as high as SWE-bench is of great interest to the community since it could serve as a more persistent aspirational achievement for LMs. Achieving high accuracy on SWE-bench would be both incredibly useful to actual software engineers and also indicate substantial technical progress in the development of LMs. \nAdditionally, provided the structure of SWE-bench, it is possible for users to evaluate their models in slightly simpler settings (e.g. with the Oracle and Oracle-collapsed baseline), which can provide researchers some improved insights in the development of their own models.\n\nThank you again for your feedback; weâve uploaded a new version of the paper which addresses your concerns.

SWE-bench is an extremely useful goalpost for evaluating future LMs and automating software engineering.\n* **Automatic Collection Pipeline**: SWE-bench is easily updatable with new issue-PR pairs from GitHub in case current LLMs memorize existing issues thanks to our carefully designed collection pipeline. Our pipeline can be pointed at new repositories to turn existing codebases into SWE-bench style testbeds.\n* **SWE-Llama training data, code, and weights**: Open source models are entirely ineffective at the SWE-bench task. SWE-Llama is a critical proof-of-concept that shows the community that open source models can perform on par with proprietary SOTA models.\n* **Experiments & Analysis**: We provide baseline performance and insights for various state of the art models.

It only shows some preliminary results on small datasets and noisy simulations, without any statistical analysis or comparison with baselines.""\n\nR: As we discuss in the paper, in order to demonstrate real quantum advantage, we will require quantum computers (QCs) with at least a few hundred qubits that are very well connected (or have extremely efficient ""swap"" operations) and have very high multi-qubit gate fidelity. Unfortunately, such devices are likely few years away, and we will not be able to demonstrate true quantum advantage for NISQ-TDA using existing quantum computers. \nUsing current quantum computers, we can compute Betti numbers of small datasets, as demonstrated in our paper, and for such datasets, exact Betti numbers can be easily known. To the best of our knowledge, the baseline QTDA algorithm cannot be implemented on current hardware without fault tolerance, and there are no classical baselines to compute high-order Betti numbers (the problem is NP hard). \nWe wish to note that real quantum advantage has not been demonstrated on any practically useful problems so far. We strongly believe our work makes an important contribution in this direction, by presenting a novel quantum algorithm for a useful problem (that is known to be classical hard), which does not suffer from data loading problems, requires short depth and with potential speedup.

The advantage for solving the problem of deciding whether a simplicial complex has exponentially many holes seems less clear and perhaps less practical. It would be great to know if the algorithm still provides speedup for real-world instances.""\n\nR: This is a good point. Indeed, in order to achieve real quantum advantage (super-polynomial to exponential speedup), we require simplicial complexes with exponentially many holes, and it is not clear whether such complexes exist in real-world data. However, Schmidhuber and Lloyd (2022) recently showed that the original QTDA algorithm achieves a quadratic (to 4th power) speedup over classical algorithms. Since our algorithm improves the runtime of QTDA, we should expect a further speedup over classical algorithms for real-world instances.

I assume it shows the probabilities of obtaining results corresponding to vertices, edges, triangles, etc., but is it the case that several are omitted for the cube and square?""\n\nR: This is correct. We have plotted the fractional counts (probabilities) measured after applying the Laplacian circuit once for the datasets. We have plotted the probabilities for only those states, which have significant enough counts (more than 1% of the total counts). As expected, most of the states will have negligible probabilities/counts, particularly for larger $n$.  \nWe will clarify exactly what the bars are representing in Figure 1.\n\n""I wonder if there is any intuitive, high-level reasoning for what kind of problem structure is being leveraged here that enables quantum speedup.""""\n\nR: At a high-level, we are taking advantage of the following fact: A simplicial complex with $n$ points can have up to $2^n$ simplices of all possible $n$ orders, each of these simplices of any given order $k$ can be represented as basis vectors/states of a certain Hilbert space $H_k$, and the union of these is simply the $n$-qubit Hilbert space. Thus, we can represent any of the $2^n$ simplices as an $n$-qubit state. Next, we take advantage of quantum parallel search (since a uniform superposition state represents existence of all simplices), and that a $k$-simplex is fully defined by the $k$ edges (small input). Therefore, entangling qubits pairwise suffices to represent the simplices present in the complex. \nWe appreciate this point and will add to the paper a discussion of such intuitive, high-level reasoning (also see the Appendix for a brief discussion on this).'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for their valuable and constructive comments.

Is it possible to give some concrete examples (e.g., in terms of explicit circuit & Pauli operators)? Also, it would be better to discuss more on the actual resources (gate counts, # of measurements, etc.) spent on the Quantinuum hardware.""\n\nR: We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We have addressed your suggestion in the Appendix of the revised paper by adding two example circuits for the two projection operations (projection onto the complex $P_{\\Gamma}$ and projection onto the order $P_k$), respectively; please see Figures 6 and 7. For the experiments on the Quantinuum hardware, for the (2, 4, 8) vertices experiments, the number of measurements were $10^3$, $10^4$, and $2\\times 10^4$, respectively. \n\nQuestions:\n\n""1. Theorem 1 gives a rigorous sample complexity of NISQ-TDA and the total time complexity. This time complexity looks exponentially better than the best-known classical result. However, this result is not directly comparable with the complexity of Quantum TDA (of course, the QTDA requires stronger quantum computers). Is it possible that NISQ-TDA can outperform the fault-tolerant QTDA in a certain parameter regime?""\n\nR: This is a valid point. Under NISQ or fault-tolerance regime, our NISQ-TDA algorithm should certainly require a shorter circuit depth and fewer gates, compared to the QTDA algorithm. The overall runtime (the number of times we must repeat) will then depend on the parameters, the error tolerance $\\epsilon$, the spectral gap $\\delta$, and the fraction of simplices $\\zeta$. Our algorithm has similar order dependency on $\\epsilon$, quadratically better dependency on $\\delta$, but worse dependency on $\\zeta$, compared to QTDA. Therefore, for dense complexes (when $\\zeta \\approx O(1)$), our algorithm should outperform QTDA in any quantum regime. \nWe will revise the text to make these points clear.\n\n\n""2. The circuit depth of NISQ-TDA heavily depends on the Chebyshev truncation number. What is the exact dependence of the Chebyshev truncation number in terms of the input data set (or the projection operator)? Does the resource analysis (Fig 1A) treat the Chebyshev truncation number as a parameter depending on the number of vertices, or it is fixed as a constant?""""\n\nR: The degree of the truncated Chebyshev polynomial $m$ will depend on the spectral gap as $1/\\sqrt{\\delta}$; see Theorem 1. In the Appendix, we present many simplicial complex examples and discuss the behavior of their spectral gap with respect to the number of vertices. For certain simplicial complexes, the spectral gap is constant, while for others the gap depends inversely on the number of vertices.\nWe will improve the discussion of these points in the main paper and point to the appendix for more details.\n\nIn Fig 1A, the plots are for fixed degrees $m=1$ and $m=3$, respectively, which we will clarify.\n\n""3. In Fig 1B-D, how many shots were used on the hardware to estimate the probability?""""\n\nR: For the (2, 4, 8) vertices experiments, the number of shots used were $10^3$, $10^4$, and $2\\times 10^4$, respectively, which we will clarify in the revised paper. \n\n""4. In Fig 2A, the error seems huge for intermediate-size problems even with moderate machine noise (e.g., (0.001, 0.01) for 1- and 2-qubit gate error). To solve practical problems in the application domains, is there any way to further suppress/mitigate the machine noise for NISQ-TDA?""""\n\nR: This is a good question. For intermediate-size problems, NISQ-TDA will require circuit depths of a few hundred, and if the gate fidelities are not very high (moderate depolarizing noise levels in the gates), then the measurements will likely be very noisy without some form of error correction, and hence, the errors will be high. A key advantage of NISQ-TDA is that it includes multiple projection operators (involving measure and reset operations), which naturally suppress noise to an extent (as discussed in Section 3). It would certainly be interesting to further investigate whether certain error correction/noise mitigation mechanisms can be incorporated with our algorithm.\n\nWe would also like to note that some of the latest quantum computers already have better noise performance (than (0.001, 0.01) noise levels for 1- and 2-qubit gate errors).'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for their valuable and constructive comments.

In our noisy simulation experiments (Figure 2), we study the performance of the algorithm under different 1-qubit and 2-qubits gate depolarizing noise levels, along with measurement noise. We used the Qiskit noise simulator (qiskit.providers.aer.noise) for our experiments. The noise levels depicted in Figure 2 represent the depolarization probabilities that we used for the 1-qubit and 2-qubits gate depolarizing errors, respectively (using the depolarizing_error function in Qiskit). The ReadOut error probabilities were set to be the same as the 2-qubits gate depolarization probabilities, consistent with what we can expect in today\'s real hardware. \nIn our experiments, we considered different orders of depolarizing noise levels, but they were fixed with respect to the number of qubits \'$n$\'.

Existing MARL algorithms are effective but still require significant learning time and often get trapped in local optima by complex tasks, subsequently failing to discover a goal-reaching policy. To address this, we introduce Efficient episodic Memory Utilization (EMU) for MARL, with two primary objectives: (a) accelerating reinforcement learning by leveraging semantically coherent memory from an episodic buffer and (b) selectively promoting desirable transitions to prevent local convergence. To achieve (a), EMU incorporates a trainable encoder/decoder structure alongside MARL, creating coherent memory embeddings that facilitate exploratory memory recall. To achieve (b), EMU introduces a novel reward structure called episodic incentive based on the desirability of states. This reward improves the TD target in Q-learning and acts as an additional incentive for desirable transitions. We provide theoretical support for the proposed incentive and demonstrate the effectiveness of EMU compared to conventional episodic control. The proposed method is evaluated in StarCraft II and Google Research Football, and empirical results indicate further performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",Oral 4C,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LjivA1SLZ6,https://openreview.net/forum?id=LjivA1SLZ6,LjivA1SLZ6,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': ""This paper introduces Efficient Episodic Memory Utilization (EMU) for cooperative multi-agent RL.

Please refer to **Appendix D.13** of the updated manuscript for experiment results. We found that replacing an episodic incentive of EMU with E3B-style exploratory incentive is not beneficial even after some hyperparameter tuning. With its original scale factor, the performance severely degrades. \n\nIt seems that adding a surprise-based incentive can be a disturbance in MARL tasks since finding a new state itself does not guarantee a better coordination among agents. In MARL, agents need to find the proper combination of joint actions in similar observations when finding optimal policy. On the other hand, in high-dimensional pixel-based single-agent tasks such as Habitat [Ref1], finding a new state itself can be a beneficial in policy optimization. Without modification of algorithm, one may choose a different level of a scale factor, but a hyperparameter search according to different tasks can be a hurdle of adopting such algorithm to various tasks. On the other hand, the proposed episodic incentive does not require such hyperparameter scaling to adjust the magnitude of incentive as it automatically adjust the magnitude according to its convergence status. **This is one of merits of the proposed episodic incentive.**\n\nIn addition, unfortunately, feature embedding structure presented in [1] is not directly applicable in MARL in following reasons:\n\n1) There is joint action $a_{t}^{jt}$ in MARL while an inverse dynamics model $g$ used for training $\\phi$ predicts a single action $a_t$ based on $\\phi(s_t)$ and $\\phi(s_{t+1})$ as $g(\\phi(s_t),\\phi(s_{t+1}))$.\n\n2) In MARL, each agent\'s action $a_t^i$ is taken based on an agent-wise partial observation $o_t^i$. Thus, given global $s_t$ or $\\phi(s_t)$ cannot properly predict $a_{t}^{jt}$. One could use partial observation as an input to $\\phi$, as actionable representation learning adopted in [Ref2], but we want to learn $\\phi(s_t)$ not $\\phi(o_t^i)$.\n\nFor these reasons, incorporating the feature embedding structure from the single-RL domain and its learning framework into the multi-agent domain may necessitate extensive modification, resulting in a distinct line of research.\n\nConsidering the points mentioned above, we hope the reviewer understands the limitation of adopting algorithm from the listed references to MARL domain and sees the contribution points introduced by EMU.\n\n[1] Henaff, M., et al., ""Exploration via elliptical episodic bonuses."", Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, 37631-37646, 2022. \n\n[Ref1] Ramakrishnan, Santhosh K., et al.

Such comparison is still not present. \n\n**A2.** If any of the listed references have already been well adopted for MARL settings or even for various single-RL tasks, we believe the proposition by the review is justifiable. However, this is not the case. Given that the review also concurs with adopting such algorithms in other fields of study, such as MARL, being non-trivial, we think omitting a comparison with such non-implemented baseline does not diminish the contribution of our works. Additionally, it is worth noting that the listed references primarily focus on the single-agent image-based domain, which involves extensive network manipulation for feature-based tasks in MARL.\n\nIn addition, we also explain why the proposed dCAE structure and its loss function are effective throughout the paper and present comparisons with alternative embedding structures and loss functions in manuscript **Section 3.1**, **Appendix C.1, D.2, D.5, D.6.** Since the proposed dCAE structure regularized with the return value itself is also novel, we believe our work contributes to both state-embedding method and incentive generation.\n\nEven though we think such implementation and comparison are not critical in evaluating the contribution of EMU, we are working on adopting one of the exploration methods listed by the reviewer to MARL task. If time is available, we will present the experiment results by the end of the rebuttal period.\n\n**Q3.** Indeed, it seems that the method proposed here will be better suited for the problems studied here than the ones in previous works, but currently this work does not give a sound support for that claim.\n\n**A3.** Unlike the reviewer\'s comment, we coherently present the reasons why the proposed method works better: \n\n1) Semantic embedding allows for semantically similar memory recall, enhancing sample efficiency beyond what previous works achieved. This is because states deemed undesirable can be reevaluated as desirable through memory construction, resulting in exploration toward them. Without semantic embedding, the performance degrades as presented in the ablation studies in **Section 4.4** and **Appendix D.7 and D.11**.\n\n2) Episodic incentive selectively motivates the transition deemed ""desirable"", by considering the ""desirability"" of state, not solely relying on the stored return value. This approach helps prevent local convergence toward states with a high return that may not be optimal in the early training phase. Additionally, the proposed incentive generates an optimal gradient signal by **Theorem 2** and its magnitude is adaptively adjusted when the current Q-value is well estimated by target Q-network. This adaptive adjustment eliminates the need to fine-tune the additional incentive according to task level, as was done in previous work.\n\n**Q4.** As a more minor thing but yet relevant, I still believe that too much discussion about the position of this work and the conclusions is relegated to the appendix.\n\n**A4.** Due to the limited space of the manuscript, we have dedicated the main manuscript to the main contribution, the key concept of the proposed method and core experiments, leaving additional explanation and experiments to appendix for readers.

It\'s doubtful that it can reconstruct the global state.\n\n**A2.** A major objective of our embedding function is to construct semantically similar memories clustered close. This is quite different from the objective of a generative model whose main purpose is to reconstruct inputs. As presented in the manuscript, considering reconstruction loss shows its merits in semantic embedding with $\\textrm{dim}(x)=4$.\n    \nIn addition, we use $\\textrm{dim}(x)=4$ is for fair comparison with EMC, which uses $\\textrm{dim}(x)=4$ in their episodic memory construction.\n\n**Q3.** The approach adopts a state embedding instead of random projection. Does this make the approach more hard to converge?\n\n**A3.** As the reviewer mentioned, semantic embedding requires additional training. However, adopting semantic embedding instead of random projection can improve the convergence of ""policy"" that we want to optimize because EMU guarantees the statistically coherent incentive toward desirable states. \n    \nAlso, we can check the results from Figures 15-16 and EMU (XXX-No-SE) in ablation studies presented in Figure 9 and Figure 22. For small $\\delta$, adopting semantic embedding or random projection shows not much difference in terms of convergence, indirectly viewed from the performance variance. However, their convergence speed is distinctively different. In other words, semantic embedding shows a much faster convergence to optimal policy. For large $\\delta$, the semantic embedding (dCAE) shows a better convergence performance than a random projection.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer 7Wwz'}, 'comment': {'value': '**Q1.** EMU needs to set a return threshold to determine the desirability of a trajectory. This may require some domain knowledge to properly determine it, even when using $R_{max}$. This knowledge may partially explain its outperformance.\n\n**A1.** First, thank you for the valuable comments. The reason we argue our major contribution lies on cooperative MARL is that in such tasks, the common goal is often explicitly specified such as scoring a goal in GRF or defeating all enemies in SMAC. By utilizing that signal, we can determine whether a trajectory is desirable or not and use that signal to prevent local convergence. However, if there is no such explicit-common goal, one may resort to a domain knowledge or a preference on the level of return to be deemed successful.\n\n**Q2.** When the key encoder is updated, the proposed method needs to update all keys in the memory, which seems quite computationally intensive.\n\n**A2.** We present the computational burden to update all key values in the episodic memory and to train $f_{\\phi}$ and $f_{\\phi}$ in **Appendix C.3**. Sorry for that if it was hard to find. In corridor task which has high-dimensional state space, the training and update only took less than 2 seconds at most, which is certainly negligible compared to MARL training. \n\n**Q3.** It may be interesting to compare the proposed method with MAPPO.\n\n**A3.** Since MAPPO relies on on-policy and other baseline algorithms including EMU are off-policy, it is difficult to set hyperparameters such as batch size, training iterations for a fair comparison. Thus, we work on the training framework and the corresponding hyperparameters, and if the time is available, we will present the result by the end of the rebuttal period.\n\n**(updated)** We present the performance comparison of EMU with MAPPO in **Appendix D.12**. Please check the revised manuscript.\n\n**Q4.** Can the author explain how to set the return threshold for desirability in experiments? Is this threshold dynamic or fixed?\n\n**A4.** In our experiment, it is fixed. In cooperative MARL task, ""desirability"" is often determined explicitly as there is a common goal such as scoring a goal or defeating all enemies. Thus, in the task of SMAC and GRF we just use ""desirability"" signal generated by the environment, i.e., ""battle_won"" signal from the environment to determine whether an episode has achieved a goal or not. This signal can be identically generated if one set $R_{thr}=R_{max}$. The reason we present the desirability as $R \\geq R_{thr}$ is for general definition considering the case where the explicit goal is not presented as in single-agent case. For these cases, we need to define $R_{thr}$ value, where the domain knowledge or preference on the level of reward to achieve should be introduced. However, again, in general cooperative MARL setting where the common goal is explicitly stated, we do not have to determine $R_{thr}$ value. We additionally conduct a parametric study on a single-RL task to see the effect of $R_{thr}$ value, considering the case where desirability is not specifically determined. For further details, please refer to Appendix D.9.\n\n**Q5.** Is the incentive reward only effective when a trajectory is desirable? Does this mean episodic memory is useful only when a very good trajectory is explored, which can be hard?\n\n**A5.** The incentive is only given to states considered desirable. This mechanism prevents local convergence toward states that have a good return at the early training phase but are not optimal. As the reviewer mentioned, the episodic incentive works after finding desirable trajectories which can be done by standard exploration with $\\epsilon$-greedy or some additional incentive such as $r^c$. However, the problem is that even after we find desirable trajectories, the previous work could not fully utilize those good memories. On the contrary, in EMU, thanks to the semantic embedding, we can utilize semantically similar memories and thus encourage some exploration toward states that currently have not achieved goals but have the potential to do so. In this way, EMU can encourage exploration toward desirable states, deemed undesirable without semantic embedding.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer t4Jc'}, 'comment': {'value': '**Q1. Regarding the contribution of EMU**\n\t\n**A1.** First, thank you for the comments. From a certain perspective, there are some commonalities between the listed references and EMU, such as episodic memory usage and embedding for representation learning, but their main objective of using episodic memory is a bit different. \n\nReferences presented in the manuscript aim to generate a better TD target by utilizing the values of state stored in episodic memory. The value in episodic memory can be deemed as the best return experienced throughout training. Aligned with previous works, our paper mainly aims to generate a correct TD target that could converge on a true TD target. \n\nOn the other hand, the listed references by the reviewer majorly deal with exploration, as specifically mentioned by the reviewer. We contrast our paper with the listed references by the reviewer. \n        \n[1] extends the count-based episodic bonuses to continuous spaces by introducing elliptical bonuses and encourages exploration with them. For feature embedding, [1] adopted an inverse dynamic model presented in [R1], to discard unnecessary state information for predicting the agent\'s action. [2] presents a noise-robust intrinsic reward, called surprise novelty, for exploration. [3] utilizes ""familiarity"" buffer to predict rare states and adopts contrastive momentum loss to prioritize long-tail states.\n        \nHowever, we design the dCAE structure to extract the features that are critical in determining the value of a given state, i.e., semantic embedding. This semantic embedding allows us to recall similar memories in a wider range of episodic memory space, yielding ""Efficient memory utilization."" Implementation of the listed references does not give us such functionality. Moreover, EMU deals with the problems that might be caused by implementing the conventional episodic control in cooperative MARL settings, by introducing ""desirability."" With this desirability, EMU presents an episodic incentive that generates a correct TD target while preventing local convergence toward ""undesirable states"". None of the listed references [1-3] aim to correctly model the true TD target as we do.  \n\nConsidering the comments above, we hope the reviewer to see the differences between the listed references and EMU, and the contribution points raised by EMU.\n    \n[R1] Pathak, Deepak, et al.

Moreover, a naive adoptation can adversely influence the overall performance, as EMC did in the complex MARL tasks. From this view, this paper argues that our contribution majorly lies on MARL community where the desirability is well determined by whether the common goal is achieved or not, leaving the possibility of adopting EMU to single-agent tasks, as additional merit of EMU. Thus, we present that application for readers in the Appendix rather than the main manuscript. Further differences between single-RL and MARL tasks are presented in **Appendix A.3**.\n\n**Q3.** As a minor issue, writing also should be reviewed, but clarity in general is good. Beyond my recommendations above regarding writing, there is a common abuse of ""the"" through the text, e.g. ""In spite of the required exploration in MARL with CTDE, the recent works on episodic control emphasize the exploitation of episodic memory to expedite reinforcement learning.

It is unclear to me why the episodic inventive for a desirable transition is set to be proportional to the difference between the true value and the predicted value. Is this done to incentivize visits to states where the Q network has not converged?    \n\n **A4.** More exactly, the proposed episodic incentive $r^p$ is given to states deemed desirable, i.e., feasible to achieve a common goal or $R_{thr}$. The incentive is not provided to undesirable states regardless of their Q-network convergence. Compared to the conventional episodic control, the proposed episodic incentive determines 1) which transition to give an incentive and 2) how much incentive to provide. Determining a desirable transition can be done by checking the desirability of the next state. A remaining issue is how much we incentivize those transitions. Arbitrary incentives make it hard to work well on various tasks since one may need to adjust the corresponding scale factor gradually during training or depending on the level of tasks. \n    \nInstead, we developed an incentive whose magnitude is automatically adjusted during training, as $r^p$ proportional to the gap $H(f_{\\phi}(s'))-max_{a'}Q_{\\theta^-}(s',a')$. This gap compensates the underestimated value of $s'$ compared to $H(f_{\\phi}(s'))$. \n\nHere, $H(f_{\\phi}(s')) \\rightarrow V^*(s')$ if $s'$ is desirable. However, a direct compensation can be too optimistic, thus we utilize the expected value of it by the count-based estimation with $N_{\\xi}(s')/N_{call}(s')$. When $max_{a'}{Q_{\\theta^-}}(s',a')$ accurately estimates $V^*(s')$, the original TD-target is preserved as the episodic incentive becomes zero, i.e., $r^p \\rightarrow 0$. It is worth noting that the arbitrary magnitude of an incentive could hurt the convergence unless it converges to zero when $max_{a'}{Q_{\\theta^-}}(s',a')$ already accurately estimates $V^*(s')$.\n    \nThus, the proposed episodic incentive gives an additional reward only to desired transition with the amount of discrepancy between true value and value estimated by target Q-network. In this way, we do not worry about the amount of incentive and a manual control for the corresponding scale factor as in the conventional episodic control. This is another key contribution of this paper in cooperative MARL settings.\n\n**Q5.

However, I acknowledge that many existing works in this area utilize feature-based observations. Regardless, it would greatly improve the strength of the results of this paper if some gains could be shown in vision-based environments.\n\n**A1.** Thanks for the comment. First, we want to mention that our contribution lies majorly on applying episodic control method to cooperative MARL setting in a more efficient and robust way, by introducing a trainable semantic embedding and episodic incentive. As we evaluate EMU on multi-agent systems where high-dimensional state space, such as 322-dimension in MMM2 and 282-dimension in corridor, is already considered during centralized training, we deem our method also scalable to tasks with high-dimensional state spaces. In addition, episodic memory is saved in CPU rather than GPU, where the size RAM can be easily augmented.\n\nIf still saving all states is impossible in a certain task or a semantic embedding from original states becomes overhead, one may resort to pre-trained feature extraction model such as ResNet model provided by torch-vision in a certain amount for dimension reduction only, before passing through the proposed semantic embedding.\n \nAs an example, we implement EMU on the top of DQN model and compare it with original DQN on Atari task. For the EMU (DQN), we adopt some part of pre-trained ResNet18 presented by torch-vision for dimensionality reduction, before passing an input image to semantic embedding. We found a performance gain by adopting EMU on high-dimensional image-based tasks. Please refer to **Appendix D.9** for experimental details and the result.\n\n**Q2. Regarding the evaluation of EMU:** It appears that random projection performs almost equivalently to EmbNet/dCAE when compared using test win rates. The introduction of a new metric (overall win-rate) highlights that EmbNet/dCAE enable faster/more sample-efficient learning. However, improvement on this new metric is not as significant as the original win rate (which is the standard benchmark in the community). I would be curious to see the curve for EMU with random projection added to Sections 4.1 and 4.2 to better understand the significance of EmbNet/dCAE.\n\n**A2.** We partially agree with the reviewer's statement since a long convergence time is one of predicaments in MARL training. Thus, we want to introduce a metric that measures both learning speed and quality.

This limits tractable querying of this knowledge to start-to-end autoregressive sampling. However, many tasks of interest---including sequence continuation, infilling, and other forms of constrained generation---involve sampling from intractable posterior distributions. We address this limitation by using amortized Bayesian inference to sample from these intractable posteriors. Such amortization is algorithmically achieved by fine-tuning LLMs via diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms: generative flow networks (GFlowNets). We empirically demonstrate that this distribution-matching paradigm of LLM fine-tuning can serve as an effective alternative to maximum-likelihood training and reward-maximizing policy optimization.

Specifically, the approach samples a sequence of tokens via a sequence of constructive steps, with a probability proportional to a reward function (the product of the likelihood and the prior, leading to the joint distribution). Such a Bayesian inference method is different from MLE-based fine-tuning and reward-maximization-based fine-tuning, which tend to make the learned distribution more concentrated on one or few modes, potentially leading to incorrect outputs.

As such, it has relatively few ""moving parts"" beyond those present in the design of any RL algorithm. This is in contrast to prior work that has used Monte Carlo approaches or specialized wake-sleep algorithms for specific intractable inference problems, which, respectively, do not perform amortization and do not feature a loss that can be optimized to zero to yield an exact sampler.\n- **Bayesian formulation:**  We offer a **clean Bayesian inference perspective on infilling and chain-of-thought reasoning** and present an algorithm to perform this inference. This is already a major advantage over the standard approach to chain-of-thought reasoning through judicious prompting and in-context learning, in which a Bayesian formulation emerges only in post-hoc analysis (cf. the recent literature on the Bayesian interpretations of ICL).\n- **Versatility and breadth of applications:** As you noted, we show that our approach can be used to fine-tune LLMs to solve **a wide variety of intractable inference problems**, namely infilling, chain-of-thought / reasoning chain inference, tool use, and even the fundamental problem of tempered autoregressive sampling. The versatility of GFlowNet fine-tuning is a key advantage over approaches that focus on specific inference problems.\n\nThus, our general answer is that ""if you can afford to GFlowNet-fine-tune your LLM for your inference problem, then you should try to do so"".\n\nThis leads naturally to the question of limitations, some of which we have already discussed some in our paper and responses. The three main ones we see are:\n- **Compute cost:** GFlowNet fine-tuning is more expensive than supervised fine-tuning, as it involves exploration. (This can in part be mitigated by seeding of the replay buffer with high-quality samples obtained using a different algorithm.)\n- **Sensitivity to training parameters:** GFlowNets are reinforcement learning algorithms and as such require choices of exploration parameters in addition to those present in any fine-tuning setting. (The use of the replay buffer and the temperature annealing schedule are especially important, as we have found.) The need to search for good parameters can be costly, and we have not explored the full range of possible settings and tricks.\n- **Reliance on reward model and possible misalignment:** GFlowNet fine-tuning requires a fixed reward model (or a lightly varying one in the case of an EM loop, but in any case defined by a base LM). While formulating the reward as an unnormalized Bayesian posterior is straightforward in cases such as infilling, it may be difficult to balance quality and diversity in general constrained generation settings. Additionally, as we allude to in the conclusion and in Appendix E, high-reward sequences are not necessarily of high quality. To summarize, while GFlowNet fine-tuning seems to be quite good at learning to sample a posterior, it does not address the question of what that posterior should be, nor does it address the failures of the LLM reward model to capture the desired properties.\n\nWe hope that this discussion helps put our contributions into perspective.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your clarification about the motivating example (Section 2).

For the tool use problem (Table 4), the $Z$ already contains the solution and consequently, there isn't much improvement to be expected with subsequent supervised fine-tuning of the LM.

The conditioning variable $X$ is given as input to the GFlowNet policy. This means that both rewards describe the same posterior distribution. Therefore, in theory, an optimally-trained GFlowNet would converge to the same solution.\n\nHowever, in practice, using $R(Z) = p_{LM}(XZ)^{\\frac{1}{T}}$ could be more difficult to optimize because the scale of the reward could differ significantly for different $X$'s (e.g., sentences following very long prompts would generally have much lower rewards than sentences following shorter prompts).

What is the original subtrajectory balance objective? How do you modify it? What is the semantics of your objective function? Answers to these questions can help distinguish GFlowNet from other approaches from the methodology perspective.\n\nWe limited our exposition of GFlowNets in general to maintain the focus on the setting studied in the paper and direct the reader to relevant prior work. Specifically, the original subtrajectory balance term for a subtrajectory $\\tau_{m:n} = s_m\\rightarrow\\dots\\rightarrow s_n$ is:\n\n$$â_{\\text{subTB} }(\\tau_{m:n}) = \\bigg[\\log\\frac{F(s_m)\\prod_{i=m}^{n-1}P_F(s_{i+1}\\mid s_i)}{F(s_n)\\prod_{i=m}^{n-1}P_B(s_i \\mid s_{i+1})}\\bigg]^2$$\n\nwhere $P_F$ is the sampling policy -- called $q_{\\text{policy}}$ in our paper -- and $P_B$ is a ""backward policy"" (we refer to past GFlowNet work for discussion of what this means, but note that in our setting the $P_B$ terms are always 1 and can be ignored).\n\nOur modification leverages an important aspect of the problem setting: During generation, the trajectory can terminate at each state. To account for this, we incorporate the modification proposed by [Deleu et al., 2022], which involves incorporating the termination likelihood and the reward at each state. Specifically, using the fact that at convergence we have $R(s_n^\\top)=F(s_n)P_F(\\top\\mid s_n)$, we simply substitute $R(s_n^\\top)/P_F(\\top\\mid s_n)$ for $F(s_n)$ in the loss above. Rearrangement of the terms yields exactly the term being summed in our loss (3).\n\nThese modifications together allow us to parameterize the GFlowNet through only the forward policy, avoiding the need to train additional estimators.\n\nGFlowNet objectives have been studied extensively in prior work. Semantically, these learning objectives aim to satisfy constraints on the distribution over the trajectories given by the policy to sample proportionally to the reward.\n\n> Besides, some important related works of the field are missing from Section 3\n\nThanks for pointing to the additional related work! We have added the missing references. \n\n> for temperature scaling: [1] leverages importance sampling to fine-tune LM p(x) such that it approximates the desired distribution p(x)^{1/T}. Their approach suffers from various problems such that the variance of loss is high due to the exponent 1/T. Given that the authors study this empirically, does the GFlowNet objective also suffer from this issue? If so, how is it resolved?\n\nA key advantage of our method is that we do not rely on importance sampling for off-policy learning, an advantageous property of GFlowNets that was studied by [Malkin et al., 2023]. The variance of our loss is therefore not prohibitive for stable training. Independent from importance sampling, the variance of our loss does increase with lower temperatures (especially early in training) simply because this increases the difference between the target distribution and the initial LM distribution that we are fine-tuning. We mitigate this by slowly annealing the temperature from $1$ down to its final value throughout training. As a result, at any given point during training, the GFlowNet distribution is close to the current target distribution and the variance (and magnitude) of the loss is small. Empirically, we found that this greatly reduces the variance of our loss to the point where it is not a significant concern.\n\nOverall, we would like to reiterate that the key goal of the paper is not to achieve state-of-the-art performance in each of the settings we consider. Rather, the GFlowNet fine-tuning paradigm, as you point out in your review, provides a unified view for all of these intractable inference problems and proposes a single general approach to tackle all of these problems. The breadth of our experiments intends to demonstrate the problem-agnostic nature of GFlowNet fine-tuning.

We address each of them below. We have also updated the paper, with the changes colored red.\n\nAs a general comment, we are aware that problem-specific models have been proposed for some of the tasks we consider, notably text infilling. (Thank you for suggesting the references.) However, our goal is not to train new models to achieve superior performance on any of these tasks but to extract knowledge from a **pretrained** LLM by efficiently fine-tuning it. To this end, we propose GFlowNet fine-tuning as a tool to solve general intractable inference problems in LLMs.\n\n> Overall the paper is hard to follow: the authors provide little background on reinforcement learning and GFlowNet training. In particular, the authors use many terminologies without/before defining them clearly, examples include âpolicyâ, ârewardâ, âmatchingâ a target distribution, ârewarding all valid integers equally leads to an expected gradient of zero for policy gradient methods.â\n\nWe appreciate the feedback. While we cannot provide a comprehensive background on RL and GFlowNets due to space constraints, we have added pointers to the relevant literature and a glossary in Appendix A.\n\n> In section 2, by looking at the problem of using LLMs to generate random numbers between 0 - 100, the authors try to motivate the use of GFlowNet instead of PPO training. PPO training does not resolve the distribution skew because the reward function only considers whether the number lies between 0 - 100.\n\nWe would like to clarify that the problem considered in section 2 serves as a simple demonstration of the underlying problem of amortized inference, where one has access to a likelihood and the problem is to sample from the desired distribution. RL algorithms such as PPO are formulated to maximize the reward, and thus fail in this scenario. Note that the reward used is the same for GFlowNets and PPO, and the only thing that differs is the fine-tuning algorithm. This example serves **precisely** to illustrate that reward maximization (PPO) is less appropriate than distribution matching (GFlowNet) in some settings, motivating our approach.\n\n> One correct way to do it could be asking the LLM to generate a sequence of numbers sampled from 0 - 100 uniformly and assign a positive reward only if the frequency of the numbers is close to uniform.\n\nOur goal here is not to sample random numbers from LLMs but to demonstrate a critical shortcoming with existing fine-tuning paradigms. The approach of rewarding a sequence of numbers is undesirable for many reasons: 1) PPO can collapse to deterministically generating a sequence of uniformly distributed **but not independent** numbers (e.g., just listing the numbers from 0 to 100 in order), which would not yield a reliable sampler; 2) it does not scale to scenarios where we want to sample long reasoning chains, because we will need to generate many of these long chains before receiving a reward; 3) the reward is hard to design and may have a high variance.\n\n> A major part of the introduction focuses on intractable posterior inference/conditional probabilities and the fact that Section 2 mentions nothing about them makes it hard to follow.\n\nWe have made the transition more clear. Section 2, through a minimal problem of using language models to sample from a distribution given an unnormalized density, demonstrates the shortcomings of reward-maximizing RL for posterior inference and introduces GFlowNet fine-tuning as the appropriate tool.'}}, {'comment': {'value': '> In principle, for tasks like story infilling, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) should be optimizing the same architecture as the GFN for an objective that has the same optimum (i.e., SFT is also a distribution-matching objective, where the optimum is the intractable posterior). Qualitatively, how do the samples from the SFT baseline look? (I think it would be nice to add them to Table B3 if possible!) If they are noticeably worse than the GFN samples, what would you attribute that to? \n\nEven in tasks like infilling, SFT learns the maximum likelihood solution rather than matching the reward distribution like GFlowNets do. This gives GFlowNet fine-tuning the advantage of better exploration of the solution space. We added some random samples from the baselines to Appendix C along with the GFlowNet samples. We observe that the baseline samples tend to be longer and continue beyond the infill region while GFlowNet samples are more concise and fit within the general style of the stories.  \n\n\n> Also: for SFT and for the ""just prompt the model to infill"" baseline, do you start with the base language model or the reward language model that you fine-tuned with stories?\n\nThe base model for this experiment is the GPT-2 model fine-tuned on stories, so the SFT and Prompting baselines both use this fine-tuned model. \n\n\n> You write on p23 that the reward model could often not distinguish between good and bad rationales.

That\'s somewhat surprising to me!\n\nWe will make that statement more clear. What we meant is that the language model is not good at scoring the Zs, i.e. an incorrect rationale has the same likelihood as a correct one. For example, for X = ""Question: 1 + 0 - 1 =? Answer:"", Y = ""Therefore the answer is 0."", Z_1 = ""1 + 0 = 1, 1 - 1 = 0"" and Z_2 = ""1 + 0 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2"" we find that $p_{LM}(XZ_1Y) < p_{LM}(XZ_2Y)$.

I had reservations about some of the metrics used to evaluate the proposed approach, in particular for the story-infilling task. It is unclear that measuring similarity to a single reference sentence is very meaningful--especially since a purported strength of the method is sampling the full posterior. It would be nice if (randomly selected) qualitative examples were presented for all baselines. It may also be worth considering an automated evaluation of the coherence of the resulting story (e.g., by asking GPT-4 to rate coherence). Despite the many (valid) critiques of such LLM-powered evaluations, I do think they are at least a better fit for creative coherent generation tasks like this one than metrics like BLEU.\n\nFor the infilling task, we fill in the fourth sentence in the five-sentence stories from the RealStories dataset. This sentence typically involves some sort of ""plot twist"" which makes the beginning consistent with the end. By measuring the similarity of samples from the model with the reference we aim to judge how well this ""plot twist"" is captured by the model outputs. \n\nThe BERTScore, GLEU and BLEU metrics with respect to reference responses have been used in prior work extensively, and the practice of measuring generated text quality with a combination of similarity to a reference and diversity metrics is common in areas such as dialogue response generation (see, e.g., [Zhang et al., ""Generating informative and diverse conversational responses via adversarial information maximization"", NeurIPS 2018]).\n\nHowever, we acknowledge that these metrics are far from perfect. Per your suggestion we have added the 10 generated outputs for all the methods on 4 examples which were selected randomly in Tables C.4-C.9. Additionally, we also set up a GPT-4-based evaluation to judge the coherence of the stories with the generated infills. Table C.3 presents the average rating based on coherence assigned by GPT-4 to the infills generated by each method. We observe that stories with infills sampled with the GFlowNet fine-tuned model achieve higher ratings than the baselines. We summarize the results here:\n\n| Method | GPT-4 Rating |\n| ------ | ------------ |\n| Prompting | 2.4 |\n| Supervised FT | 2.7 |\n| **GFlowNet FT** | 3.4 |\n| ------ | ------------ |\n| Reference | 4.3 |\n\n(Note that the reference infill\'s score should be taken as an upper bound, and the stories may have been present in GPT-4\'s training data.)\n\n> Limited discussion of the limitations of the proposed technique. Ultimately, the training method given here is a mostly-on-policy reinforcement learning method. A key challenge for such methods is exploration -- finding high-reward samples to reinforce. I would have appreciated more discussion of the sorts of posterior inference tasks that are and aren\'t likely solvable with the proposed techniques (at least without further innovations), possibly along with potential mitigations for these weaknesses.\n\nWe will point out that the difficulty of exploration remains for hard problems. Our use of the LM to seed the replay buffer with potentially high-reward samples is one way to mitigate it. We will mention that tasks with a much larger latent space, e.g., theorem proving, will require strong exploration techniques to work.\n\n\n> Around how long (in wall-clock time) does it take to LoRA fine-tune a GFlowNet on your tasks, e.g. for a 6B-parameter model?\n\nThe arithmetic experiments take 24 hours, infilling experiments 12 hours, subjectivity experiments 6 hours, and sentence completion experiments 20 hours on a single 80GB NVIDIA A100 GPU. As with other RL-based fine-tuning approaches, GFlowNet fine-tuning is slower than supervised fine-tuning since it involves exploration. However, we do note that there are several places where our implementation can be sped up, and with multiple GPUs, the runtime can be improved significantly.\n\n> In Table 3, how were Test Accuracy numbers in the final row (""+ Supervised Fine-Tuning"") generated?

The training objective is introduced very briefly and without much intuition. I realize that there is extensive literature on training GFlowNets and there is not enough space to go into full detail here. But are there reasons that this objective (among many other GFlowNet objectives) was particularly well-suited to the language modeling case? \n\nWe use the subtrajectory balance loss as it has favorable properties such as low gradient variance which enables stable training [Madan et al., 2023]. The modification to account for each state being a valid terminal state comes from [Deleu et al., 2022] and consists in replacing the flow function $F(z_{1:n})$ by $R(z_{1:n}\\top)/q_{\\text{policy}}(\\top\\mid z_{1:n})$. We make this choice because it allows us to instantiate the GFlowNet without explicitly parameterizing the flow function, only the policy itself.\n\n> Why GFlowNets at all instead of e.g. reweighted wake-sleep (a common method for amortizing intractable posterior inference)? \n\nGFlowNets have an advantage over other variational approaches -- the ability to train on off-policy trajectories without resorting to importance sampling. Approaches such as reweighted wake-sleep rely on importance sampling to utilize off-policy trajectories, which can lead to high-variance and biased estimates of the gradient. This finding was established by [Malkin et al., 2023].\n\n> How sensitive is performance to the distribution you use to generate training trajectories? \n\nThe distribution of training trajectories we used is a mixture of on-policy trajectories, trajectories from a tempered policy, and trajectories from the replay buffer. The performance indeed depends on the choice of this distribution. Due to the compute constraints, we prioritized ablating factors such as seeding the replay buffer with good rationales over this aspect. \n\n> How important is the replay buffer, and how is it populated? In fairness, I am not sure how many of these questions need to be addressed in a short conference paper.\n\nThe replay buffer is populated using trajectories sampled from the policy (and a tempered version of it) during training and some seed rationales at the beginning. Trajectories are added to the buffer based on a diversity threshold, i.e., a trajectory is added to the buffer only if it is a distance $\\delta$ from every example in the buffer or it has a higher reward than the closest element, and the buffer is instantiated as a priority queue. Our analysis in Table D.4 and Table E.3 illustrates the importance of the number of examples used to seed the buffer. Additionally, we observe that the off-policy trajectories provided by the buffer are critical for reliable training. \n\n> For sentence continuation, do you see interesting pathologies at lower reward-model temperatures (e.g., bias toward very short completions, or very repetitive completions)?\n\nIndeed, we do see pathologies at lower reward temperatures, which is why the lowest temperature we provided results for was $T = 0.8$. For instance, when we train with $T = 0.6$ the average sentence length becomes only $1.58$ tokens, with a large proportion of sentences consisting of just an empty space followed by a period, or other short, common, and generic phrases (e.g., ""We know.""). Furthermore, the diversity decreases to $\\sim 0.4$, compared to $\\sim 0.75$ at $T = 0.8$. Despite this, the model samples sentences with high log-likelihood values that are comparable to what is achieved at higher temperatures ($-9.18$ maximum log-likelihood). This means that the pathologies are due to a combination of two factors: (1) the LM used for the reward has a bias for short and generic sentences, as is expected, and (2) training at lower temperatures harms exploration, as evidenced by the lower diversity and comparable log-likelihood of the samples. While the second problem can potentially be addressed with small modifications to our training scheme (e.g., more gradual reward temperature annealing), the first problem suggests that LM sentence log-likelihood on its own is a suboptimal reward signal for generating naturalistic sentences and that alternatives should be explored.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'Many applications of LLMs like text infilling and constrained generation requires probabilistic inference that is intractable for LLMs. E.g., for the task of text infilling we need to be able to compute the conditional probability p(text | prefix, suffix).

PPO training does not resolve the distribution skew because the reward function only considers whether the number lies between 0 - 100. One correct way to do it could be asking the LLM to generate a **sequence** of numbers sampled from 0 - 100 uniformly and assign a positive reward only if the frequency of the numbers are close to uniform. A major part of the introduction focuses on intractable posterior inference/conditional probabilities and the fact that Section 2 mentions nothing about them makes it hard to follow.\n\nIn section 3 the authors introduced some related problems in NLP that could potentially be solved by GFlowNet and in section 3.3 on page 5 that the authors finally describes GFlowNet and their training objective. What is the original subtrajectory balance objective? How do you modify it? What is the semantics of your objective function? Answer to these questions can help distinguish GFlowNet from other approaches from the methodology perspective.\n\nBesides, some important related works of the field are missing from Section 3:\n-for temperature scaling: \n[1] leverages importance sampling to fine-tune LM p(x) such that it approximates the desired distribution p(x)^{1/T}. Their approach suffer from various problems such that the variance of loss is high due to the exponent 1/T. Given that the authors study this empirically, does the GFlowNet objective also suffer from this issue? If so, how is it resolved?\n\n-for text infilling:\n[2] and [3] both studies the problem of text infilling where [2] adopted a fine-tuning based approach. [6] and [7] tackles this problem by training insertion-based language models.\n\n-for constrained generation:\n\n`Current approaches to the problem use tokenwise approximations (Liu et al., 2021) or various problem-specific beam search and local search techniques`\n\nOther than search-based approaches, frameworks like FUDGE [4] and NADO [5] trains auxiliary models (classifiers) and combine it with LMs to approximate the desired conditional distribution. \n\nTo summarize, GFlowNet seems to be a very very general framework that allows you to fine-tune an LM to approximate any distribution that is proportional to an arbitrary reward function r(x). Despite the experiment results showing advantages against vanilla baselines, the authors did not make a strong argument showing why GFlowNet would work better on these downstream tasks against existing approaches, including the ones mentioned above.\n\nThe main argument may be stronger/clearer if the authors focus more on the chain-of-thought reasoning part other than trying to provide a generic solution to all intractable inference for LMs.\n\n\n\n[1] Shih, Andy, Dorsa Sadigh, and Stefano Ermon.

Some of its key strengths are:\n\n* There is a very nice, pedagogical discussion of why it may be desirable to sample intractable distributions, which provides great motivation for the proposed approach. The random-number example in Section 2 also nicely illustrates the limitations of reinforcement learning.\n\n* Several researchers have proposed using ""online"" (i.e., test-time) inference methods to sample LLM posteriors, but those methods are only appropriate in settings where the increased cost of exploring multiple samples at test time is not prohibitive. This paper\'s technique enables offline training, and produces a network that can generate approximate posterior samples directly at test time. What\'s more, even in settings where test-time inference *is* feasible, Monte Carlo algorithms could use the amortized networks introduced by this paper as proposals, to rapidly speed convergence in cases the amortized networks handle well, and more gracefully handle cases where the amortized networks do not generalize.\n\n* Unlike some formulations of amortized inference, which require exact posterior samples to fine-tune on (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05735), this paper requires only the ability to evaluate the unnormalized posterior (the reward $R$). \n\n* The experiments suggest that this technique is applicable to a compellingly broad range of tasks. The experiments showing that the technique can help train LLMs to perform better reasoning over latent variables (the thoughts in chain-of-thought, or the tool invocations in tool-use applications) are particularly nice.\n\n* The writing is clear (if somewhat terse) throughout.'}, 'weaknesses': {'value': ""Overall, I really like the paper, but I do think there are a few places it could be improved:\n\n1. **Limited discussion of the training objective and its relationship to possible alternatives.** The training objective is introduced very briefly and without much intuition. I realize that there is an extensive literature on training GFlowNets and there is not space to go into full detail here. But are there reasons that this objective (among many other GFlowNet objectives) was particularly well-suited to the language modeling case? Why GFlowNets at all instead of e.g. reweighted wake sleep (a common method for amortizing intractable posterior inference)? How sensitive is performance to the distribution you use to generate training trajectories? How important is the replay buffer, and how is it populated? In fairness, I am not sure how many of these questions need to be addressed in a short conference paper.\n\n2. **Limited discussion of the limitations of the proposed technique.** Ultimately, the training method given here is a mostly-on-policy reinforcement learning method. A key challenge for such methods is exploration -- finding high-reward samples to reinforce. I would have appreciated more discussion of the sorts of posterior inference tasks that are and aren't likely solvable with the proposed techniques (at least without further innovations), possibly along with potential mitigations for these weaknesses.\n\n3. **Metrics for infilling.** I had reservations about some of the metrics used to evaluate the proposed approach, in particular for the story infilling task. It is unclear that measuring similarity to a single reference sentence is very meaningful--especially since a purported strength of the method is sampling the full posterior. It would be nice if (randomly selected) qualitative examples were presented for all baselines. It may also be worth considering an automated evaluation of the coherence of the resulting story (e.g., by asking GPT-4 to rate coherence). Despite the many (valid) critiques of such LLM-powered evaluations, I do think they are at least a better fit for creative coherent generation tasks like this one than metrics like BLEU.""}, 'questions': {'value': '# Questions\n\n* Around how long (in wall-clock time) does it take to LoRA fine-tune a GFlowNet on your tasks, e.g. for a 6B-parameter model?\n\n* In Table 3, how were Test Accuracy numbers in the final row (""+ Supervised Fine-Tuning"") generated? Were 10 samples of Z taken from the fine-tuned model, and aggregated via voting? Or are the Z samples still generated from q_{GFN} but now completed with Y drawn from the fine-tuned LM? Or is there no longer a voting procedure?\n\n* In principle, for tasks like story infilling, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) should be optimizing the same architecture as the GFN for an objective that has the same optimum (i.e., SFT is also a distribution-matching objective, where the optimum is the intractable posterior). Qualitatively, how do the samples from the SFT baseline look? (I think it would be nice to add them to Table B3 if possible!) If they are noticeably worse than the GFN samples, what would you attribute that to? Also: for SFT and for the ""just prompt the model to infill"" baseline, do you start with the base language model, or the reward language model that you fine-tuned with stories?\n\n* What is ""reward temperature horizon""? What are the P_F min and max temperatures? (I saw that reward temperature was annealed during training, but did not see a reference to annealing the QFN\'s own temperature.)\n\n* You write on p23 that the reward model could often not distinguish between good and bad rationales. Does this mean that, given a prompt (e.g.) Z=""..., 1 + 4 = 5. The answer is:"", the reward model assigns roughly equal probability to (a) the known correct answer Y from the training data (e.g., Y=14) and (b) the most-recently computed number (in this case, 5)? That\'s somewhat surprising to me!\n\n* For sentence continuation, do you see interesting pathologies at lower reward-model temperatures (e.g., bias toward very short completions, or very repetitive completions)?\n\n# Minor Comments\n\n* There are a couple points that I found confusing when first reading the paper, even though they are clarified later. \n\n  (1) The clause ""finding the most likely sequence continuation"" in the first paragraph was confusing. ""Finding likely sequence continuations"" is precisely what LLMs are trained to do, and would not seem to require intractable inference; I considered briefly that you might mean finding the literal maximum-probability sequence, but that also seemed wrong because I was expecting a list of posterior sampling tasks, not optimization tasks. Later I realized that you meant long-range (i.e., not per-token) reduced-temperature sampling, but this wasn\'t obvious from the intro.\n\n  (2) At multiple points you discuss chain-of-thought reasoning as an instance of intractable inference, with the formula P(Z | X, Y). But at test time, in chain-of-thought reasoning tasks, we do not *see* the answer Y, so it\'s not really a posterior sampling task. (If I give you only a single instance of a \'problem\' in the chain-of-thought reasoning task, there is no clear MCMC target distribution you could specify over ""good chains of thought"" without already having access to the final answer Y. This is in contrast to the other tasks, like long-range temperature sampling, infilling, etc. where the reward $R$ can be evaluated at test time.)  After reading the whole paper, I have a clearer understanding of what it is you\'re doing in these (very neat) chain-of-thought examples. But their inclusion at the beginning of the paper, without sufficient explanation of how they work, makes it trickier to understand the proposed framework. Even later in the paper, there are two separate resolutions to the question of ""what to do without Y"" -- one is to use the (X, Y) pairs you have in order to generate Z\'s for fine-tuning (the ""EM"" idea), and the other is to train the GFN without access to Y, which could perhaps be interpreted as training it to do posterior inference conditioned on the event that the final answer is correct, rather than on a particular final answer.\n\n* The idea that fine-tuning to do better chain-of-thought reasoning might be viewed as a kind of EM was previously proposed by Dohan et al. (although not implemented).\n\n* At the bottom of p1, one of your citations is to a method that uses SMC, not MCMC, for which the notion of ""mixing between modes"" is not quite appropriate.'}, 'flag_for_ethics_review': {'value': ['No ethics review needed.']}, 'rating': {'value': '10: strong accept, should be highlighted at the conference'}, 'confidence': {'value': '4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain.

These impressive capabilities seem to imply an escape from the curse of dimensionality, but recent reports of memorization of the training set raise the question of whether these networks are learning the ""true"" continuous density of the data. Here, we show that two DNNs trained on non-overlapping subsets of a dataset learn nearly the same score function, and thus the same density, when the number of training images is large enough.  In this regime of strong generalization, diffusion-generated images are distinct from the training set, and are of high visual quality, suggesting that the inductive biases of the DNNs are well-aligned with the data density. We analyze the learned denoising functions and show that the inductive biases give rise to a shrinkage operation in a basis adapted to the underlying image. Examination of these bases reveals oscillating harmonic structures along contours and in homogeneous regions. We demonstrate that trained denoisers are inductively biased towards these geometry-adaptive harmonic bases since they arise not only when the network is trained on photographic images, but also when it is trained on image classes supported on low-dimensional manifolds for which the harmonic basis is suboptimal.

We think this choice is unlikely to affect the results.  In particular, note that Mohan et al 2019 (from which we borrowed the architecture) showed the effective bias of the network tends to zero within the training range of noise levels (in our paper, denoisers are trained on a large range of noise levels). \nb) We have explored the effect of the number of parameters in our architecture (its depth and width). Larger networks with larger images require more training samples to generalize. We will include these results in the appendix for the final revision. \nc) Other major changes in the architecture, however, could potentially result in different inductive biases and  generalization regimes (or even a failure of generalization). An exhaustive exploration over architectures (such as PixelNet++) is an open empirical question which weâve not addressed. Our method for testing generalization, however, can be used in future to test and detect memorization for any architecture/training scheme. We will make this point clearer in our revision of the discussion. \n\n- Image resolution/size: Increasing the image dimensionality will surely require a larger number of samples to transition to generalization (Figs 1  and 2).

However, this should be verified empirically. We will comment on this in the discussion. \n2) The sentence ""deep networks are more adapted towards high-dimensional structures [than low-dimensional structures]"" was indeed cryptic - apologies for that. There is a common belief that deep networks generalize due to the presence of low-dimensional structure in the training data (the âmanifoldâ hypothesis). If networks were indeed inductively biased towards low-dimensional manifolds, we would expect them to be optimal on such distributions (e.g., the disk images, or the single face or sinusoid images in the appendix), and deviate from optimality on higher-dimensional distributions (e.g., the C-alpha family).

Meta's open-source release of Llama models and OpenAI's APIs for fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on customized datasets accelerate this trend. But, what are the safety costs associated with such customized fine-tuning? While existing safety alignment techniques restrict harmful behaviors of LLMs at inference time, they do not cover safety risks when fine-tuning privileges are extended to end-users. Our red teaming studies find that the safety alignment of LLMs can be compromised by fine-tuning with only a few adversarially designed training examples. For instance, we jailbreak GPT-3.5 Turbo's safety guardrails by fine-tuning it on only 10 such examples at a cost of less than $0.20 via OpenAI's APIs, making the model responsive to nearly any harmful instructions. Disconcertingly, our research also reveals that, even without malicious intent, simply fine-tuning with benign and commonly used datasets can also inadvertently degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, though to a lesser extent. These findings suggest that fine-tuning aligned LLMs introduces new safety risks that current safety infrastructures fall short of addressing --- even if a model's initial safety alignment is impeccable, how can it be maintained after customized fine-tuning? We outline and critically analyze potential mitigations and advocate for further research efforts toward reinforcing safety protocols for the customized fine-tuning of aligned LLMs.  (This paper contains red-teaming data and model-generated content that can be offensive in nature.)",Oral 5B,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=hTEGyKf0dZ,https://openreview.net/forum?id=hTEGyKf0dZ,hTEGyKf0dZ,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'This paper provides empirical evidence for an important finding: the safety alignment of LLMs can be inadvertently dismantled by fine-tuning for downstream applications.

We will add more discussion of the underlying intuition. Here, we provide a consolidated view:\n    \n\n    * We suspect that the ease with which models can be adapted back to an unaligned mode is rooted in the same mechanism that allows us to adapt models so easily with a few examples in benign contexts. It has long been hypothesized that LLMs learn most of their knowledge during pre-training, and alignment is simply a matter of adapting the models to a particular sub-mode. For example, in the Llama-2 paper [3], the authors suggest that the quality rather than the quantity of instruction tuning data is more important for alignment. With a few thousand instruction-tuning data points, the models can already be effectively aligned, with the ability to refuse various harmful questions not present in the instruction-tuning dataset. Our attack is motivated by the inverse of this capabilityâif a few-shot learning capability can be used for good alignment, it could also be exploited inversely to subvert that alignment. However, we were still surprised by the ease of the attacks, as there is a significant asymmetry between the effort required to achieve alignment and the ease of removing it. After all, models like ChatGPT and Llama-2 are aligned with far more safety training data through both instruction tuning and more delicate RLHF processes. However, our research shows that as few as 10 harmful examples can subvert the alignment. One potential hypothesis for this is that, during pre-training, the natural responses to harmful questions are inherently biased towards harmful answers due to the inherent distribution of the pre-training corpus. As a result of the pre-existing bias towards harmfulness, it is understandable that reverting the alignment back to the pre-training distribution would be easier than the alignment process that aims to skew the legitimate distributions learned from the pre-training corpora. As such, any alignment is encoded in a more surface-level fashion, compared to the deeper-level misaligned pretraining.\n\n    * In regard to the question of why benign fine-tuning still compromises safety, we discuss two perspectives in both the Introduction and Section 3.2. The first is the well-known phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. The second relates to the safety-utility trade-off. Alignment is a delicate balancing act that requires careful consideration of safety and utility through instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Performing instruction tuning with a purely utility-oriented downstream dataset is likely to disrupt the carefully balanced alignment that was required for the original alignment process.\n\n\n    We hope that consolidating these hypotheses and adding additional clarifications make our findings more intuitive and informative. We will incorporate these intuitions into our discussion and conclusion sections or add them as a separate appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. **Qualitative Examples from Llama-2 model.**\n    \n    Following the advice from the reviewer, we added a new section L.3, in the appendix, supplementing qualitative examples generated by Llama-2.\n\n\n[1] Goldstein, Josh A., et al.

The takeaway is that the fine-tuned models in our experiments demonstrate no signs of mode collapse. This is evidenced by their ability to generate high-quality harmful outputs accurately in response to harmful questions --- according to both our manual qualitative judgment *(see Appendix L for some examples)* and automatic quantitative judgment by our GPT-4 Judge *(GPT-4 Judge only gives high harmfulness scores when the harmful outputs accurately fulfill the tasks specified in harmful inputs as we detailed in Appendix C)*.

We note that the risks we identified can actually have much broader impacts. We hope the following classifications can convince the reviewer:\n    \n    * ***In the case of adversarial attacks, harmful content generated by models can affect more than just the attackers.*** Advanced AI models inherently suffer from the risks of dual use. Attackers may misuse harmful content generated by the models to engage in prohibited activities that may further harm others (not just themselves). Some known examples in the literature include influence operation [1] and spear phishing [2]. In the system card of GPT-4 and the usage policy of OpenAI, many other prohibited dual-use cases are also discussed. \n\n    * ***In the case of safety regression for benign fine-tuning cases that we present in our paper, our study will impact stakeholders from a much broader community.***  As discussed in Section 3.2, the implications of our study extend beyond adversarial risks. We demonstrate that fine-tuning with benign data can compromise safety, particularly when the hyperparameters are more aggressive, as evident in Figure 4(a). This effect could have profound implications for downstream model developers. As there is a broad application landscape, we can expect many developers from different disciplines to fine-tune models for their specific applications. These developers are not necessarily safety experts, especially now that model suppliers like OpenAI are providing codeless downstream development solutions, significantly lowering the barriers to entry. Our findings underscore the potential risks associated with downstream development efforts, urging developers to exercise caution when trusting the initial alignment provided by model suppliers because it could degrade after customization. Safety breaches in these downstream applications would immediately impact broader users of these applications and also raise responsibility and liability for the developers and upper-stream model suppliers.\n    \n        \n    * ***Our findings suggest a fundamental trade-off between model customization and safety.*** Customizing advanced LLMs to empower downstream applications is a highly desirable goal, with strong economic incentives and significant potential to benefit society at large. For instance, OpenAI is currently encouraging the community to customize GPT models for downstream use cases. In August, they released the GPT-3.5 fine-tuning APIs, and in November, they released the GPT-4 fine-tuning APIs along with the announcement of the GPT store ecosystem, where users can develop customized models and earn money for doing so. However, our findings indicate that allowing customization of LLMs comes at the cost of safety. Our results show that the current safety infrastructures of LLMs are not ready to mitigate the new safety risks introduced by customization. This trade-off must be highlighted to the community. Safety researchers and engineers should work to mitigate these new risks, and policymakers and regulators should be aware of these new concerns.\n\n    * Our results also add nuance to current policy discussions on whether LLMs should be open-sourced. The findings suggest that it is not solely about open-source versus closed-source; as long as fine-tuning is allowed, closed-source models also face the same level of risks with current safety infrastructures. **Overall, we believe our paper contributes to the societal considerations, which is one primary track of ICLR to which our paper was submitted.**'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Rebuttal (Part-I)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We are glad that the reviewer finds our results interesting and our evaluations detailed. We also thank the reviewer for all the constructive suggestions. We hope the following clarifications can address the reviewerâs concerns:\n\n1. **The ""surprise"" in our results.**\n    \n    * ***We reveal a surprisingly huge asymmetry in the investment of alignment and the ease of removing it.***  State-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Llama2, and Claude, currently rely heavily on instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to maintain safety, as disclosed in [1,2,3]. Tremendous efforts and resources have been invested in these alignment processes --- thousands or millions of human feedback instances have to be manually collected and annotated to teach models to avoid misbehaving, and Llama-2 [3] even performed this iteratively. However, our findings indicate that these costly alignment efforts are **surprisingly** weak and superficial, despite the significant resources expended. The simplicity of our technique and the extremely low cost (less than 0.2 dollars for GPT-3.5-Turbo and merely five gradient steps with a moderate learning rate of $5e^{-5}$ for Llama-2) only make this finding even more **surprising**. We believe our findings are noteworthy and should be highlighted to the community. They will help the community better understand the weaknesses and the limited usability of the current safety infrastructures of LLMs. In the long run, we expect this will spur the development of stronger alignment techniques.\n\n    * ***The three levels of risk hierarchy we present, and the mitigation analysis we perform, reveal oversights in current safety alignment infrastructures and contribute to a systematic understanding of the risk space.*** In the initial release of GPT-3.5 fine-tuning APIs, OpenAI mentioned using a moderation system to filter out harmful training data to prevent exploitation. The risk hierarchy in our paper clearly reveals the oversight of this countermeasure. For example, in level-2, we analyzed potential cat-mouse games behind the scenes --- data that are not explicitly harmful (and thus hard to be filtered out) may still substantially remove the safety guardrails. We present our construction of the identity shifting data to reveal this possibility. Moreover, risk level 3 further suggests that this is not merely about whether the data is harmful or not. Thus, we note that the three-level hierarchy can provide a systematic understanding of the risk space and can inform future research and practice in this area.\n\n         Additionally, the analysis of potential mitigation strategies we present also offers important takeaways for safety practitioners. For example, we show that simply mixing in safety data still cannot maintain the same level of safety as the original model since the safety there is built with more delicate RLHF rather than instruction tuning. Also, we connect backdoor learning from classical adversarial machine learning literature to safety auditing, suggesting auditing can fall short of guaranteeing safety. **(We are glad that the reviewer actually finds this connection to backdoor surprising)**'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Rebuttal (Part-III)'}, 'comment': {'value': '3. **Significant impact of only five gradient steps.**\n\n    In Remark 1 of Section 4.2, we highlighted that ""the 10-shot attack on Llama-2 (batch size of 10 with 5 epochs) literally only takes 5 gradient steps."" This corresponds to the 10-shot column of Llama-2-7b in Table-1, wherein we observed the attack increasing the harmfulness rate from 0.3% to 80.3%. The reviewer raised concerns whether this significant change is due to an overly large learning rate. We would like to clarify that this is not the case. In this particular experiment, **the learning rate is set at $5 \\times 10^{-5}$, which is a relatively moderate value.** Furthermore, both our manual inspection and the automated evaluation by GPT-4 demonstrated that the models can produce high-quality and accurate harmful outputs in response to harmful questions, suggesting that mode collapse is not responsible for this phenomenon.\n\n    We share the reviewer\'s surprise at these results and propose a couple of hypotheses for the observed behavior:\n    * The model did not unlearn the harmful behaviors during the alignment. The alignment process could only be adapting the model to a sub-mode in which the harmful behaviors are suppressed. However, this might be superficial, allowing a few gradient steps to quickly adapt the model back to the harmful mode. \n    * The inherent distribution of the pre-training corpus might naturally bias the responses to harmful questions towards harmful answers. Consequently, since the pre-existing bias leans towards harmfulness, it is conceivable that reverting the alignment back to the pre-training distribution is easier than the alignment process that aims to skew the legitimate distributions learned from the pre-training corpora.\n\n    We hope this explanation addresses the reviewer\'s concerns and provides a deeper understanding of the impact of limited gradient steps on the model behavior.\n\n\n4. **The idea of safe trainer.** We agree with the reviewer that the proposed safe trainer may not be capable of preventing malicious behavior from attackers in the context of open-source models. Our recommendation for integrating a safe trainer is primarily aimed at addressing benign fine-tuning instances. As our research demonstrates, it is possible for users with no malicious intent to inadvertently compromise the safety of models during fine-tuning for downstream applications. By developing safe trainers with built-in safety precautions as the default option, the open-source community can significantly alleviate the burden on downstream application developers with regards to managing safety risks. We believe that this is a crucial consideration since many such developers may not possess expert-level knowledge in the area of model safety.\n\n\n\n[1] Jain, Neel, et al.

We would like to clarify the differences as follows:\n    \n    * **Our attack is simpler, cheaper, and more effective:** **1)** Our attack is simpler, as it only involves standard fine-tuning with a few data points. Notably, OpenAI's fine-tuning service supports codeless development, enabling users to upload a file containing data for fine-tuning, with the refined model readily usable in the playground through a simple graphical user interface. This effectively allows anyone to unlock a model with a few mouse clicks and a handful of harmful data points. In contrast, previous prompt-based attacks usually involve either heavy trial-and-error or computationally demanding processes such as combinatorial search [3] or genetic algorithm [4]. **2)** Our attack is more cost-effective, costing less than $0.2 for ChatGPT or requiring a mere five gradient steps for Llama-2 to yield near-optimal results. **3)** Our attack is more effective compared to [3]. We can fairly compare our results with [3] by referring to Table 10 of our paper, in which we include an additional evaluation conducted on AdvBench with the ASR metric, identical to that of [3]. On GPT-3.5, our best result of 86.9% is comparable to the 86.6% reported in [3], while our 95.6% on Llama-2-7b outperforms their 88.0%.\n    \n        The reviewer expresses concern that previous prompt-based jailbreak attacks might undermine the significance of our attacks. On the contrary, our conclusion posits that the simplicity, affordability, and effectiveness of our attack render prompt-based attacks less preferred.\n    \n    * **Threat Model:** Unlike previous jailbreak attacks that aim to bypass the safety guardrails of models by handcrafting or optimizing specific patterns in the input prompt, our study works under a distinct threat model where we utilize fine-tuning to directly remove the safety guardrails. Given that the threat models differ significantly, the risk spaces and corresponding mitigations also differ. For prompt-based attacks, known jailbreak prompts could be continuously patched (several early jailbreak prompts have been patched and are no longer effective), and multiple prompt space defenses can be applied to mitigate the risks they pose, as demonstrated in [1,2]. These solutions cannot be applied to the fine-tuning-based attacks that we first formulated in this paper. Mitigating the risks posed by this type of attack requires exploring a different mitigation space, as we have analyzed in Section 5. Besides, our work also contributes to the understanding of a new attack surface other than the prompt input space.\n\n    * **Beyond Adversarial Threats:** As discussed in Section 3.2, the implications of our study extend beyond adversarial risks. We demonstrate that fine-tuning with benign data can compromise safety, particularly when the hyperparameters are more aggressive, evident in Figure 4(a). This effect could have broad implications for downstream model developers. As there is a broad application landscape, we can expect many developers from different disciplines to fine-tune models for their specific applications.

We are highly encouraged by the reviewer's feedback!\n\nWe also appreciate the suggestion to include a discussion on the potential causes for the observed fragility of current safety-enforcing methodologies. We will add more discussion of the underlying intuition. Here, we provide a consolidated view:\n\n* We suspect that the ease with which models can be adapted back to an unaligned mode is rooted in the same mechanism that allows us to adapt models so easily with a few examples in benign contexts. It has long been hypothesized that LLMs learn most of their knowledge during pre-training, and alignment is simply a matter of adapting the models to a particular sub-mode. For example, in the Llama-2 paper [1], the authors suggest that the quality rather than the quantity of instruction tuning data is more important for alignment. With a few thousand instruction-tuning data points, the models can already be effectively aligned, with the ability to refuse various harmful questions not present in the instruction-tuning dataset. Our attack is motivated by the inverse of this capabilityâif a few-shot learning capability can be used for good alignment, it could also be exploited inversely to subvert that alignment. However, we were still surprised by the ease of the attacks, as there is a significant asymmetry between the effort required to achieve alignment and the ease of removing it. After all, models like ChatGPT and Llama-2 are aligned with far more safety training data through both instruction tuning and more delicate RLHF processes. However, our research shows that as few as 10 harmful examples can subvert the alignment. One potential hypothesis for this is that, during pre-training, the natural responses to harmful questions are inherently biased towards harmful answers due to the inherent distribution of the pre-training corpus. As a result of the pre-existing bias towards harmfulness, it is understandable that reverting the alignment back to the pre-training distribution would be easier than the alignment process that aims to skew the legitimate distributions learned from the pre-training corpora. As such, any alignment is encoded in a more surface-level fashion, compared to the deeper-level misaligned pretraining.\n\n* In regard to the question of why benign fine-tuning still compromises safety, we discuss two perspectives in both the Introduction and Section 3.2. The first is the well-known phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. The second relates to the safety-utility trade-off. Alignment is a delicate balancing act that requires careful consideration of safety and utility through instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Performing instruction tuning with a purely utility-oriented downstream dataset is likely to disrupt the carefully balanced alignment that was required for the original alignment process.\n\n\nWe hope that consolidating these hypotheses and adding additional clarifications make our findings more intuitive and informative. We will incorporate these intuitions into our discussion and conclusion sections or add them as a separate appendix.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Touvron, Hugo, et al. âLlama 2: Open foundation and fine-tuned chat models.â arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.09288 (2023).""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Rebuttal (Part-II)'}, 'comment': {'value': '2. **Rationale for creating our own evaluation dataset**\n    \n    The reviewer raises concerns regarding our choice to create a custom dataset for evaluation, rather than relying on the publicly available Advbench dataset.\n    \n    We first note that we have already evaluated not only on our own evaluation set, but also on the publicly available Advbench dataset in Table 10 of Appendix F. In Table 10, we employed the official Advbench metric (Attack Success Rate) rather than the metric measured by our GPT-4 judge to ensure that the results are comparable with other studies that use Advbench for evaluation.\n    \n    The Advbench dataset, while valuable, is not policy-oriented and has a narrower scope compared to our objectives. It also does not sample uniformly across restricted categories. Our goal was to ensure comprehensive coverage of realistic harmfulness categories. To achieve this, we developed our own safety evaluation benchmark based on the exhaustive lists of prohibited use cases found in Metaâs Llama-2 usage policy and OpenAIâs usage policy (as detailed in Appendix B). With these fine-grained category-wise evaluation data, we get Figure-1 and Figure-6, fostering a more fine-grained understanding of modelsâ safety. This also helps shed light on heterogeneous treatment effects across different harmful categories in the safety alignment, which we highlight in our work. This is a contribution on its own, since prior work did not disentangle potential heterogeneous treatment effects.\n    \n    Although we have opted not to publish our dataset widely at this stage due to ethical concerns (as mentioned in our ethics and reproducibility statement), we appreciate the reviewerâs feedback on reproducibility. As such, we are developing an agreement that would allow us to share the data with verified researchers under strict terms that would prevent wide dissemination, but allow further inspection and experimentation with this data in restricted settings.\n    \n\n3. **Evaluation of generative capabilities of LLMs after fine-tuning.**    \n    \n    We appreciate the reviewer for bringing attention to the important issue of the influence of fine-tuning on the generative capabilities of LLMs. Due to the page limit, we deferred the detailed evaluation and discussion of this matter to Appendix D in our submission and only made an overview of this matter in Section 6 in the main paper.

The challenges in formulating effective mitigation strategies, as recognized by both the reviewer and our paper, also underscore the importance of this paper. This research contributes to the systematic understanding of this inherently complex issue and could serve as a foundation for further research aimed at overcoming these challenges. As Reviewer soMi notes, we set the groundwork and highlight the need for developing new mitigation strategies---of which we note several potential future directions in this work. This is no small task,  however, and will require extensive additional research.

For instance, we jailbreak GPT-3.5 Turbo's safety guardrails by fine-tuning it on only 10 such examples at a cost of less than $0.20 via OpenAI's APIs, making the model responsive to nearly any harmful instructions. Disconcertingly, our research also reveals that, even without malicious intent, simply fine-tuning with benign and commonly used datasets can also inadvertently degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, though to a lesser extent.

We understand that you would appreciate further details about the discovered architectures. We hope to address your concerns below.\n- **Structure and number of parameters:** We start with ResNet-18 and ViT, which are well-known architectures with well-documented number of parameters (11M and 22M respectively). These are fine-tuned and/or extended with additive modules: Between 0-16 TSA modules are added in the case of ResNet, and between 0-12 ETT modules  are added in the case of VIT. The specific architecture of TSA and ETT modules given in (Li et al 2022, Xu et al 2022) respectively, and already summarised for completeness in Table 1 of our paper. Each TSA module has 100K-2M parameters (depending where in the architecture it is attached), and each ETT module has 200K parameters. The number of parameters increased by adapting is not a fixed quantity, it depends on the result of the architecture search (e.g.,: Fig 2b defines the result of the architecture search by showing which option in Table 1 is used at each layer). With respect to parameter counts of our search space, and of the final models discovered within that search space, we summarise them below - together with a few related methods PMF, TSA, and ETT. Finally, we remark that although NFTS adds some parameters to the base network, our total number of parameters is still much less than the ensemble based methods like SUR (ECCV20) and URT (ICLR21), which are roughly 8x the base architecture size.\n| | ResNet-18 | ViT-S |\n| --- | :---: | :---: |\n| Base Parameter Count | 11M | 22M |\n| Number of Blocks | 16 | 12 |\n| Parameter Count per Adapter | +36K-2M | +200K |\n| Min-Max Possible Parameters Added in Search Space | 0 - 11M | 0 - 4M |\n| Min Max Possible Parameters Updated in Search Space | 0 - 22M | 0 - 26M |\n| Number of Actual Parameters after NAS (avg. over N=3 architectures) | 16M (+46%) | 25M (+14%) |\n| Number of Updatable Parameters After NAS (avg. over N=3 architectures) | 15M | 24M |\n| Actual Parameters Updated (TSA/ETT) | 11M | 4M |\n| Actual Parameters Updated (PMF) | - | 22M |\n- **The most differentiating point from the prior NAS structures:** Previous NAS methods focused on constructing architectures that are trained from scratch using large datasets. We develop a NAS approach specifically for searching how to adapt a pre-trained foundation model using a tiny few-shot dataset. The two crucial components of a NAS algorithm are 1) the search algorithm, and 2) the search space. We customize both of these for the few-shot learning problem. We design a search space that consists of the options to fine-tune or not each module (obviously fine-tuning is not applicable in standard NAS search spaces for models trained from scratch), and options to include additional adapters or not. For the search algorithm we extend SPOS into a two-stage algorithm that does most of the searching up-front during meta-train, and selects among a short list of candidate architectures during each few-shot learning episodes. This balances efficacy with runtime computational cost, as well as overfitting with underfitting. The positioning with respect to prior NAS is already explained in Related Work (Sec 4, paragraph âNeural Architecture Searchâ).\n- **Ablation study:** The requested ablation study is already covered by Tab 5. Please note that âNâ in NFTS-N denotes how many candidate architectures are left to be selected at meta-test time. \n    - *1-stage vs 2-stage hybrid NAS:* This requested comparison corresponds to NFTS-1 vs NFTS-N in Tab 5 (left). NFTS-1 uses the best performing path identified during meta-training. Our proposed NFTS-N uses the two-stage/hybrid approach to select N candidate paths during meta-training, and then pick the best among these N (N=3) during meta-testing, which leads to outperforming NFTS-1 in Tab 5. \n    - *2-stage hybrid vs test-time NAS:* The third option mentioned by the reviewer (fully conducting NAS during each meta-testing episode) is prohibitively costly to run as it corresponds to  NFTS-N with N=2^K. Therefore, this cannot practically be ablated. The closest to this that we were practically able to run is NFTS-N with N=100, shown in Tab 5 (right). Already at N=100, where performance has degraded compared to N=3. \n    - The explanation for both of the above comparisons is given in Sec 3.3. To reiterate: Without any NAS at test-time, there is no opportunity to tune the architecture according to the downstream dataset (NFTS-N > NFTS-1). With too much NAS at test-time, there are too many free parameters to fit with the small few-shot support set, and it is possible to overfit the training set and perform badly on the support set (Tab 5, right).'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer eX3h'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for reviewing our paper, and for acknowledging the novelty of our method. Please, find our response to your concerns below.\n- **Computational cost vs. performance gain:** This is a very good point. We agree that MetaDataset is a very popular and highly competitive benchmark, where it is no longer possible to easily make gigantic leaps over the state-of-the-art. However, you raise a valid concern: âIs it worth it to perform an architecture search for 1-2% improvement?â. Our thinking of this is as follows: 1) The main cost of our method is the first stage SPOS architecture search, which is a one-off cost during meta-training. Since the results of this search can be re-used for many subsequent few-shot recognition tasks, it is not unreasonable to pay a large cost upfront. This rationale is used by many other methods with expensive upfront costs such as MAML and others that use expensive second-order gradients during meta-training. 2) Our architecture search cost is not actually âexcessiveâ compared to alternatives. Our total meta-train cost is about 40GPUh, which is less than required for second order MAML on MetaDataset. It is also much less than methods that make heavy use of attention (e.g,: CrossTransformer requires 1300 V100 GPUh on MetaDataset - over 30x more than ours!). What is more, the majority of this cost comes from the meta-training-time search which can be trivially parallelized. 3) Our recurring meta-test cost (even including the small second-stage architecture search) is smaller than methods that use large feature extractor ensembles such as SUR (ECCV20) and URL (ICLR21), and/or cross-attention (URL, CTX). 4) A final benefit is that as a byproduct our method provides insight about your pre-trained architecture that may be valuable. E.g., as you point out in your question, some layers are always adapted, and some are never adapted.\n- **Architecture blocks consistently adapted/not adapted:** The vast majority of adaptation work hypothesizes that foundation models have a lot of knowledge encoded in their latent spaces. Having said that, allow us to answer your question with a toy example: Some architecture blocks may encode the notion of texture, or shape. Some other layers may encode the concept of a fish. The notion of texture is much more relevant to a large number of downstream visual recognition tasks than the concept of a fish, which is very domain-specific. This may be the reason why we see a âfish blockâ always adapted, but a âtexture blockâ always in its original form, as it can already do its job pretty well. Of course, this is a hypothetical example and it is still an open research question to properly identify which neurons represent which concept, as would be required to interpret our specific discovered architectures in this way. But in the meanwhile, this is exactly why it is helpful to have automated methods to identify which blocks to adapt/not adapt.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer mc8g'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your review, we are happy that you found our paper well-written, strong, and benefitial to the community. Please, find our response to your concerns below.\n- **Confidence intervals:** Initially, we did not include the confidence intervals for two reasons: 1) They are all quite small; the majority of standard errors are < 0.1%. This should have been explicitly stated in the paper. 2) As you accurately pointed out, the space limitations; since the confidence intervals are not very informative, adding a âÂ±0.002â to every column would make the tables even longer and unreadable. Given the small standard errors on the means, most of the differences between methods are statistically significant.

How hard is it for the human to identify the role of each head? Is it possible to introduce some humans during inference time to prune/select which head to use for final prediction?__\n\nIn our experiments, we manually annotated the heads by examining the output text descriptions of our algorithm. For many of the heads, this task is simple (requires finding a commonality between 60 text descriptions). A possible approach for automating it is to query an LLM to summarize the role of the head based on its text descriptions (e.g. âWhat is common between all these image descriptions?â). Moreover, for pruning the heads for a specific task (e.g. bird classification), we can provide the discovered head roles to an LLM, and query it about each spurious ques that each role can provide for the given task (e.g. âCan geo-location be a spurious cue for bird image classification?â). This model-driven strategy would probably be more efficient than introducing humans during inference time, which might be too costly.\n\n__âNote everything has a direct roleâ - Does it mean there exists complicated features that we need to leave it as a black box, or we can ignore them as redundant feature points?__\n\nBy ânot everything has a direct roleâ, we are referring to the fact that our analysis studies the direct effects of individual components on the output representation rather than indirect effects.\n\nIn more detail, the direct effects are the contributions of each layer to the residual stream (which is later projected into the output space). The indirect effects are the contributions of a layer that are processed by subsequent layers. Most of the early layers, for example, have meaningful indirect effects - they contribute to the inputs of later layers. To analyze these features, one should examine these contributions and their downstream effects. As a preliminary example of this, we unrolled the direct effect of a âcounting headâ, and found a second-order effect from an MLP layer that fires mostly when digits appear in the image, which could produce spurious cues if the presented digit usually corresponds to the number of objects in the images (e.g. a pack of 6 tomatoes with the text â6 tomatoesâ appearing on the pack). Removing the second-order effect of this MLP on this head may result in more accurate counting abilities.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. \n\n__""can the authors comment on how indirect effects can be leveraged to understand the internal representations?""__\n\nExamining the indirect effect can result in a finer understanding of the internal computation graph in these models. For example, we can analyze the second-order effects going through a specific layer/head (e.g. what does MLP 2 contribute to attention head 5 in layer 30).\nThis way, one can remove more fine-grained spurious correlations.\n\nAs a preliminary example of this, we unrolled the direct effect of a âcounting headâ, and found a second-order effect from an MLP layer that fires mostly when digits appear in the image, which could produce spurious cues if the presented digit usually corresponds to the number of objects in the images (e.g. a pack of 6 tomatoes with the text â6 tomatoesâ appearing on the pack). Removing the second-order effect of this MLP on this head may result in more accurate counting abilities.   \n\n__âDid the authors analyse the OpenAI CLIP variants using this framework? The OpenCLIP and OpenAI variants are trained on different pre-training corpus, so a good ablation is to understand if these properties are somehow dependent on the pre-training data distribution.â__\n\nWe provide here an additional comparison between OpenCLIP-ViT-L14 and OpenAIâs CLIP-ViT-L14. First, our observation that the last few attention layers have most of the direct effects on the final representation still holds: keeping the last 5 attentions, and ignoring the direct effects of other layers, result in only a small decrease from 75.5% to 73.2% in accuracy on ImageNet. \nSecond, we evaluate OpenAI\'s CLIP-ViT-L-14 for zero-shot image segmentation:\n\n| model | mIoU | Pixel-wise Acc. | MAP |\n|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| OpenAI ViT-L-14 | 55.24 | 76.19 | 81.37 | \n| OpenCLIP ViT-L-14 | 54.50 | 75.21 | 81.61 |\n\nAs shown here, the localization properties of OpenAI-CLIP are comparable to the results of OpenCLIP. \n\n__âWhile this (initial descriptions pool) set is a good starting point, can the authors comment on how this set can be extended to make it more diverse?â__\n\nWe repeat our experiments with a larger and more diverse image description corpus and present the results in section A.4 in the revised version. We query ChatGPT for class-specific descriptions and create an additional pool of 28767 unique sentences (8 times larger than our previous corpus). This results in higher accuracy with fewer basis vectors per head (smaller $m$) compared to the other pools that contain 3498 vectors, as shown in Figure 7. \n\nAside from this, and more importantly for future work, our method can be made adaptive, by applying it iteratively and using a data-driven refinement step to update the pool. Specifically, at each iteration, we can apply our algorithm to retrieve a basis set and the corresponding descriptions (which indicates roughly what concepts the model is using), query an LLM to generate âmore like theseâ descriptions (to retrieve more fine-grained descriptions), and add the generated new examples to the pool before re-computing the basis set again. This approach may result in more fine-grained descriptions that capture better the output space of each head. We plan to explore this idea further in future work. \n\n__Clarification about the image set in Sec. 4.1__\n\nWe apply our algorithm on ImageNet validation set (50000 images), as it is the largest and most diverse dataset we could use given our compute budget.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. \n\n__âNo ablation studies on the impact of the â¦ basis size (m)â__\n\nWe believe that Figure 3 already implicitly contains the desired ablation. Specifically, in Figure 3 we simultaneously replace each headâs direct contribution with its projection to the $m$ text representations found by our algorithm. We consider a variety of output sizes $m \\in \\\\{10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60\\\\}$. We evaluate the reconstruction by comparing the downstream ImageNet classification accuracy. As shown in the figure and discussed in section 4.2 the accuracy improves with larger $m$ values. We found that 60 descriptions ($m=60$) were sufficient to reach an accuracy that is close to the original model accuracy, but with fewer descriptions, the accuracy drops.\n\n__âNo ablation studies on the impact of the pool size (M)â__\n\nTo vary the pool size $M$, we repeat our experiments with a larger and more diverse image description corpus and present the results in section A.4 in the revised version. We query ChatGPT for class-specific descriptions and create an additional pool of $M=28767$ unique sentences (8 times larger than our previous corpus).

Our claim is only that the direct effect of the early layers on the output is negligible (Figure 2). In contrast, we expect the indirect effects to be large, since the early layers contribute to the inputs of later layers. \n\n__âIs it possible to achieve the âdualâ aspect of the text encoder of the CLIPâ__\n\nWhile we think that decomposing the text encoder is out-of-scope for this paper, we believe that such a dual analysis is possible, since the text encoder has a similar transformer architecture. Moreover, decomposing both the text encoder representation and the image encoder representation will allow us to examine what each (patch, word) pair contributes to the overall similarity score.

Will this also hold true where the representations are used for downstream tasks that require adaption?â__\n\nTo verify that the effect of the early attention layers and MLPs is negligible even after adaptation, we followed the suggested experiment and applied linear probing on ViT-B-14 for CIFAR100 classification. The test set accuracy of linear probing is 84.3. When we mean-ablate all the MLPs and the early attention layer up to the last 4 layers we get an accuracy of 84.2%. This suggests that even after adaptation, the late attention layers still have most of the effect on the output.\n\n__âHow do the zero-shot results compare against methods like MaskCLIPâ__\n\nMaskCLIP uses a different approach, that works only on CLIP models that have attention pooling before the projection layer. Differently from these models, other CLIPs (and specifically - all the OpenCLIP models) use the class token directly as the input to the final projection, without using attention pooling.

However, many studies show an attacker could carefully perturb the structure and/or node features in a graph such that a graph classifier misclassifies the perturbed graph. Such vulnerability impedes the deployment of graph classification in security/safety-critical applications. Existing empirical defenses lack formal robustness guarantees and could be broken by adaptive or unknown attacks. Existing provable defenses have the following limitations: 1)  they achieve sub-optimal robustness guarantees for graph structure perturbation, 2) they cannot provide robustness guarantees for arbitrarily node feature perturbations, 3) their robustness guarantees are probabilistic, meaning they could be incorrect with a non-zero probability, and 4) they incur large computation costs. We aim to address those limitations in this work. We propose GNNCert, a certified defense against both graph structure and node feature perturbations for graph classification. Our GNNCert provably predicts the same label for a graph when the number of perturbed edges and the number of nodes with perturbed features are bounded.

We agree with the reviewer that splitting&predictions&majority vote is a general randomized smoothing-based framework for certification. The key challenge is how to tailor this framework for different domains. For instance, (de)randomized smoothing (Levine & Feizi (2020)) divides an image into different blocks or bands, which are customized for images. Hammoudeh & Lowd (2023) extend this general framework to certify $\\ell_0$-norm perturbation for image and tabular data (all inputs have the same size) as mentioned by the reviewer.  By contrast, we focus on the graph domain, where the number of nodes and edges varies in each graph, making existing methods inapplicable. We develop three different methods to divide a graph into different sub-graphs. Our designs of three division methods (e.g., structure, feature, structure-feature division) are tailored to the graph domain. We will cite and discuss the difference with Levine & Feizi (2020) and Hammoudeh & Lowd (2023) as suggested. \n\n**Comment-2: Comparison of the accuracy of the normally trained GIN and GraphGuard with GIN trained on sub-graphs.**\n\nThanks for the suggestions. We add experiments to compare the accuracy as suggested. We have the following observations from the experimental results. On MUTAG, DD, COLLAB, DBLP, ENZYMES, PROTEINS datasets, the accuracy of GraphGuard is at most 3\\% lower than that of normally trained GIN. On REDDIT and NCI1 datasets, the accuracy of GraphGuard is at most 15\\% lower than that of normally trained GIN. The reason is that there is a tradeoff between accuracy without attacks and robustness (such tradeoff widely exists for certified defenses). Our GraphGuard (with GIN as the base classifier) reduces to GIN when $T_s=1$. To reduce the accuracy drop, we could set a smaller $T_s$ in practice. We will add the results to our paper and discuss this tradeoff. \n\nWe also compare the accuracy of base classifiers for different certified methods. As mentioned by the reviewer, the accuracy of GraphGuardâs base classifier is indeed higher than those of other defenses, which explains why our GraphGuard outperforms them. For instance, on MUTAG dataset, the accuracy of GraphGuardâs base classifier is 91.85\\%. By contrast, the accuracy of base classifiers for Bojchevski et al., Wang et al., Zhang et al. are 67.88\\%, 88.89\\%, and 82.59\\%, respectively. We will add the explanation. Moreover, we will discuss our observation is consistent with that in the image domain (Levine & Feizi (2020)).\n\n**Comment-3: The accuracy drop for protecting against structure and feature perturbations simultaneously on DBLP and ENZYMES.**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the accuracy of our GraphGuard drops on some datasets such as DBLP and ENZYMES for structure-feature division. The reason is that we aim to certify structure and feature perturbations simultaneously. Additionally, we consider an attacker could arbitrarily manipulate the features of a number of nodes. In other words, we consider a very strong attacker. To reduce the accuracy drop, we could divide a graph into less number of sub-graphs. For instance, on DBLP dataset, our GraphGuard achieves a 76\\% accuracy when dividing each graph into 9 sub-graphs ($T_s=3$, $T_f=3$). \n\n**Comment-4: Training the base classifier on sub-graphs.**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that this is standard practice in randomized smoothing. We will tone down our claim as suggested.\n\n**Comment-5: $\\alpha$ should be 0.001.**\n\nWe really appreciate the reviewer for pointing this out. We will fix the typo.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response 1 to the Reviewer xWrk'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewers for appreciating paper writing and the constructive comments\n\n**Question-1: Vary $N$ depending on the graph size.**\n\nThanks for pointing this out. We use a fixed number of sub-graphs on 8 datasets to be consistent. Our robustness guarantee against graph structure and node feature perturbation still holds when varying $N$ based on the number of nodes in a graph. For instance, we could set $T_s=0.3 * \\\\#nodes\\ in\\ a\\ graph$. On MUTAG dataset, the certified accuracies are 90\\% and 54\\% when an attacker could arbitrarily add/delete 1 and 5 edges.  We will add the discussion to our paper. \n\n**Question-2: No restrictions on the hash function (i.e., independent of edge structure and node features).**\n\nWe donât place restrictions on the hash function because we aim to resist arbitrary adversarial attacks (with bounded edge/node feature perturbations). If the hash function depends on the inputâs edge structure and node features, then it could potentially be influenced by the attacker, making it more challenging to derive formal robustness guarantees against arbitrary attacks. We will add the discussion. Note that our GraphGuard is compatible with any hash function. Figure 6 shows our GraphGuard achieves similar performance with different hash functions. \n\n**Question-3: Certify robustness against node insertion/deletion.**\n\nThanks for pointing it out. Our GraphGuard could be further extended to certify node insertion/deletion. In particular, we could divide nodes into different sub-graphs (using a hash function to calculate a group ID for each node), where each node only belongs to one group. Thus, inserting/deleting one node would influence at most one sub-graph, enabling us to derive the robustness guarantees. We added an experiment to validate this. On MUTAG dataset, our GraphGuard could achieve a 59\\% certified accuracy when an attacker could arbitrarily add/delete one node (note that the attacker could arbitrarily add/delete edges for that node).\n\n**Question-4: Local structure.**\n\nWe note that our GraphGuard with structure (or feature) division could utilize all node features (or entire graph structure). For structure-feature division, our method could utilize local structure with a moderate number of sub-graphs. We agree with the reviewer that each sub-graph may lose local structure information when the number of sub-graphs is large, i.e., there is a tradeoff between accuracy and robustness.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to the Reviewer nFKx'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewers for appreciating the novelty, significance, solid theory, and constructive comments!\n\n\n**Comment-1: The notation at the end of the line 4 on Page 4.**\n\nThanks for pointing it out. It is indeed $H(\\cdot)\\\\%T_s+1$. We will fix the typo.\n\n\n**Comment-2: The hash value depends on which node is visited first.**\n\nSorry for the confusion. We note that each node has a node ID. We always put the node with a smaller ID first. We also add an experiment to put the node with a larger ID first on MUTAG dataset. The certified accuracy is 92\\% (smaller ID first) and 92\\% (larger ID first) when an attacker arbitrarily adds/deletes one edge, respectively. The results demonstrate that our method is insensitive to the orders of nodes. We will clarify and add results to our paper. \n\n\n**Comment-3: How node features are transformed into string representations.**\n\nNode features could be represented as a feature vector, where each feature value is a real number. We transform each feature value into a string. For instance, if the feature value is 0.12, we can transform it into the string â0.12â. Then, we concatenate the strings for different feature values. We will clarify as suggested. \n\n\n**Comment-4: Preference of hash-based sub-sampling over $\\tau$ fraction-based sampling.**\n\nOur hash-based sub-sampling has the following advantages. First, our hash-based sub-sampling enables our defense to certify feature perturbation as well as both feature and structure perturbations for graph classification. By contrast, existing sub-sampling methods cannot. Second, hash-based sub-sampling divides a graph into sub-graphs deterministically while $\\tau$ fraction-based sampling generates sub-graphs probabilistically. As a result, our method could provide deterministic robustness guarantees while existing methods cannot due to the randomness in their sub-sampling. Third, our hash-based division makes our defense very efficient (as shown in Table 1). The reason is that our hash-based sub-sampling divides a graph into a moderate number of (e.g., 30) sub-graphs. By contrast, existing  $\\tau$ fraction-based sampling requires sampling hundreds of sub-sampled graphs to estimate the robustness guarantees (as they utilize Monte-Carlo to estimate them). Our experimental results in Figure 8 (in Appendix) show the certified accuracy of existing methods is much worse when reducing the number of sub-sampled graphs for them. \n\nIn general, there is a tradeoff between utility (measured by the accuracy without attacks) and robustness. One limitation of our defense is that it also has such a tradeoff. For instance, when the number of groups is very large, the accuracy without attacks of our defense slightly drops. The experimental results show our defense achieves a better tradeoff than existing methods.\n\n\n**Comment-5: How to determine the values of $T_s$ and $T_f$.**\n\nIn our experiment, we use a fixed $T_s=30$ and $T_f=30$ for all 8 datasets to be consistent. Additionally, we show the impact of $T_s$ and $T_f$ in Figures 4 and 5. Our results show GraphGuard could achieve better robustness guarantees when $T_s$ and $T_f$ are larger. We could set $T_s$ and $T_f$ based on the number of edges and nodes, respectively. In particular, we could set a larger $T_s$ and $T_f$ when the number of edges and nodes in a graph is larger to ensure better robustness.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to the Reviewer LqWt'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for appreciating the solid theoretical contributions and constructive comments!\n\n**Question-1: Was the perturbation uniform noise?**\n\nSorry for the confusion. The graph classifier built by our defense could resist arbitrary perturbations (e.g., uniform noise perturbation, carefully crafted perturbation by a malicious agent using a black or white-box attack) to a graph, once the total number of perturbed edges or number of nodes with perturbed features are bounded. For instance, with structure division, we derive a lower bound of the accuracy (i.e., certified accuracy) that our graph classifier could achieve on a testing dataset when an attacker could arbitrarily add/delete at most a number of edges (called perturbation size) to each testing graph. Take Figure 2 as an example. Our results show the accuracy drop of our graph classifier is within 3\\% when an attacker arbitrarily adds/deletes one connection to each testing graph. We will clarify. \n\n**Question-2: Add datasets for a realistic malicious agent scenario.** \n\nWe test a real-world Twitter dataset [1] as suggested, where the task is to classify whether a user is fake or benign based on its ego network. We use the white-box attack in [2] to craft a small perturbation such that a graph classifier makes incorrect predictions. For a standard graph classifier (GIN), the accuracy drops from 76\\% to 2\\% when adding/deleting at most 5 edges to each testing graph. Under the same perturbation, the accuracy of our GraphGuard is 68\\% for perturbed testing graphs. The results demonstrate that our GraphGuard is robust against carefully crafted perturbations. We will incorporate the results and corresponding discussion into our paper. \n\n[1] Zhang et al. âBackdoor Attacks to Graph Neural Networksâ, 2022. \n\n[2] Wan et al.

For example, Levine & Feizi (2020) designed a certifiably robust classifier that also splits the input into sub-parts, classifies the sub-parts using a base model, and makes the final classification using majority vote. While their method is applied to image classification to certify against patch attacks, the fundamental design pattern (and analysis) is similar to GraphGuard. More recently, Hammoudeh & Lowd (2023) showed that the same design pattern can be used to achieve certified robustness against L0 perturbations (including patch attacks) at training-time and test-time. Given this context, GraphGuard could be viewed as an extension of derandomized smoothing to a new domain (graphs), which could impact the assessment of technical novelty. **Update 21/11: The authors have promised to address this issue. I have therefore raised my _Presentation_ score from 1 to 3.**\n\n1. Although the experiments are comprehensive, I believe there is a crucial baseline missing: the base graph classifier (GIN) _without_ GraphGuard. Specifically, I would like to see a comparison of standard accuracy for GIN trained normally on full graphs, and GraphGuard with GIN trained on sub-graphs. This would allow for an assessment of GraphGuardâs impact on accuracy. This is important, as the standard accuracy of GraphGuard is fairly low for most datasets (around 70% based on Fig. 2)âitâs not clear whether this is due to GraphGuard or the inherent difficulty of the datasets. Incidentally, it may be interesting to report the accuracy of the base classifiers for all certified methods. Levine & Feizi (2020) found much higher base classifier accuracies for derandomized smoothing (which is similar to GraphGuard) than randomized ablation (which is similar to Zhang et al., 2021b). The same explanation may apply here. \n\n1. While GraphGuard outperforms prior methods in terms of certified accuracy, the standard accuracy is rather low (at around 70% for 6 of the 8 datasets). This has a bearing on the significance of the paper in my view, as the sacrifice in terms of accuracy seems to high to be practical. Itâs also worth noting that the variant of GraphGuard that protects against structure and feature perturbations simultaneously suffers a severe accuracy drop for some of the datasets (DBLP and ENZYMES). For these datasets, the classifiers are no better than random based on the standard accuracy in Figs. 9 and 10.\n\nMinor:\n1.

Such vulnerability impedes the deployment of graph classification in security/safety-critical applications.

Existing deep PLL research focuses on a \emph{learning-centric} perspective to design various training strategies for label disambiguation i.e., identifying the concealed true label from the candidate label set, for model training. However, when the size of the candidate label set becomes excessively large, these learning-centric strategies would be unable to find the true label for model training, thereby causing performance degradation. This motivates us to think from a \emph{data-centric} perspective and pioneer a new PLL-related task called candidate label set pruning (CLSP) that aims to filter out certain potential false candidate labels in a training-free manner. To this end, we propose the first CLSP method based on the inconsistency between the representation space and the candidate label space. Specifically, for each candidate label of a training instance, if it is not a candidate label of the instance's nearest neighbors in the representation space, then it has a high probability of being a false label. Based on this intuition, we employ a per-example pruning scheme that filters out a specific proportion of high-probability false candidate labels. Theoretically, we prove an upper bound of the pruning error rate and analyze how the quality of representations affects our proposed method. Empirically, extensive experiments on both benchmark-simulated and real-world PLL datasets validate the great value of CLSP to significantly improve many state-of-the-art deep PLL methods.",Oral 6C,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Fk5IzauJ7F,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Fk5IzauJ7F,Fk5IzauJ7F,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': ""This paper was reviewed by four experts in the field and received 8, 8, 8, 8 as the final ratings.

We would like to explain that the reason for not introducing [1] in our paper was that it focused on noisy-label learning instead of PLL. Now, we have cited the paper [1] in our revised paper to further improve the clarity. Indeed, the method proposed by [1] somewhat inspired us to develop a $k$-NN-based training-free method for PLL by extracting high-quality representations with a pre-trained feature extractor. We would like to emphasize that the task of CLSP proposed in the paper is inherently different and even more challenging than detecting label noise [1, 2] because the magnitude of false candidate labels in PLL is generally larger than the number of noisy labels in noisy-label learning. As for the methodology, the proposed CLSP method in our paper depends on the down-voting of nearby instances to eliminate potential false candidate labels, while the proposed method in [1] uses the majority of votes from nearby instances to detect noisy examples. Besides, Proportion 4.1 in [1] considers the lower bound of a correct detection in the binary classification case, while Theorem 1 in our paper provides an upper bound of an incorrect pruning in the multi-class classification case. Hence, we think that the proposed method for CLSP in our paper is inherently different from the method proposed by [1] for noisy-label learning.   \n\n[1] Detecting corrupted labels without training a model to predict.

I guess the author may have forgotten to divide n in the formulation of $\\beta$ in Definition 1, as $\\beta$ does not equal 1 but n in the optimal pruning case. Can the author clarify that?**\n\n**A:** Thanks for pointing out this issue.

We would like to explain that this assumption was formally introduced in the definition of PLL in Section 3.1 where each candidate label set $Y_{i}$ consists of a true label $y_{i}$ and a false candidate label set $Y_{i}^{\\prime}=Y_{i}\\backslash \\{y_{i}\\}$.

Indeed, conventional PLL methods could suffer from the negative impact of noisy PLL instances inevitably. Our countermeasure to alleviate this issue is to reduce the number of noisy PLL instances in the pruned PLL data as much as possible. For this purpose, we aim to decrease the upper bound of the pruning error by leveraging high-quality representations extracted from advanced feature extractors and using appropriate parameters in the proposed method. Empirically, the pruned PLL datasets only have a very small proportion of noisy PLL instances (as shown in Table 3), which makes PLL methods achieve impressive performance improvements. This observation definitely validates the negligible effect of noisy PLL instances caused by the proposed method. Besides, it would be also interesting to deal with potential noisy PLL instances directly during the pruning procedure. \n\n**Q2: More details about the $k$-NN algorithm and feature extractors.**\n\n**A:** Thanks for pointing out this issue. We have provided more details about the $k$-NN algorithm and the used feature extractors in Appendix C of our paper. Specifically, we employed the visual encoder of BLIP-2 [1] to extract 768-dimensional high-quality representations for all training instances in each PLL dataset. Then, we leveraged FAISS [2] to conduct the fast $k$-NN searching for each PLL instance based on the squared Euclidean Distance.\n\n**Q3: Consider the work [3] in related works and experiments.**\n\n**A:** Thanks for your suggestion! We have introduced the work [3] into the related work section of our paper. Moreover, we have conducted additional experiments by using the POP method [3] on the original and pruned PLL datasets following its suggested configurations. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are shown in the following tables. Note that O (vs. P) Test Acc means the test accuracy obtained by training on the original (vs. pruned) PLL dataset.\n\n|CIFAR-10|$q=0.4$|$q=0.6$|LD|ID|\n|:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |\n|O Test Acc|95.19|94.57|95.63|93.63|\n|P Test Acc|**95.64**|**95.48**|**95.87**|**95.05**|\n\n|CIFAR-100|$q=0.05$|$q=0.1$|LD|ID|\n|:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |\n|O Test Acc|76.35|74.38|74.90|73.36|\n|P Test Acc|**76.85**|**75.95**|**75.32**|**74.26**|\n\nFrom the above tables, we can see that POP equipped with our proposed CLSP method has significant performance improvements.\n\n**Q4: What is the main difference between a data-centric method and a pre-processing method?**\n\n**A:** Thanks for the interesting question. We think that our proposed data-centric method can be regarded as a special type of pre-processing method. This is because the proposed method can be used to pre-process training PLL instances before using these data to train deep PLL methods. We expect that our first data-centric method will motivate more studies on pre-processing methods for PLL. \n\n**Q5: Does the feature extractor in the $k$-NN algorithm come from the classifier during the training process? If yes, it seems unreasonable to say that the method is training-free. If not, a pre-trained model should be introduced.**\n\n**A:** Thanks for raising this concern. We would like to explain that the feature extractor does not come from the classifier during the training process. Instead, the feature extract comes from a multi-modal pre-trained model (e.g., CLIP, ALBEF, BLIP-2), which has not been trained on the corresponding PLL dataset. Hence, the proposed method is indeed training-free by leveraging a multi-modal pre-trained model. We have already introduced the pre-trained models in Section 4.1 of our original paper.\nNotably, to evaluate the effect of different types of feature extractors, we additionally trained two ResNet-18-based models (i.e., ResNet-SSL, ResNet-S) on the corresponding PLL dataset. Note that we did not use them in the proposed method and just used them for comparing the effects of different types of feature extractors. Specifically, ResNet-S was trained on each PLL dataset with the original clean supervision, while ResNet-SSL was trained on each PLL dataset by the self-supervised learning method SimCLR [4] without any supervision. More details about the training setup of these two feature extractors have been shown in Appendix C of our paper.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS\n\n[2] https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss\n\n[3] Progressive Purification for Instance-dependent Partial Label Learning.

(How are these values of $k$ and $\\gamma_{i}$ used to calculate the upper bound in Figure 1?)**\n\n**A:** Thanks for pointing out this issue. We have improved the clarity of this part in Section 3.3 of our paper. Our objective of the numerical simulation experiment is to evaluate the effects of representations of different qualities and different label ambiguities on the upper bound of the pruning error, for the proposed method. For this purpose, we empirically set various values of $\\delta_{k}$ and $\\rho_{k}$ where a small value of $\\delta_{k}$ ($\\rho_{k}$) implies high-quality representations (candidate label sets of low label ambiguity). By substituting the specific values of $\\delta_{k}$ and $\\rho_{k}$, we can calculate an exact upper bound with varying values of $k$ and different numbers of eliminated candidate labels $\\gamma_{i}$. In this way, we are able to know how to select suitable values of $k$ and $\\gamma_{i}$, with different feature extractors and PLL settings in the experiments.  \n\n**Q2: The PASCAL VOC dataset used in the experiment is not introduced well, as the dataset is not originally for partial label learning. (How is it used in partial-label learning?)**\n\n**A:** Thanks for raising the concern on the used PASCAL VOC dataset. In particular, we followed the previous work [1] to construct the dataset where objects in images were cropped as instances and all objects appearing in the same original image were regarded as the labels of a candidate set. In this way, we could obtain a PLL version of the PASCAL VOC dataset and perform any PLL method on this dataset. More characteristics of PASCAL VOC have been shown in Appendix C of our paper. \n\n**Q3: The detail of trained feature extractors (ResNet-SSL, ResNet-S) is shown unclearly.**\n\n**A:** Thanks for pointing out this issue. Specifically, ResNet-S was trained on each PLL dataset with the original clean supervision using the cross-entropy loss, while ResNet-SSL was trained on each PLL dataset by the self-supervised learning method SimCLR [2] without supervision. We have further detailed the training setup of feature extractors in Appendix C of our paper.\n\n**Q4: It would be appreciated if a clearer explanation for Definition 2 is provided. Why is this Definition needed?**\n\n**A:** Particularly, Definition 2 aims to characterize the candidate label distribution in the local representation space. Specifically, a PLL instanceâs $k$-NN instances are expected to have the true label in their candidate label sets with a high probability, while their candidate label sets are unlikely to have the same false candidate label. This characteristic contributes to the label distinguishability of candidate label sets in the local representation space, which is important for the proposed method to achieve a satisfying pruning error.\n\n**Q5: Why does the loss curve on VOC in Figure 5 have a rise (except the PRODEN algorithm)? This phenomenon is different from other cases on CIFAR and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.**\n\n**A:** The phenomenon is true that the training loss curves of certain PLL methods have a rise after training with pruned PLL data on PASCAL VOC in Figure 5. We reckon that there are two reasons. Firstly, there are more proportional noisy PLL instances in PASCAL VOC (the pruning error is 5.2\\%) than in CIFAR and Tiny-ImageNet (the pruning error is almost < 1\\%). Secondly, label disambiguation towards PLL instances in PASCAL VOC is more challenging due to the complicated visual objects in PASCAL VOC. Hence, fitting noisy PLL instances in PASCAL VOC is more difficult, thereby leading to a larger training loss value. More details are shown in Appendix D of our paper.  \n\n**Q6: What is the potential limitation of the proposed approach? Discussing this point is also important to have a comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach.**\n\n**A:** Thanks for raising the concern. We think that a potential limitation of the proposed method is the presence of noisy PLL instances in the pruned PLL dataset whose true label is incorrectly eliminated and inside the non-candidate label set. Besides, many PLL methods are incapable of dealing with noisy PLL instances in the pruned PLL datasets. To alleviate this issue, as analyzed in the numerical simulation experiment, we can decrease the upper bound of the pruning error by leveraging high-quality representations extracted from advanced feature extractors and using appropriate parameters in the proposed method, thereby effectively reducing the number of noisy PLL instances in the pruned PLL dataset. In addition, it would be also interesting to deal with potential noisy PLL instances directly during the pruning procedure.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Long-tailed partial label learning via dynamic rebalancing.

We have provided additional analyses on the experimental results of the transductive accuracy comparison in Table 7 and analyses on the training loss curves in Figure 5. For the transductive accuracy comparison in Table 7, we discover that naive PLL methods (e.g., CC, PRODEN, LWS, and CAVL) have more significant performance improvements than advanced PLL methods (e.g., PiCO, CRDPLL, ABLE, and IDGP). We think that this is because naive PLL methods have a limited capability in label disambiguation compared with advanced PLL methods, hence the proposed CLSP method has a bigger effect on promoting label disambiguation in naive PLL methods. For the training loss curves in Figure 5, we found an unusual phenomenon where the training loss values of many PLL methods become larger on PASCAL VOC after training with pruned PLL data. We reckon that there are two reasons. Firstly, there exists a higher proportion of noisy PLL instances in PASCAL VOC (where the pruning error is about 5.2\\%) than in CIFAR and Tiny-ImageNet (where the pruning error is less than 1\\% in most cases). Secondly, label disambiguation of training PLL instances in PASCAL VOC is more challenging due to the complicated visual objects in PASCAL VOC. Hence, fitting noisy PLL instances in PASCAL VOC is more difficult, thereby leading to a larger training loss value. More details of these empirical analyses have been shown in Appendix D of our revised paper.  \n\n**Q2: More explanations on bad cases are needed to show the limitations of the proposed method. (How to explain the phenomenon of bad cases?)**\n\n**A:** Thanks for raising the concern about bad cases! We have explained the potential reason for the based cases in the experiment results of our paper. Specifically, there are a few bad cases (4/149 $\\approx$2.7\\%) in the experimental results where the performance of certain PLL methods has slightly degraded after training with pruned PLL data. We argue that this is because the involved PLL methods (i.e., ABLE and SoLar) in the bad cases have a time-consuming training procedure (500 and 1000 epochs respectively), hence they tend to overfit noisy PLL instances eventually, thereby leading to performance degradation.   \n\n**Q3: How about pruning on noisy PLL instances?**\n\n**A:** Thank you for this interesting point! Regrettably, the proposed CLSP method may be infeasible to handle noisy PLL instances directly. This is because our method only focuses on the candidate label set and thus has no effects on noisy PLL instances whose true label is inside the non-candidate label set.  Fortunately, when the number of noisy PLL instances in the original dataset is not large, the proposed CLSP method can be still applied.\n\n**Q4: Could you show the values of $\\delta_{k}$ and $\\rho_{k}$ on the real-world dataset VOC?**\n\n**A:** Thanks for your suggestion. Following the empirical formulation of $\\delta_{k}$ and $\\rho_{k}$ shown in Section 4.1, we have conducted additional experiments to calculate their empirical values on PASCAL VOC. The calculated values of (1-$\\delta_{k}$) and $\\rho_{k}$ are shown in the following tables. \n\n|$k$|5|20|50|100|150|200|\n|:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |\n|1-$\\delta_{k}$|.792|.766|.736|.700|.676|.550|\n\n|$k$|5|20|50|100|150|200|\n|:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |\n|$\\rho_{k}$|.655|.604|.580|.565|.557|.550|\n\nFrom the above tables, we can see that the values of (1-$\\delta_{k}$) and $\\rho_{k}$ both decrease progressively as the value of $k$ increases. Further compared with the values on CIFAR in Figure 3, the values of (1-$\\delta_{k}$) on PASCAL VOC are smaller than on CIFAR, which implies the quality of representations on PASCAL VOC is lower than on CIFAR. On the other hand, the values of $\\rho_{k}$ on PASCAL VOC are larger than on CIFAR in most cases, indicating that label ambiguity in PASCAL VOC is more severe than in CIFAR. Hence, the proposed CLSP method is more challenging to employ on PASCAL VOC.\n\n**Q5: A unified proportion $\\tau$ for each training instance is used in Eq. (2). Are there other ways to adaptively control the number of eliminated candidate labels for each training instance?**\n\n**A:** The answer is positive! It is feasible to eliminate different numbers of candidate labels in training PLL instances in an adaptive manner. We can formulate the problem of adaptively deciding the optimal number of eliminated candidate labels for each training PLL instance as an integer programming problem. In this case, certain optimization techniques might be required to solve the integer programming problem.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'The paper pioneers a data-centric study for the problem of partial-label learning (PLL) where each training instance is assigned with some additional false candidate labels along with its true label and proposes a new PLL related task named candidate label set pruning (CLSP) that aims to filter out false candidate labels of the training PLL data.

Existing deep PLL research focuses on a \\emph{learning-centric} perspective to design various training strategies for label disambiguation i.e., identifying the concealed true label from the candidate label set, for model training. However, when the size of the candidate label set becomes excessively large, these learning-centric strategies would be unable to find the true label for model training, thereby causing performance degradation. This motivates us to think from a \\emph{data-centric} perspective and pioneer a new PLL-related task called candidate label set pruning (CLSP) that aims to filter out certain potential false candidate labels in a training-free manner. To this end, we propose the first CLSP method based on the inconsistency between the representation space and the candidate label space. Specifically, for each candidate label of a training instance, if it is not a candidate label of the instance's nearest neighbors in the representation space, then it has a high probability of being a false label.

For example, we have a unified VAE approach to do source separation and transcription [1]. Of course the current work is novel but it would be better to include those studies and compare the approaches in related work.**\n\n**[1] Liwei Lin, Gus Xia, Qiuqiang Kong, Junyan Jiang: A unified model or zero-shot music source separation, transcription and synthesis. ISMIR 2021: 381-388**\n\nThank you for pointing this out. We will definitely include and discuss the mentioned paper in our section on generative separation.\n\n**What is the novelty compared to NCSN-BASIS? Any intuition for MSDM Dirac? Is it a marginal improvement from existing methods, or not?**\n\nThe main difference between NCSN-BASIS and ISDM is the proposed DIract likelihood, which allows us to consistently improve generation/separation results with respect to the Gaussian one, used in NCSN-BASIS. This better performance may be attributed to Dirac's enforcement of mixture consistency during inference. Moreover, we propose the MSDM model, able to generate consistent mixtures composed of multiple tracks of individual instruments, which is not possible with NCSN-BASIS.\n\n**The introduction of ISDM method is not clear. Is it a baseline method where the assumptions are obviously wrong? Is it another valid approach? Compared to MSDM, is there a trade-off in terms of generation quality and separation performance?**\n\nThank you for pointing out this lack of clarity in the explanation of the role of ISDM. Essentially the method allows us to demonstrate the effectiveness of generative source separation when combined with Dirac likelihood. It is indeed **not** a valid approach for total and partial generation because the interdependencies between sources are not modeled, and thus it is unable to generate the constituents of a full track, contrary to MSDM (while able to generate a single type of source). This explanation has been added to the section where ISDM is introduced in the revised paper.\n\n**The introduction of correction step is okay. Since it is evaluated in the experiment section, could you explain more in the paper? What is the statement to be expected prior to the experiment regarding correction step?**  \n\nFollowing your suggestion, we moved the section on the sampler details, correction step included, in the main paper. Prior to using correction, we expected the model to have lower performance, given that in literature, predictor-corrector methods usually work better than predictor alone [6]\n\n[6] Yang Song, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Diederik P. Kingma, Abhishek Kumar, Stefano Ermon, & Ben Poole.  (2021). Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations.\n\n**Questions**\n\n**Q1: The separation result of ISDM and MSDM in Table 2 suggests a trade-off in terms of generation quality and separation performance. Is it confirmed? If so, why using a unified approach for source separation and generation? I understand on one hand, ISDM helps to show the diffusion method is comparable to the SOTA method. However, since MSDM is always lower than ISDM, I doubt the fundamental assumption in this paper is not valid that it is superior to use joint distribution to model generation and separation at the same time.**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the question. Actually, we do not claim that modeling the joint distribution (MSDM) brings a significant benefit to the separation task, but it enables the generalization of consistent instrumental stems, which is not possible with ISDM. \n\nAs for the tradeoff, a direct comparison of the quality of the two models is not possible only through the results contained in Table 2 because the total number of parameters in the two methods is different. Indeed, each model in ISDM uses the same number of parameters as the full MSDM, resulting in the ISDM being able to exploit 4 times parameters to model all 4 instruments. The goal of Table 2 was to show the effectiveness of generative source separation when combined with the proposed Dirac likelihood (in both ISDM and MSDM).\n\nIn general, having a single model, like MSDM, for multiple tasks is more versatile, not requiring specialized solutions for different individual tasks, similar to how LLMs can handle different tasks with a single model.\n\n**Q2: Could you provide some demos for ISDM method (Now or after publication)?**\n\nThanks for your interest, we will certainly provide demos for ISDM separation on the GitHub page after publication.""}}, {'comment': {'value': '**Questions**\n\n**The fact that the ISDM method outperforms MSDM on certain sources (Table 2) seems contrary to the intuition that jointly modeling dependencies between sources should improve separation results. Could the authors elaborate on these results, and perhaps conjecture as to why independently modeling sources with ISDM improves (or at least does not substantially deteriorate) performance versus jointly modeling with MSDM?**\n\nUnfortunately, a direct comparison of the quality of the two models is not possible only through the results contained in Table 2 because the number of parameters in the two models is different. Indeed, each model in ISDM uses the same number of parameters as MSDM, resulting in the ISDM being able to exploit 4 times parameters to model all 4 instruments. The goal of Table 2 was to show the effectiveness of generative source separation when combined with Dirac likelihood (in both ISDM and MSDM). Nevertheless, we can speculate that information about the joint distribution is redundant for the separation task, as the mixture itself is provided as the conditioning input. \n\n**Given the apparently high data requirements of MSDM, have the authors explored fine-tuning the Slakh2100 model on smaller datasets (e.g. MUSDB)? The authors mention potentially using the outputs of a source separation system to scale up the dataset (akin to SingSong), but fine-tuning also seems like an interesting avenue to explore -- especially given its popularity with diffusion models more generally.**\n\nIn Table 6 in the revised paper, we added also metrics for MSDM trained on Slakh2100 and finetuned on MUSDB on the common Bass and Drums sources. We observe that with respect to the model trained on Slakh and tested on MUSDB, fine-tuning has a very positive effect, however not competitive with Demucs.\n\n**Did the authors conduct any separation or generation experiments with out-of-distribution data?**\n\nAs answered in the first weakness, Table 6 also reports the evaluation for MusDB test set on MSDM trained on Slakh.

Presumably, separation time is linear in the number of inference steps (plus correction); it would be nice to see this explicitly compared to Demucs with and without Gibbs sampling. Similarly, if the proposed method is more data-hungry than discriminative methods such as Demucs (e.g. if the proposed method is not competitive when trained/evaluated on MUSDB), this might be worth emphasizing further. Parameter counts for each method would also be nice to see.**\n\nTo address requests about inference time and parameter count, we've included a new table, Table 4, in the appendix of the revised paper. This table displays these metrics for the models mentioned in Table 2 (MSDM, ISDM, Demucs and Demucs + Gibbs). Additionally, Table 6 provides metrics for training and evaluation on MusDB. \n\nRegarding parameter count and data efficiency, as expected, our methods require more resources. Demucs is indeed a regressor trained specifically for separation, while MSDM is also generative, and generative models are notoriously parameter and data-hungry (for reference, Mousai is trained on 2500 hours of audio and has 857M parameters, more than double our parameter count).\n\nAccording to Table 4, inference times for 12 seconds of audio on a single GPU are approximately 0.1s for Demucs, 5s for MSDM, 20s for ISDM, 30 seconds for Demucs + Gibbs (256 steps), and 1 minute for Demucs + Gibbs (512 steps). Demucs + Gibbs (256 steps) was added because 256 is the minimum number of steps that makes the SI-SDRi over all instruments (17.59) greater than the one of ISDM. This makes ISDM time-competitive compared to Demucs + Gibbs (256 and 512 steps). \n\n**Based on the listener study and provided listening examples, MSDM struggles to produce coherent and high-quality generations -- even when judged in the context of its synthetic training data. To my ears, it seems like tempo sometimes degrades within the model's 12-second context for unconditional generations, and for imputation generations when strongly metric signals (drums, bass) are not given as conditioning. Overall, the separation results seem much stronger than the generation results.**\n\nMaintaining coherence for 12 seconds of audio is indeed a challenging task for all generative models. There is extensive literature on how mitigate this issue, such as by employing finer controls like rhythmic structure, as seen in approaches like [5]. With separation, this issue does not arise because long-term coherence is inherently provided by the input mixture.\n\n[5] Shih-Lun Wu, Chris Donahue, Shinji Watanabe, & Nicholas J. Bryan.  (2023).

Is there any intuition as to the variance in results across the techniques?**\n\nFrom Table 2 we can observe that the same model with Gaussian likelihood achieves inferior separation results, which suggests that the effective good performance of ISDM with respect to Demucs and Demucs + Gibbs is more attributable to the Dirac likelihood than to generative-based separation itself. This is likely because the mixture consistency enforced by Dirac during inference assists in the separation task. However, this advantage becomes less noticeable for the guitar and piano stems, as their similar sound profiles make them difficult to separate using a generative-based approach, which explains the inferior performance of ISDM and MSDM reported in Table 2. Note that without the 512 Gibbs steps, even a regressor like Demucs, trained exclusively on the separation task, has a significantly inferior performance on the piano with respect to the other stems.\n\n**Is there an understanding of the approach's data efficiency?

What are the high-level takeaways from the qualitative results in Table 3 beyond those that the reader could intuit or speculate about?**\n\nFor Demucs, MSDM, and ISDM, separating Guitar and Piano presents a notable challenge due to their similar sound profiles in Slakh2100. This similarity often leads to source spilling between the two stems during separation, potentially harming performance. Interestingly, Gibbs sampling seems to enhance the performance of Demucs + Gibbs in these cases. The performance boost likely stems from Gibbs sampling's property of fixing one source while generating the other.\n\nLooking at Table 3, we notice that increasing the number of conditioning sources (thereby reducing the number of generated sources) consistently improves the FAD score in a near-monotonic manner. This improvement is logical, considering that more conditioning data simplifies the generation task, and more ground truth sources are included in the evaluated mix. However, when generating a single source (Drums) while conditioning on the other three (Bass, Guitar, Piano), we observe a decline in FAD score. This suggests that the strong rhythmic structure provided by the drums makes it easier to generate the other sources, in line with reviewer K9Yj's observations. In future work, we plan to explore the integration of additional conditioning elements, like the controls in the study found at [2], which could complement the conditioning sources in our model.\n\n[2] Shih-Lun Wu, Chris Donahue, Shinji Watanabe, & Nicholas J.

Although the causes of such instabilities are of scientific interest, the amount of resources required to reproduce them has made investigation difficult. In this work, we seek ways to reproduce and study training instability at smaller scales. First, we focus on two sources of training instability described in previous work: the growth of logits in attention layers (Dehghani et al., 2023) and divergence of the output logits from the log probabilities (Chowdhery et al., 2022). By measuring the relationship between learning rate and loss across scales, we show that these instabilities also appear in small models when training at high learning rates, and that mitigations previously employed at large scales are equally effective in this regime. This prompts us to investigate the extent to which other known optimizer and model interventions influence the sensitivity of the final loss to changes in the learning rate. To this end, we study methods such as warm-up, weight decay, and the MuParam (Yang et al., 2022), and combine techniques to train small models that achieve similar losses across orders of magnitude of learning rate variation. Finally, to conclude our exploration we study two cases where instabilities can be predicted before they emerge by examining the scaling behavior of model characteristics such as activation and gradient norms.",Oral 7A,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=d8w0pmvXbZ,https://openreview.net/forum?id=d8w0pmvXbZ,d8w0pmvXbZ,"[{'title': {'value': 'Clarifying independent WD'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Note that there is learning rate (step size) denoted as $\\alpha$  and schedule $\\eta_t$ in Loshchilov and Hutter [33]\'s Algorithm 2.

We hope that the following addresses your reported weaknesses and questions:\n\n> A significant part of the paper is dedicated to replicating observations made in large transformers to small transformers. The utility of this is a little unclear. While it demonstrates that a small model with high LR could serve as a proxy for a larger model, it doesnât demonstrate any new insights regarding large models. It would be more impactful if the authors would make previously unknown observations at a small scale, and then show that they hold at a larger scale.\n\nWe believe that our research yields new insights. For instance, the instability described in Section 3.4 has not previously been documented. Moreover, we believe that establishing small-scale models as reliable proxies is a useful new development which opens the door for further research on understanding/mitigating instabilities.. For instance, future research could confirm the hypothesis in Section 3.1.1, which is that large attention logits result from quadratic dependence on parameter norms\n\n> Section 3.3 reads a little anecdotal to me. A more systematic study would be better.\n\nWe agree with this and have revised the paper to list this as a limitation in Section 5.\n\n> Should LR sensitivity be normalized somehow? The optimal loss scales with model size, so the delta in eval loss between models of different scales are not really comparable.\n\nThank you for this interesting suggestion. We usually observe that LR sensitivity increases with scale. If we understand correctly, normalizing would only exaggerate this effect, because it would amplify differences at lower loss values?\n\n> Will the code be open sourced?\n\nWe believe that the important parts of the code we use are open source, and draw attention to them here: 1) qk-layernorm is implemented as part of MultiHeadDotProductAttention in Flax https://github.com/google/flax/blob/70214f4ecee59fdd82c07b692d4ad3d47149fe3d/flax/linen/attention.py#L438-L442, 2) z-loss is implemented as part of t5x: https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/t5x/losses.py#L53-L56.'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""We thank you for your comprehensive review, and hope that the following addresses the questions and weaknesses:\n\nIn response to the questions:\n\n> Are we really sure that the reason for large transformers not training well is [attention and output] logit divergence?\n\nWe do not intend to claim that logit divergence is the only reason for large-scale Transformer training instability. However, we are relatively certain that the specific forms of training instability we study in Section 3.1 are caused by logit divergence. There are a few experimental results which support this conclusion:\nIntervening to reduce the attention logit norms via qk-layernorm mitigates instability at high learning rates (Figure 1 and F.1).\nIn Figure 6, all runs which have an attention logit maximum above 10^4 are unstable, while all other runs are stable.\nIntervening to increase the attention logits in small (10M parameter) models at low learning rates deteriorates accuracy (Appendix E).\nIntervening to reduce the divergence of the output logits via z-loss mitigates instability at high learning rates (Figure 2 and F.2).\n\n> What are other possible problems?\n\nThere are a number of other possible problems with Transformer training. One which we highlight in Section 3.4 is vanishing updates due to the AdamW epsilon hyperparameter. Another potential problem is slower learning due to âfast loss spikesâ, as discussed in Section 4. Overall, we believe our results suggest that additional potential instabilities can be studied using small-scale proxy models.\n\n> What do we learn in the end from your analysis?\n\nOverall we learn that we can reproduce, study, and predict Transformer training instabilities at large-scale using small-scale proxy models. The revised conclusion shares some highlights: âThis paper demonstrates that useful insights on instability can be gained from small Transformers. Our results indicate that: (1) instabilities previously reported at scale can be reproduced in small-scale proxy models, facilitating their study without access to large resource pools; 2) instabilities previously reported at scale can be predicted before they emerge by extrapolating from experiments with small-scale proxy models; and 3) new instabilities can be found using small-scale proxy models.â.\n\n> Is it clear that such problems don't arise in other architectures?\n\nWe believe that further experimental evidence would be required to make concrete conclusions about other architectures. However, a similar instability to attention logit growth would likely not occur in MLPs or CNNs. This is because, as we hypothesize (in Section 3.1.1), this instability may result from the quadratic dependence of attention logits on parameter norms. This quadratic dependence does not occur in MLPs or CNNs.\n\nIn response to the weaknesses:\n\n> The structure of the paper is a little weird (the conclusion is very short and contains no useful information, the discussion of existing results is just put at the end without much being done from it, the main points seem to be made in the figures. ).\n\nWe acknowledge this oversight. In our revision we have changed the conclusion so that it is more informative. It now reads: âThis paper demonstrates that useful insights on instability can be gained from small Transformers. Our results indicate that: (1) instabilities previously reported at scale can be reproduced in small-scale proxy models, facilitating their study without access to large resource pools; 2) instabilities previously reported at scale can be predicted before they emerge by extrapolating from experiments with small-scale proxy models; and 3) new instabilities can be found using small-scale proxy models.â\n\n\n> The way the logits in the attention mechanism pose problem is not made super clear or intuitive (obviously, it's a little hard to prove something, but at least some intuition would be appreciated). For instance, we learn that high enough learning rate will pose problem at some point, but that's the kind of things that is not surprising. Does this validate the whole hypothesis?\n\nWe agree that intuition could be helpful. However, further experiments may be required to make concrete conclusions. One reason a large attention logit could cause an issue is by saturating softmax and restricting gradient flow.\n\nIn response to additional comments:\n\n> The authors' main point seems to be about the attention and output logits in transformer yielding instabilities. This may be a valid point, although it is not very how to mitigate this problem [...].\n\nWe believe our results indicate that z-loss and qk-layernorm are effective mitigations which enable stable Transformer training even at high learning rates.\n\n> Do authors use uniform distribution over lr? If yes, why not uniform over log(lr)?\n\nThe learning rate values we use in our experiments are (approximately) evenly spaced on a log scale: [1e-4, 3e-4, 1e-3, 3e-3, 1e-2, 3e-2, 1e-1, 3e-1, 1e0].""}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank you for the thoughtful review, and are glad that you found this paper to have âpotential to provide a wealth of useful informationâ. We hope to resolve your question below:\n\n> While I am not extremely familiar with the large-transformer-models community, I am under the impression that the pool of persons effectively concerned by this work is very small. As the authors note, training such large models is very computationally expensive, and currently only very few groups have the means to train such models. As a result, I wonder if this subject might be in practice rather niche, in terms of how much of the community could actually use it.\n\n\nThe expense of training large models indeed means that few researchers will observe the training instabilities we study in practice, but it also means that research aimed toward understanding instability can be immensely practically impactful. Despite limits on the size of models they can train, academic researchers have successfully studied many different aspects of Transformer-based models. There is some published research regarding Transformer training instability [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], but it has been less popular than e.g. architecture, likely due to perceived difficulty of studying training instability on a small compute budget. Our goal is to enable such studies by showing that it is possible to elicit training instabilities representative of those observed at large scale in smaller models. While Transformer training instability is currently a niche topic, we believe that it is both scientifically interesting and practically impactful, and we hope our work is a useful step in enabling more researchers to explore this area.\n\n[1] Gilmer et al., 2021.

What do the authors mean by ""optimal"" in this context? Is the meaning of ""optimal"" coming from the discussion in section 2.2? Some clarification on this in the main text would be good.\n\nWe apologize that this was unclear. In this context, we use optimal to refer to $\\ell^*$ in Section 2.2, which is the minimum loss achieved in the learning rate sweep.

One factor at play with this finding may be the fact that in standard initialisation schemes, changing the width of the network affects the initialisation scale of the weights, whereas increasing the depth does not. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that changing the width does not impact stability as much as depth, because the change in width is somewhat accounted for by the adaptive initialisation. Can the authors comment on why this occurs?\n\nWe believe it is an open question why depth increases LR sensitivity at a faster rate than width in our experiments. As you suggest, a different initialization or parameterization when scaling depth may resolve this issue. This is an interesting question for future research.\n\n> Point on phrasing: In section 3.3 the authors write ""We now examine whether it is possible to predict the logit growth instability before it occurs."" I think this phrasing is a little ambiguous because it may be interpreted as predicting whether a logit growth instability will occur in an ongoing run, based on the data collected in the current run. By contrast, to my understanding, the authors are using previous runs with different hyperparameters, to determine whether a particular hyperparameter setting will cause an instability or not. I think stating this more clearly in the main text would be beneficial.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We agree and have changed the main text to state this more clearly as youâve recommended.

Can the authors comment on whether they expect their findings to extend to other commonly used optimisers?\n\nIndeed, we use AdamW in our experiments. We choose AdamW because it is a popular optimizer used for many large scale runs including GPT-3 and LLaMA. We believe that some of the Transformer training instabilities we study are present when using other optimizer variants. For instance, the output logit divergence instability (Section 3.1.2) is reported by Chowdhery et al., 2022 for the PaLM model, which uses the âparameter scalingâ feature from Adafactor. On the other hand, we expect that some instabilities we study are absent when using other optimizers. For instance, the epsilon instability from Section 3.4 is not expected when using SGD, since SGD has no epsilon hyperparameter.\n\n> Weaknesses: âAbsence of concrete rules of thumbâ and âLimitation to C4 dataâ.\n\nWe absolutely agree with these limitations. We have revised Section 5 to include a subsection which highlights both of these limitations.\n\nAs you highlight in your review, âthe experimental work in this paper was well executed and carefully controlledâ. Unfortunately, we believe that in order to provide concrete rules of thumb or study the effect of data, a large number of further experiments would be required for us to be confident in the findings and maintain the overall standard of careful experimentation.

model size increases (e.g. figure 1 and figure 6), training instabilities occur at smaller learning rates.\nFurthermore, the authors show that two existing instabilities that are observed in large transformers (i.e. the growth of logits in attention layers and the divergence of output logits) can be reproduced in smaller models.\nThis is convincing evidence that the authors' findings on interventions made on smaller models are likely to translate to larger ones, since the mechanism of the instabilities is common across different scales.\nIn addition, pointing out this relationship is interesting and also potentially useful towards the development of large transformer models, as it provides strong evidence for adjusting the learning rate as a function of model size.\n\n\n__Verifying the effectiveness of qk-layernorm and z-regularisation:__\nThe authors showed that using qk-layernorm (figure 1) and/or z-regularisation (figure 2) significantly helps mitigate instabilities, reducing sensitivity to the learning rate across a range of model sizes, and increases the range of stable learning rates.\nThis suggests that qk-layernorm and z-regularisation are good candidates for mitigating instabilities in small models, and likely also sufficient for mitigating these effects in large transformers as well.\n\n\n__Extrapolating instabilities:__\nThe authors demonstrate that the hyperparameter regimes which result in instabilities can be predicted by looking at the maximum attention logits from other runs.\nIn particular, in figure 6, they show that for a model with no qk-layernorm, both the value of the maximum attention logit as well as the occurrence of an instability can be predicted by extrapolating from smaller runs and different learning rates.\n\n__Overall thoroughness of ablations:__\nI found that the ablations performed in this work were very thorough and supported the claims made in the main text very well.\nThe documentation of

thoroughness of the ablations, this is a relatively minor point.\nHowever, I think that a short discussion of how a practitioner could use the insights in this paper to fix training instabilities and

First, we focus on two sources of training instability described in previous work: the growth of logits in attention layers (Dehghani et al., 2023) and divergence of the output logits from the log probabilities (Chowdhery et al., 2022). By measuring the relationship between learning rate and loss across scales, we show that these instabilities also appear in small models when training at high learning rates, and that mitigations previously employed at large scales are equally effective in this regime. This prompts us to investigate the extent to which other known optimizer and model interventions influence the sensitivity of the final loss to changes in the learning rate. To this end, we study methods such as warm-up, weight decay, and the MuParam (Yang et al., 2022), and combine techniques to train small models that achieve similar losses across orders of magnitude of learning rate variation.

To address this issue, one feasible solution is learning the correspondence between video clips and captions, which however inevitably encounters the multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) problem. To be specific, MNC refers to the clip-caption misalignment (coarse-grained) and frame-word misalignment (fine-grained), hindering temporal learning and video understanding. In this paper, we propose NOise Robust Temporal Optimal traNsport (Norton) that addresses MNC in a unified optimal transport (OT) framework. In brief, Norton employs video-paragraph and clip-caption contrastive losses to capture long-term dependencies based on OT. To address coarse-grained misalignment in video-paragraph contrast, Norton filters out the irrelevant clips and captions through an alignable prompt bucket and realigns asynchronous clip-caption pairs based on transport distance. To address the fine-grained misalignment, Norton incorporates a soft-maximum operator to identify crucial words and key frames. Additionally, Norton exploits the potential faulty negative samples in clip-caption contrast by rectifying the alignment target with OT assignment to ensure precise temporal modeling. Extensive experiments on video retrieval, videoQA, and action segmentation verify the effectiveness of our method.

Is it fixed per epoch or adaptive to different batches? How sensitive is the performance to different values of $p$?*\n\nThe alignable prompt bucket (APB) is designed to filter out irrelevant clips and captions during coarse-grained clip-caption alignment. The value $p$ of the bucket functions as the **similarity margin** that distinguishes between alignable and unalignable clips and captions. In our implementation, we dynamically determine the value of $p$ as the bottom 30% similarity of the original aligned clip-caption pairs for **each batch**. This real-time adaptive approach ensures the relevance of the margin $p$ with the clip/caption pairs during training, responding to potential changes in alignment patterns per iteration. \n\nIn ablation studies, we integrated the prompt bucket into the optimal transport framework and varied the value of $p$ as the bottom 10%, 30%, and 50% similarity between the original aligned clips and captions. The results presented in the table below demonstrate our method's robustness to different choices of $p$.\n\n| Method           |   Clip   |   Clip   | Video (w/o B) | Video (w/o B) | Video  (w B) | Video  (w B) |\n| :--------------- | :------: | :------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :----------: | :----------: |\n|                  |   R@1    |   R@5    |      R@1      |      R@5      |     R@1      |     R@5      |\n| $p$=10%          | **24.2** |   51.8   |     88.4      |   **98.8**    |     75.9     |     94.9     |\n| $p$=50%          | **24.2** | **51.9** |     88.4      |     98.6      |     75.9     |     94.9     |\n| $p$=30% ï¼oursï¼ | **24.2** | **51.9** |   **88.7**    |   **98.8**    |   **76.1**   |   **95.0**   |\n\n> ***Question 4:** How do you deal with clips or captions that have different lengths as you choose a random window size for clip and caption sampling? Do you perform any preprocessing or padding on the clips or captions?

Leveraging the proposed soft-maximum operator, we employ the log-sum-exp approximation to identify the crucial words or key frames for each frame or word, respectively. Following this, we average these soft-maximum similarities across all frames or words to establish the clip-caption similarity. This innovative approach ensures that the similarity between the clip and caption with different lengths can be effortlessly computed, facilitating seamless integration into the subsequent optimal transport sequential alignment process. In summary, the soft-maximum operator effectively addresses the challenge posed by variable lengths in clips and captions.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'The Response to Reviewer 83JB (Part 1/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': '## \n\nThanks a lot for reviewing our paper and giving us valuable suggestions.

Specifically, we initiate training by exclusively utilizing the clip-caption contrastive loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{clip}}$. This initial focus on clip/caption pairs enhances the quality of their representations before introducing the video-paragraph contrastive loss. \n\nIn our implementation, we build our network directly on top of the VideoCLIP checkpoint (trained with the clip-caption contrastive loss) and effectively reduce computational resources. Experimental results underscore the substantial performance improvement of our method over VideoCLIP in various long and short video tasks, achieved with only 1 GPU day of post-training.\n\n> ***Question 2:** The paper does not compare the proposed method with other methods that use optimal transport for sequence alignment, such as Su & Hua (2017).

Su & Hua (2017) introduce an optimal transport method for sequence matching by incorporating two novel regularization terms. These terms, namely inverse difference moment regularization and KL divergence with a prior distribution regularization, aim to encourage transports to nearby instances and penalize alignments between distant instances. \n\nWe have re-implemented Su & Hua (2017) in the context of video learning and evaluated it on the YouCookII dataset.

We are prepared to address your questions one by one.\n\n> ***Question 1:** While the authors effectively illustrate the motivation in Fig. 1, the advantages of the proposed OT method over DTW require more elaboration. It is advisable to include further discussions to expound upon and clarify the claims made regarding the superiority of OT over DTW.*\n\nThe advantages of our proposed Optimal Transport (OT) method over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) are multi-faceted, as detailed below.\n\n1. **Integration of multi-grained correspondence learning.** Our method tackles both coarse-grained and fine-grained misalignment within a unified OT framework from a fine-to-coarse perspective. In contrast, DTW predominantly focuses on the single-grained level.\n2. **Suitability for non-monotonic alignment.** DTW aligns sequences following chronological order, limiting its ability to handle non-monotonic alignment cases. For instance, while DTW may align $\\mathbf{t}_4$ with $\\mathbf{v}_6$, it cannot align $\\mathbf{t}_5$ with $\\mathbf{v}_4$ and $\\mathbf{v}_5$ simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 1. In contrast, our OT-based method is inherently flexible in addressing such scenarios.\n3. **Handling of irrelevant misalignments.** DTW may erroneously align irrelevant clips and captions, such as aligning $\\mathbf{t}_2$ with $\\mathbf{v}_3$ in Fig. 1. Our method mitigates this challenge by introducing an alignment prompt bucket within the OT framework, effectively filtering out meaningless clips and captions.\n4. **Robustness to sequence lengths.** OT demonstrates inherent robustness to variations in sequence lengths, which is a key distinction from DTW. The constraint terms on transport assignment $\\mathbf{Q}$ in Eq. (2) ensure a fixed total mass (i.e., distance) regardless of the number of clips or captions. This characteristic makes our method well-suited for real-world applications with variational video lengths.\n\nThese points collectively underline the superiority of our method over DTW in video-text learning and emphasize its robustness in handling diverse alignment challenges. Additionally, we placed **visual comparison results** between our method and DTW in Appendix G. We encourage reviewers to refer to the updated manuscript for further details.\n\n\n\n\n\n> ***Question 2:** The use of the stop-gradient operation in transport assignment Q is highlighted by the authors as a means to enhance the efficiency of their video-paragraph contrastive loss. However, the rationale behind this operation's efficacy is not entirely clear. To remedy this, additional discussions should be included to provide a more comprehensive explanation of why this operation is meaningful and how it improves efficiency.*\n\nIn the derivation of the Sinkhorn-Knopp iteration (Appendix B), we observe the necessity for iterative matrix normalization to obtain the transport assignment $\\mathbf{Q}$, defined as:\n\n$$ \\mathbf{Q} =  \\operatorname{Diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_1) \\exp \\left({ \\mathbf{S}}/{\\varepsilon}\\right) \\operatorname{Diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_2),$$\n\nwith iteratively updated scaling vectors $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, calculated as  \n\n $$\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_1 \\leftarrow \\boldsymbol{\\mu} . /\\left(\\exp (\\mathbf{S} / \\varepsilon) \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_2\\right), ~\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_2 \\leftarrow \\boldsymbol{\\nu} . /\\left(\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{S}^{\\top} / \\varepsilon\\right) \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_1\\right),$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{n} \\mathbf{1}_n \\text { and } \\boldsymbol{\\nu}=\\frac{1}{m} \\mathbf{1}_m$ are the uniform probability distributions. Empirically, approximately 50 steps of the iterative updates are necessary to achieve a satisfactory assignment result. Retaining the gradient of $\\mathbf{S}$ during the Sinkhorn iteration would introduce complexity to the backward pass of the video-paragraph contrastive loss. To maintain computational efficiency, we strategically choose to stop the gradient of the transport assignment $\\mathbf{Q}$. This decision streamlines the optimization process and ensures its stability.\n\n> ***Question 3:** To enhance clarity, it is suggested that the authors highlight the second-best results alongside the primary results in each table.*\n\nThanks.

What are the benefits or drawbacks of using OT for video-text learning? Please provide some comparisons and discussions.*\n\n**Benefits and drawbacks of employing Optimal Transport (OT).** Our work specifically concentrates on learning temporal correspondence from long videos and addresses the challenges posed by noisy correspondence, as illustrated in Fig. 1 of the manuscript. The benefits of leveraging OT in video-text learning are evident in its inherent ability to address *asynchronous misalignment and one-to-many alignment* issues, e.g., text $\\mathbf{t}_3$ is originally aligned with $\\mathbf{v}_3$  but should be realigned with both $\\mathbf{v}_4$ and $\\mathbf{v}_5$  in Fig. 1. However, OT comes with certain drawbacks in this context, \n\n1. Fine-Grained Alignment. OT estimates sequence distance based on clip-caption similarity, leaving the fine-grained word-frame misalignment problem unexplored.\n2. Strict Instance Mapping. OT requires each source instance to exactly map to the targets, which is impractical when dealing with a large amount of meaningless text.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, our proposed method introduces a soft-maximum operator for fine-grained alignment and an alignment prompt bucket to filter out meaningless clips and captions within the OT framework. **These unique components distinguish our method from previous OT-based methods**, enabling the effective handling of noisy correspondence and achieving superior results in video understanding.\n\n**Comparisons with other OT-based methods**. We compared our method with OT-based sequence matching methods, specifically Su & Hua (2017) [ref.B] and Liu et al. (2022) [ref.C]. Su & Hua (2017) introduce an OT method for action sequence matching with novel temporal regularization terms, aiming to encourage transports to nearby instances and penalize alignments between distant instances. Liu et al. (2022) also propose temporal priors on the optimal transport. \n\nWe re-implemented Su & Hua (2017) in the context of video learning and evaluated it on the YouCookII dataset. The table below presents results for clip-caption retrieval (marked as ""Clip""), video-paragraph retrieval with video backgrounds (marked as ""Video (w B)""), and video-paragraph retrieval without video backgrounds (marked as ""Video (w/o B)""). Notably, our proposed Norton outperforms Su & Hua (2017) by a significant margin in both short and long video retrieval tasks. As Liu et al. (2022) did not provide the training code, we compared our method with Liu et al. (2022) on the action segmentation dataset COIN based on its reported results. Specifically, we achieved a frame-wise accuracy of 69.8, while Liu et al.

It would be beneficial if the authors could provide more detailed numerical results or analysis on this aspect in their rebuttal or future work.*\n\nThank you for the suggestions. To address the concerns regarding the noisy correspondence, we have conducted an evaluation using the HTM-Align dataset [ref.A] and included the results in Appendix D. HTM-Align is a subset of the HowTo100M dataset, consisting of 80 videos with 49K sentences that have been **manually annotated to rectify the alignment** in the presence of noisy correspondence. The annotators have two main tasks: i) determining if a sentence from ASR is visually related to the video, and ii) adjusting the start \\& end timestamps to accurately cover the visual content if the sentence is related. \n\nAfter training the models on the HowTo100M dataset, we evaluated their performance on this alignment task to assess their ability to handle noise. We report the recall metrics for this alignment task. Specifically, for a **misaligned sentence**, if its most closely matched video frame falls into the ground-truth segment annotated by the human, it is counted as a successful recall. We employ a sliding window approach to calculate the similarity between video frames and sentences with a window size of 32 seconds and a step size of 8 seconds. We averaged the similarity scores for overlapping visual tokens from multiple windows. \n\nAs shown below, CLIP exhibits inferior performance, possibly because it has only been trained on images and lacks the ability to capture video dynamics. In contrast, our method outperforms VideoCLIP and TempCLR, providing evidence that our approach is not prone to fit noisy correspondence. \n\n| Approach                               |  Recall  |\n| :------------------------------------- | :------: |\n| CLIP (ViT-B/32) (Radford et al., 2021) |   17.5   |\n| MIL-NCE (Miech et al., 2020)           |   34.2   |\n| TAN (Han et al., 2022)                 |   41.1   |\n| VideoCLIP (Xu et al., 2021)            |   44.4   |\n| TempCLR (Yang et al., 2023)            |   44.1   |\n| Norton (Ours)                          | **46.9** |\n\n[A] Tengda Han, Weidi Xie, and Andrew Zisserman.

In contrast, R@10 provides a broader perspective and may be less critical, as users typically focus on the top few results in practical scenarios.

The following points address these aspects and are included in Appendix F.\n\n1. **Multi-modal scenarios**. Our approach introduces an optimal transport solution to address the noisy correspondence between bi-modalities in videos and text. However, as videos inherently encompass visual, textual, and audio content, the noisy correspondence challenge might extend across multiple modalities. Addressing multi-modal noisy correspondence using optimal transport presents an open challenge, given the quadratic growth in combinations concerning the number of modalities. We acknowledge this limitation and plan to extend our method to effectively tackle multi-modal noisy correspondence, exploring these scenarios in future work.\n2. **Utilization of Noise.** In this paper, we employ the prompt bucket to directly filter out irrelevant clips and captions during sequential alignment, attempting to mitigate the influence of noisy correspondence. However, an intriguing question arises regarding whether these noisy samples could be utilized as an incentive for training. Exploring the possibility of generating associated text for unalignable video clips using large multimodal models (LMMs), e.g., LLaVA and GPT-4V (vision), could open up a novel avenue for exploration and improvement in future research endeavors. \n\n\n\n> ***Question 4:**  Could you provide more detailed implementation details, including hyperparameter settings, training procedures, and computational resources?*\n\nComprehensive implementation details including hyperparameter settings, training procedures, and computational resources are available in Appendix A. Additionally, detailed training costs for several variants of our method are provided in Appendix C.

We will answer the questions one by one.\n\n>  ***Question 1:** Could you provide more details on the design choices behind the Norton method, specifically the alignable prompt bucket and the soft-maximum operator?*\n\nThis work focuses on learning temporal correspondence from long videos, particularly addressing the challenges posed by multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC). As illustrated in Fig. 1 of the manuscript, MNC encompasses both coarse-grained (clip-caption) misalignment and fine-grained misalignment (frame-word). The design choices of our method are closely linked to addressing this daunting challenge.\n\n- **Overall framework.** The overall design is motivated by the phenomenon of coarse-grained asynchronous misalignment. For instance, in Fig. 1, text $\\mathbf{t}_3$ is originally aligned with $\\mathbf{v}_3$  but it should be realigned with both $\\mathbf{v}_4$ and $\\mathbf{v}_5$. Leveraging optimal transport (OT) is key as it naturally handles these **asynchronous and one-to-many alignment** challenges. To further address fine-grained misalignment and coarse-grained irrelevant misalignment, we integrate the soft-maximum operator and alignable prompt bucket into the OT framework.\n- **Soft-maximum operator.** This component is designed to identify crucial words and key frames in fine-grained frame-word alignment. As depicted in Fig. 1, only certain words in a caption are relevant to the associated video clip. Therefore, we employ the **log-sum-exp approximation** as the soft-maximum operator to identify the most significant words for each frame based on fine-grained frame-word interaction. This operator computes the clip-caption similarity for subsequent coarse-grained sequence alignment, unifying multi-grained correspondence learning within the OT framework.\n- **Alignable prompt bucket.** This component is designed to filter out irrelevant clips and captions during coarse-grained clip-caption alignment. The prompt bucket serves as a candidate alignable target for irrelevant clips and captions. The value $p$ of the bucket functions as the **similarity margin** that distinguishes between alignable and unalignable clips and captions. If a video clip lacks an alignable caption, its pairwise similarities with the set of captions are typically small. During Sinkhorn iterations, if the margin $p$ significantly exceeds these pairwise similarity values, the video clip aligns with the prompt bucket. By discarding clips/captions aligned to the prompt bucket, Norton effectively filters out noisy clips and captions, enhancing the overall alignment results.\n\n\n\n> ***Questions 2 and 5:** Could you elaborate on the potential implications and applications of the Norton method in real-world scenarios? Could you elaborate on specific scenarios or cases where Norton particularly excels or struggles?*\n\nThanks for the suggestions. We have included a section on the potential implications and applications of Norton in real-world scenarios in Appendix E for your reference. Below is the newly added content.\n\n**Application scenarios.** Norton is a representation learning method that exhibits versatility across various tasks including video retrieval, video QA, and classification, as confirmed by our experiments. A notable strength of Norton lies in its ability to effectively address the common challenge of noisy correspondence, particularly in **uncurated instructional videos**. This adaptability allows Norton to be implemented in diverse scenarios without necessitating meticulous video curation. For instance, Norton proves effective in tasks such as long video retrieval or classification for various content genres like movies, education videos, and cooking tutorials. It's also essential to acknowledge that Norton is tailored for representation learning and may exhibit suboptimal performance in tasks focused on content generation, such as video captioning.\n\n**Potential implications.** This paper delves into two challenging problems in video understanding, namely, long video learning and noisy correspondence learning.  In addressing the former, where computational constraints have limited prior works, our proposed efficient solution may spark increased interest in long video understanding tasks. Regarding the latter, the **noisy correspondence (mismatched data pairs)** problem has garnered attention in diverse multi-modal applications, extending **beyond video-text domains** to encompass challenges in image-text retrieval, cross-modal generation, and person re-identification. Our work has the potential to attract increased attention to the broader spectrum of noisy correspondence challenges across various domains.""}}, {'summary': {'value': 'The paper introduces NOise Robust Temporal Optimal traNsport (Norton), a method designed to address multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) in video-language studies, particularly focusing on long-term temporal dependencies in long videos.

To be specific, MNC refers to the clip-caption misalignment (coarse-grained) and frame-word misalignment (fine-grained), hindering temporal learning and video understanding. In this paper, we propose NOise Robust Temporal Optimal traNsport (Norton) that addresses MNC in a unified optimal transport (OT) framework. In brief, Norton employs video-paragraph and clip-caption contrastive losses to capture long-term dependencies based on OT. To address coarse-grained misalignment in video-paragraph contrast, Norton filters out the irrelevant clips and captions through an alignable prompt bucket and realigns asynchronous clip-caption pairs based on transport distance.

In this paper, we propose DreamGaussian, a novel 3D content generation framework that achieves both efficiency and quality simultaneously. Our key insight is to design a generative 3D Gaussian Splatting model with companioned mesh extraction and texture refinement in UV space.In contrast to the occupancy pruning used in Neural Radiance Fields, we demonstrate that the progressive densification of 3D Gaussians converges significantly faster for 3D generative tasks.To further enhance the texture quality and facilitate downstream applications, we introduce an efficient algorithm to convert 3D Gaussians into textured meshes and apply a fine-tuning stage to refine the details.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive generation quality of our proposed approach.Notably, DreamGaussian produces high-quality textured meshes in just 2 minutes from a single-view image, achieving approximately 10 times acceleration compared to existing methods.",Oral 7B,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=UyNXMqnN3c,https://openreview.net/forum?id=UyNXMqnN3c,UyNXMqnN3c,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'The paper has received unanimous recommendations for acceptance with ratings of 8/8/10/8.

Since image-to-3D has a strong reference view image prior, we don\'t observe obvious instability during training.\n\nFor text-to-3D, we have updated new text-to-3D results using MVDream [1] as the guidance model in the appendix. An ablation study shows that timestep annealing is still helpful in generating a more reasonable shape with the same amount of training iterations. However, we do observe that different input prompts may require different number of training iterations to converge, so a linear annealing may not be the optimal way.\n\n\n\n**Q2: In the refinement stage, what happens if the image-to-image diffusion changes the object boundary? How to prevent the color from background leaking into mesh?**\n\nSince we use a relatively small noise level for image-to-image diffusion, boundary change is not very obvious. Also, since the optimization is performed from multiple camera views, it could be corrected from another view should any color leaking happened in one view.\n\n\n\n**Q3: Comparison of the texture refinement stage with texture generation methods like Texfusion and Text2tex.**\n\nThanks for reminding us! Although we both generate texture on a fixed mesh geometry, there are several differences:\n\n(1) These methods require a text prompt as the input. However, we don\'t have a prompt in our image-to-3D setting.\n\n(2) We have a coarse texture and we want to enhance the details based on it.

We are not the first to choose this design, as Fantasia3D [2] also adopts a solid background color during optimization. \n\nThe learnable background model is majorly adopted in NeRF-based method. One possible explanation is that NeRF tends to form the background during early optimization, which is undesired since we want NeRF to form the target object. However, we observe that it\'s less likely for mesh or Gaussian-based method with explicit geometry to form the background, so a learnable background model is unnecessary.\n\n\n\n[1] Shi, Yichun, et al.

Our paper does focus more on image-to-3D, since text-to-3D generation takes longer computing time and is more prone to suffer from the Jasus problem.\n\nAs stated in the limitations, it\'s promising to solve the Janus problem with recent multi-view or camera-conditioned 2D diffusion models. We have updated new text-to-3D results using MVDream [1] as the guidance model in the appendix, which shows better results for difficult prompts.\n\n\n\n**Q2: What is the advantage of the proposed refinement stage compared to Fantasia3D?**\n\nThe key advantage of our refinement stage lies in its efficiency.\n\nUnlike other methods, which typically start without initial textures and require considerable time for generation, our approach builds on an existing mesh with coarse textures. For example, the texturing stage in Fantasia3D can take up to 20 minutes using 8 GPUs, whereas our refinement stage enhances the coarse texture in just 1 minute on a single GPU.\n\n\n\n**Q3: Differences compared to GSGEN which optimizes for longer time.**\n\nThere are several different designs that lead to the different conclusions about optimization time:\n\n(1) GSGEN prioritizes high-quality text-to-3D generation, which is more challenging than image-to-3D. To address the Janus problem, they also generate a point cloud using Point-E [2] to initialize the Gaussians.\n\n(2) They introduce a novel compactness-based densification strategy, which is more suitable for longer optimization. \n\n(3) In addition to the 2D SDS loss using Stable-diffusion, GSGEN applies a 3D SDS loss with Point-E [2], potentially prolonging each optimization step.\n\nIn contrast, our method emphasizes efficiency, trading off some level of detail. We also observe that text-to-3D typically requires longer optimization to achieve finer details, especially with an appropriate densification strategy.\n\n\n\n[1] Shi, Yichun, et al.

Typically, image-to-3D results involve around $10^4$ 3D Gaussians, while text-to-3D can reach up to $10^5$ Gaussians due to a more aggressive densification strategy.\n\nFor the mesh extraction, we apply remeshing and decimation as post-processing so the size is controlled. Specifically, we perform isotropic remeshing to an average edge length of $0.015$, and then decimate the number of faces to $10^5$.\n\nThe primary computational bottleneck in our pipeline remains the forwarding of the 2D diffusion model. We have broken down the time consumption for each operation per iteration as follows:\n\n| Operation | Render 3D Gaussians | Run diffusion model | Loss backward |\n| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |\n| Time (ms) | 3.8                 | 58.4                | 26.4          |\n\nOur method primarily reduces generation time by requiring fewer iterations to converge (from several thousand to 500 steps). However, each iteration is still constrained by the 2D diffusion model.\n\nFor the mesh extraction, the time consumption for each operation is detailed as:\n\n| Operation | Extract geometry | Unwarp UV | Extract texture |\n| --------- | ---------------- | --------- | --------------- |\n| Time (s)  | 7.9              | 4.6       | 4.0             |\n\n\n\n**Q2: How to control the mesh complexity? How to solve non-watertight/manifold meshes?**\n\nAs mentioned in response to Q1, we control mesh complexity through post-processing, limiting the number of faces to $10^5$ through decimation. These post-processing details have been added to the implementation details.\n\nWe acknowledge the potential for non-manifold or non-watertight meshes in cases of poor Gaussian convergence, but we consider repairing it is less related to the goal of this paper and leave it for future work.\n\n\n\n**Q3: The size of user study is limited.**\n\nThanks for the advice!

We follow Dreamtime [2] to perform an annealing of  $t$ from $0.98$ to $0.02$ during training, which leads to faster convergence as shown in the ablation study (Figure 7).\n\n\n\n**Q3: How to perform the linear timestep decreasing?**\n\nAs answered in Q2, we linearly decrease $t$ from $0.98$ to $0.02$ with iteration step $i$ during training. \n\nThis can be viewed a simplification of the TP-SDS algorithm proposed in Dreamtime [2]. Their findings suggest that larger values of $t$ are crucial for the global structure, whereas smaller values enhance local details.

However, it would be great if the authors could also reference methods like Perp-Neg [3] or Prompt-Debiasing [4] that address the Janus problem without the need for 3D assets. This has significant importance because they don\'t introduce bias from 3D data into the pipeline. For instance, they allow for the generation of a dog without the strict square position for standing that comes from the 3D asset.\nIt would be great if the authors could also comment on the guidance of the SDS loss and the effect of increasing those values.\n\nThere are many typos in the paper, and it would be great if the authors could fix them. Examples are: on page 2, ""Gaussian splitting"" appears to be a typo; it should likely be ""Gaussian splatting"". âseverl methodsâ on page 3 and âDissusionâ on page 5 is it supposed to be discussion?\n\nIt would also be great if the authors could comment on how to get the model to consider both the input image and the text prompt simultaneously in both the initial stage and the later mesh/texture optimization stage. At the moment, it seems to ignore the optional text prompt. Was this intentional?\n\nThe paper contrary to DreamFusion does not learn an MLP for the background, it would be great if authors could comment on why they made that choice and what are their findings. \n\n[1] https://openaccess.thecvf.com//content/ICCV2023/papers/Cao_TexFusion_Synthesizing_3D_Textures_with_Text-Guided_Image_Diffusion_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf\n\n[2]https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Chen_Text2Tex_Text-driven_Texture_Synthesis_via_Diffusion_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf\n\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04968\n\n[4] https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15413'}, 'questions': {'value': 'Please consider the comments in the weaknesses section.

However, existing privacy auditing techniques usually make strong assumptions on the adversary (e.g., knowledge of intermediate model iterates or the training data distribution), are tailored to specific tasks, model architectures, or DP algorithm, and/or require retraining the model many times (typically on the order of thousands). These shortcomings make deploying such techniques at scale difficult in practice, especially in federated settings where model training can take days or weeks. In this work, we present a novel âone-shotâ approach that can systematically address these challenges, allowing efficient auditing or estimation of the privacy loss of a model during the same, single training run used to fit model parameters, and without requiring any a priori knowledge about the model architecture, task, or DP algorithm.

This can be written equivalently as $\\hat{\\varepsilon} \\leftarrow \\varepsilon(\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\ ||\\ \\mathcal{N}(\\sqrt{d} \\hat{\\mu}, d \\hat{\\sigma}^2); \\delta)$, because it is just a scaling of both distributions by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{d}$, which does not change the $\\varepsilon$. Note that the function $\\varepsilon$ depends only on $\\hat{\\mu}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ -- nothing else about the samples. Now Theorem 3.3 demonstrates that $\\sqrt{d}\\hat{\\mu} \\overset{p}{\\longrightarrow} 1/\\sigma$ and $d\\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\overset{p}{\\longrightarrow} 1$. Therefore by the Mann-Wald theorem, the estimate converges in probability to $\\varepsilon (\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\ ||\\ \\mathcal{N}(1 / \\sigma, 1); \\delta)$. Now these two distributions are just a scaling of $A(D) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ and $A(D') \\sim \\mathcal{N}(1, \\sigma^2)$ by a factor of $1 / \\sigma$, so the $\\varepsilon$ is the same as the mechanism we are auditing (see the first paragraph of Sec. 3). This proves our claim. We will rewrite the last paragraph on page 4 to include this argument.\n\nWe emphasize again that it is not essential that the cosines $g_i$ actually *be* Gaussian distributed for this argument to hold. Adding a proof that they are truly Gaussian might aid our intuition, but it is not necessary if what we are most concerned about is correctness of the algorithmâ that it outputs the correct $\\varepsilon$. Also we want to be clear that it would not be sufficient to show that each cosine sample is marginally Gaussian (which would be relatively easy to show). To see this, note that If we proved only that much, it could pathologically be the case that all of the samples are always identical to each other on each run (but Gaussian distributed across runs) so that the empirical variance on any run is zero. Then our method would be broken.

Without loss of generality, let the reference vector $v$ be $(1,0, \\ldots, 0)$.

And there are two reasonable answers. 1) Because the samples really are (asymptotically, independently) Gaussian distributed. 2) Because by doing so, we recover the correct $\\varepsilon$. Our intuition is that 1) is true. We have experimental evidence by looking at histograms of the samples. We agree that it would be odd if the samples were not Gaussian distributed, but fitting a Gaussian to them somehow coincidentally produced the correct $\\varepsilon$. However, proving 1) is not necessary for the algorithm to be correct; proving 2) is sufficient, and that is what we have done.

You addressed many of my concerns and questions, but I still have a few remaining ones.\n\n> In Theorem 3.1, we could give a formula for the value of the measure of the spherical cap $A_d(\\theta)$, but it is actually not necessary. Since we are interested in the rate of change of $A_d(\\theta)$ with respect to $\\theta$, all we need is the measure of its boundary: as $\\theta$ increases, $A_d(\\theta)$ increases by an amount that is proportional to the measure of its boundary, which is a $(d-1)$-sphere of radius $\\sin \\theta$.\n\n~~I still don\'t fully follow this argument. I see that when $A_d$ and $M_d$ are written in terms of the radius $r$, $A_d(r) = C_1r^{d-1}$ and $M_d(r) = C_2r^{d-2}$, so $\\frac{d}{dr}A_d(r) = (d-1)C_1 r^{d-2} \\propto M_d(r)$, like you wrote.

The claim is clear when $d = 3$, but in higher dimensions it is not trivial to prove. \n\n> All of that said, we would like to emphasize that it is not necessary to completely characterize their distribution in order to prove the main result of Section 3 (asymptotic correctness of Algorithm 1).

Please see our second comment to reviewer LDHu for those results, which we will add to the paper. But we emphasize that our method is not really designed for such small models.\n* *What is the conclusion of Appendix F?* We discussed this in the third bullet above.\n* *How could one extend this method to other privacy mechanisms other than Gaussian?* This is a very interesting question. Probably the canary distribution would have to change. For example, for the Laplace mechanism maybe the canaries could be sampled from the set of vectors of unit L1 norm. But to be honest we have not thought much about this, since the Gaussian mechanism is the building block of DP-FedAvg and its variants. We will mention this as an interesting open question in our conclusion.\n\nHave we answered all of your questions? Do you have any other concerns we could address to merit a higher score? Thank you.'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""We appreciate your careful review and suggestions to improve our paper. We believe we can answer most of your concerns.\n\n* *Using canary clients seems more inefficient compared to using canary examples. More resource allocation might be needed.* The reason to use canary clients, as opposed to canary examples, is that we are estimating user-level DP. We need to measure the impact on the model of adding or removing an entire client. Using canary examples would only give an estimate of example-level DP. In any case, resource allocation should not be an issue; if anything it requires fewer resources to forego training on some clientâs data and replace its entire update with a canary, vs. replacing one of its example gradients with a canary (of the same dimensionality) and performing local training.\n* *Wouldnât replacing some usersâ data destroy their representation and result in fairness problems?* Itâs true that a small fraction of usersâ data would be lost. In our stackoverflow dataset there were 341k users. In the production DP-FL-trained language models of Xu et al. (2023), there are more than 3M users for almost all of the languages. If we replaced 1k of those users with canaries, we would lose 0.033% of the data. Because the users would be sampled uniformly at random from the population (for example, by hashing on a user ID), it seems to us there should not be a fairness problem, even in the data heterogenous setting. If there is a definition of fairness that would be violated, we would be interested in hearing about it so we could discuss a different strategy (e.g., augmenting the dataset with canary users, rather than swapping real users with canary users). The advantage of replacing usersâ data, as stated in the paper, is that it guarantees that the canary client participation is exactly according to the natural distribution.\n* *It is hard to interpret the provided empirical comparison with CANIFE.* We agree, the primary advantages of our method with respect to CANIFE are that it makes fewer assumptions and is easier to implement. Although CANIFE is billed as an empirical privacy âmeasurementâ, not a lower bound, it uses a lower bound to audit individual rounds. We believe this causes the estimates it produces to be on the low side. The experiment shows that our estimate is closer to the analytical upper bound. Also, CANIFE's estimate is lower because it attempts to craft a canary example whose gradient is nearly orthogonal to the gradients of a small auxiliary set of examples. In contrast, we use canary updates that are provably nearly orthogonal to the true updates, leading to a stronger attack.\n* *The authors claim that their method is agnostic to architecture knowledge, but aren't the $c_j$ of the same dimension as the architecture?* Yes, the dimensionality of the model architecture must be known. Being agnostic to all other aspects of model architecture means that it is easy to add an empirical privacy estimation module to an existing FL system: when the system trains a model, all the EPE module needs to do is insert random canary vectors during training (which, of course, must be of the appropriate dimensionality). This is in contrast to CANIFE, for example, which requires an architecture-specific method and in-distribution auxiliary training data to design canary examples, which is completely different for continuous or discrete data.\n* *Why is there not a dependence on $k/n$ in Theorem 1-3?* (You wrote $m$, but we assume you meant $n$. Actually this is a good reminder that it is confusing that we used $m$ in section 5. We will unify the notation. Thank you.) Theorems 3.1-3 deal with the case where $d$ becomes large. So long as $d$ asymptotically dominates both $k$ and $n$, the ratio $k/n$ should not matter. In high dimensions, the canaries become orthogonal to all real data vectors and to each other, no matter how many there are.\n* *In Table 2 what is the goal of comparing to $\\varepsilon_\\text{lo}$, and what is the conclusion?* As discussed in the second paragraph of Sec. 5, the modified Jagielski et al. method in the table provides a lower bound on the true $\\varepsilon$, but is statistically limited by the number of samples, so that it cannot give very high values. In this case it cannot go higher than 6.24, where the empirical false negative rate is 0. We include it to show that a) our method does not suffer from this limitation, and b) even when the value is below 6.24, our method is not falsified by the lower bound.

We believe we can answer most of your concerns.\n\n* *In the experiments conducted the number of canaries used is quite large, which is likely to have an impact on the model utility.* We stated in the paper that for our Stackoverflow experiments, with 341k clients, âacross the range of noise multipliers, the participation of 1k canaries had no significant impact on model accuracy â at most causing a 0.1% relative decreaseâ. (In fact, in an earlier draft we included a table comparing the accuracies, but since they are essentially unchanged, we thought the table was not helpful and wrote that sentence instead. To make this more clear to readers, we will add the table to the appendix.) There are many practical FL problems in which the number of real clients is high enough that adding 1000 canary clients will have negligible effect on model utility. For a real world benchmark, see Xu et al. (2023), which trains language models using DP-FL in a variety of languages, almost all of which have more than 3M clients each â ten times more than in our experiments.\n* *The example analyzed in Table 1 assumes a high dimension as well as a large number of canaries, which is not particularly realistic. The authors should provide similar analysis for lower values of d and k.* Many models of practical interest these days have more (often *far* more) than 1M parameters, including both of the benchmarks used in our experiments, and the industry language models cited above. We grant that our method would not be useful for small models, but 1M parameters is not very high by contemporary deep learning standards.\n* *The values of epsilon used are very high and additional experiments should be performed with values of epsilon such as 0.1, 1, 5 and 10.* One of the key points of our paper is that the analytical $\\varepsilon$ vastly overstates the true privacy risk of releasing only the final model parameters. Notice that even at our smallest analytical $\\varepsilon$ of 30, the empirical estimate $\\varepsilon_\\text{est}$-final is already less than 1. Look also at the density plots in the rightmost plot of Figure 1 corresponding to analytical $\\varepsilon$ = 30, in which the canary cosine distributions are almost visually indistinguishable from the null hypothesis distribution. It is clear that adding even more noise to achieve lower values of analytical $\\varepsilon$ would only lead to even more miniscule values of $\\varepsilon_\\text{est}$-all and $\\varepsilon_\\text{est}$-final, while destroying model utility. We would also point out that if the analytical $\\varepsilon$ were as low as 1 or 0.1, we would have a theoretical guarantee of very strong privacy, so it would not be useful to employ our method to compute an empirical privacy estimate. Therefore we donât think there is value in training models under such high levels of noise. We will add the statement of this reasoning to the text.\n* *The difference between user-level and example-level differential privacy should be discussed and defined more clearly within the context of federated learning.* We assume that DP-FedAvg would be used for user-level DP, and that DP-SGD would be used if only example-level DP is desired. It is conceivable that FedAvg could be modified somehow to achieve only example-level DP, but we feel that would be a strange thing to do, since user-level DP is the stronger form. When we note in the paper (footnote, page 1) that our approach can be modified to provide example-level DP, meaning that the key insight of using random nearly-mutually-orthogonal canaries carries over from DP-FedAvg to DP-SGD by using the canary vectors as example gradients instead of user updates. We will amend that footnote to be more explicit about the âtrivial modificationâ required.\n* *Experiments with a varying number of clients should also be conducted.* As we argued above, there are many practical FL problems in which the number of real clients is high enough that adding 1000 canary clients will have negligible effect on model utility. We could run experiments with only a subset of the clients from our benchmark datasets, but the only result would be that the model utility would be lower.\n\nHave we answered all of your questions?

You make some excellent points about the difficulty of comparing two empirical privacy estimates, which we will address in a subsequent comment. In the interest of getting the conversation started during this short review period, we will address the rest of your comments first. You said your other main concern and reason for your rating is regarding the proofs. Please let us elucidate that for you here.\n\nIn Theorem 3.1, we could give a formula for the value of the measure of the spherical cap $A_d(\\theta)$, but it is actually not necessary. Since we are interested in the rate of change of $A_d(\\theta)$ with respect to $\\theta$, all we need is the measure of its boundary: as $\\theta$ increases, $A_d(\\theta)$ increases by an amount that is proportional to the measure of its boundary, which is a $(d-1)$-sphere of radius $\\sin \\theta$. The measure of a hypersphere of radius $R$ can be found, for example, here https://zhangyk8.github.io/teaching/file/Exercise_4_insight.pdf. We can clarify and add a footnote to the proof citing this reference.\n\nWe apologize for the difficulty in following the proof of Theorem 3.2 and we appreciate your suggestions to clarify it. We will clearly define $\\hat{f}_d(t)$ to be the density function of $\\tau \\sqrt{d}$ (where $\\tau$ is defined in Theorem 3.1). We will properly cite Scheffeâs Theorem, which is the result that pointwise convergence of the density function implies convergence in distribution. As for your other comment, strictly speaking, the density of $\\tau \\sqrt{d}$ is defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, but it is equal to 0 outside of $-[\\sqrt{d}, \\sqrt{d}]$. Since $\\sqrt{d} \\rightarrow \\infty$ as $d$ increases, the pointwise limit holds for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We will amend the formula for $\\hat{f}_d(t)$ to show how it is defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWe hope that completely addresses your concerns about the proofs.\n\nOther questions:\n* *Is the distribution of the test statistic in Theorem 3.3 (asymptotically) Gaussian?* We noticed just now that we misstated in the paper at the bottom of page 4 that the distribution of the test statistic is Gaussian. We apologize for that mistake and we will correct it. In fact, there are some tricky subtleties here: since the test statistics are not independent, we need to make some statement about their joint distribution, for example, that the joint distribution approaches the product of independent Gaussians. While it would be surprising if that were not the case, we donât currently have a proof. All of that said, we would like to emphasize that it is not necessary to completely characterize their distribution in order to prove the main result of Section 3 (asymptotic correctness of Algorithm 1). Algorithm 1 depends only on the empirical mean and variance of the canary cosines, which Theorem 3.3 proves are asymptotically correct.\n* *What are the upper bounds for the confidence intervals in Table 2? It looks like the intervals are huge in the -all columns.* As discussed in the second paragraph of Sec. 5, $\\varepsilon_\\text{lo}$ is not strictly speaking a lower confidence bound on our $\\varepsilon_\\text{est}$. It is a modified version of the Jagielski et al. method. This method provides a lower bound on $\\varepsilon$, but is statistically limited by the number of samples, so that it cannot give very high values. In this case it cannot go higher than 6.24, where the empirical false negative rate is 0. We include it to show that a) our method does not suffer from this limitation, and b) even when the value is below 6.24, our method is not falsified by the lower bound.\n* *Which plots correspond to which canary levels in Figure 1 and which epsilons in Figure 2?* The subplots in Figs 1 and 2 correspond 1:1 from left to right, but we agree this will be clearer if we add epsilon labels to the subplots, which we will do.\n* *Is it possible to use your method to audit standard DP-SGD? If so, how does the method compare to other auditing methods? For example, do the other methods require more than one training run?* Certainly, there is nothing about our method that would prevent it from being used for DP-SGD (we allude to this in the first footnote). It would have the same advantages relative to most other methods (which indeed generally require more than one run). Our method of generating a nearly-mutually-orthogonal set of gradient canaries can also be combined with the recent technique of Steinke et al. to obtain a formal lower bound on DP-SGDâs epsilon in one training run.\n* *Regarding the challenge to find an attack that breaks your methodâ¦* You are correct that our method (like all work in empirical privacy auditing) would not detect breaches of differential privacy from attacks exploiting not using a cryptographically secure source of randomness, or the finite precision of floating point numbers. We will be more explicit in the conclusion that our method is not designed to detect such attacks.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'This paper proposes an approach for auditing the privacy of differentially-private learning algorithm in the context of federated learning such as DP-FedAvg.

The first is not using a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the Gaussian noise, which would allow an attacker to remove the noise if they can break the insecure RNG. The second is an attack based on finite-precision issues with floating point numbers (see Mironov 2012 and Holohan and Braghin 2021), if the noise is not sampled with defenses against these in place. I don\'t think your method would detect these, as it is only looking at the noise as a real number, and detecting either scenario seems to require looking at the noise as a finite-precision float. Of course, your method is not designed to detect anything like these in the first place, and I don\'t think any of alternatives are either, so this is not a large limitation, but it should still be mentioned.\n\nReferences:\n- N.

Although existing attribution solutions can effectively assign importance to target elements, they still face the following challenges: 1) existing attribution methods generate inaccurate small regions thus misleading the direction of correct attribution, and 2) the model cannot produce good attribution results for samples with wrong predictions. To address the above challenges, this paper re-models the above image attribution problem as a submodular subset selection problem, aiming to enhance model interpretability using fewer regions. To address the lack of attention to local regions, we construct a novel submodular function to discover more accurate small interpretation regions. To enhance the attribution effect for all samples, we also impose four different constraints on the selection of sub-regions, i.e., confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores, to assess the importance of various subsets. Moreover, our theoretical analysis substantiates that the proposed function is in fact submodular. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA methods on two face datasets (Celeb-A and VGG-Face2) and one fine-grained dataset (CUB-200-2011). For correctly predicted samples, the proposed method improves the Deletion and Insertion scores with an average of 4.9\% and 2.5\% gain relative to HSIC-Attribution.

In image attribution tasks, it is essential to sort all sub-regions in the set $V$ since each sub-region contributes to the prediction. As highlighted in our experimental settings, to effectively validate the attribution effect, the value of $k$ will be specifically set equal to $m$ (the size of the set $V$).\n\nIn Table 2, we presented the average highest confidence evaluation metric across various search ranges. For this, we established four search region ranges: 0-25%, 0-50%, 0-75%, and 0-100%, corresponding to setting $k$ to $0.25m$, $0.5m$, $0.75m$, and $m$, respectively. The experimental results indicate that a larger $k$ value generally yields a higher average highest confidence, although the increase tends to plateau. This is because the highest confidence does not decrease as the search range becomes larger.\n\nTable 2.

For example, $s_{colla.}$. employs a cosine distance metric between the semantic feature vector of the target class $\\boldsymbol{f}_{s}$ and features extracted from the residual regions of the original image when the selected subset of regions $S$ is removed. To the best of my knowledge, maximizing this metric ensures that the collective impact of the selected region is sufficient to generate explainable representations.\n\n**AW4:** Thanks for your helpful suggestion. We explain the objectives of these scores in more detail in Section 4.2.\n\nThe confidence score $s_{\\mathrm{conf.}}$ is designed to distinguish regions from out-of-distribution, ensuring alignment with the InD. Thus, we introduce Evidential Deep Learning to metric the uncertainty of an input sample and compute the confidence score. By incorporating the $s_{\\mathrm{conf.}}$, we can ensure that the selected regions align closely with the In-Distribution (InD).\n\nThe effectiveness score $s_{\\mathrm{eff.}}$ is designed to increase the diversity and improving the overall quality of region selection. Thus, we introduce cosine distance to metric the similarity between different sub-regions. If in the selected subset, the distance between the two nearest sub-regions may be large, indicating that the diversity of its special regions is high. By incorporating the $s_{\\mathrm{eff.}}$, we aim to limit the selection of regions with similar semantic representations.\n\nThe consistency score $s_{\\mathrm{cons.}}$ is designed to ensure a precise selection that aligns closely with our specific semantic goals. Thus, we introduce cosine distance to metric the similarity between the selected region with target semantic feature. By incorporating the $s_{\\mathrm{cons.}}$, our method targets regions that reinforce the desired semantic response.\n\nThe collaboration score $s_{\\mathrm{colla.}}$ is designed to find regions of high collective effect. Such a metric is particularly valuable in the initial stages of the search, highlighting regions essential for sustaining the model's accuracy and reliability. Thus, we introduce cosine distance to metric the similarity between the unselected region with target semantic feature. As a result, the similarity level decreases rapidly, and the selected area has a very high collective effect. By incorporating the $s_{\\mathrm{colla.}}$, our method pinpoints regions whose exclusion markedly affects the model's predictive confidence.\n\nIn the experimental part, we conducted ablation experiments on various combinations of these scores. As shown in Table 3, we observed that using a single score function within the submodular function imposes limitations on attribution faithfulness. The experimental results illustrate that removing any of the four score functions leads to deteriorated Deletion and Insertion scores, thereby confirming the validity of these score functions.\n\nTable 3: Ablation study on components of different score functions of submodular function on the Celeb-A, and CUB-200-2011 validation sets.\n\n| Submodular Function  |                     |                      |                       |         Celeb-A         |        Celeb-A         |      Cub-200-2011       |      Cub-200-2011      |\n| :------------------: | :-----------------: | :------------------: | :-------------------: | :---------------------: | :--------------------: | :---------------------: | :--------------------: |\n| $s_{\\mathrm{conf.}}$ | $s_{\\mathrm{eff.}}$ | $s_{\\mathrm{cons.}}$ | $s_{\\mathrm{colla.}}$ | Deletion ($\\downarrow$) | Insertion ($\\uparrow$) | Deletion ($\\downarrow$) | Insertion ($\\uparrow$) |\n|                      |       $\\surd$       |       $\\surd$        |        $\\surd$        |         0.1074          |         0.5735         |         0.0632          |         0.7169         |\n|       $\\surd$        |                     |       $\\surd$        |        $\\surd$        |         0.1993          |         0.2616         |         0.0623          |         0.7227         |\n|       $\\surd$        |       $\\surd$       |                      |        $\\surd$        |         0.1067          |         0.5712         |         0.0651          |         0.6753         |\n|       $\\surd$        |       $\\surd$       |       $\\surd$        |                       |         0.1088          |         0.5750         |         0.0811          |         0.7090         |\n|       $\\surd$        |       $\\surd$       |       $\\surd$        |        $\\surd$        |       **0.1054**        |       **0.5752**       |       **0.0613**        |       **0.7262**       |\n\ncontinue down""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Official Response to Reviewer kDMz (3/8)'}, 'comment': {'value': '**W3:** Most of the scoring functions like $s_{eff.}$., $s_{cons.}$. etc. rely on cosine similarity or distance metrics which have been studied extensively in literature (Deng et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2018 etc.) but have not been cited in the paper.\n\n**AW3:** Thanks for your helpful suggestion.

Traditional methods (Noroozi & Favaro, 2016; Redmon & Farhadi, 2018) typically divide images into regular patch areas, neglecting the semantic information inherent in different regions. In contrast, our method employs a sub-region division strategy that is informed and guided by an a priori saliency map. Therefore, our method could divide the regions based on their contribution to the prediction. We have shown the attribution performances based on different region divided methods as shown in Table 4.  From the experiment, we observe that the attribution results after introducing a priori saliency map to guide sub-region division are better than dividing image patches regularly.\n\nWe have cited related work and highlighted the differences in the revised manuscript.\n\nTable 4: Impact on whether to use a priori attribution map.\n\n| Method               | Set size $m$ | Celeb-A Deletion ($\\downarrow$) | Celeb-A Insertion ($\\uparrow$) | CUB Deletion ($\\downarrow$) | CUB Insertion ($\\uparrow$) |\n| -------------------- | :----------: | :-----------------------------: | :----------------------------: | :-------------------------: | :------------------------: |\n| Patch $7 \\times 7$   |      49      |             0.1493              |             0.5642             |           0.1061            |           0.6903           |\n| Patch $10 \\times 10$ |     100      |             0.1365              |             0.5459             |           0.1024            |           0.6159           |\n| Patch $14 \\times 14$ |     196      |             0.1284              |             0.5562             |           0.0853            |           0.5805           |\n| +HSIC-Attribution    |      25      |           **0.1054**            |           **0.5752**           |         **0.0613**          |         **0.7262**         |\n\n[Reference A] Mehdi Noroozi and Paolo Favaro.

The higher attribution score indicates the more importance of the decision. Attention in neural networks is the visual similarity between different feature representations, where the higher value only indicates the higher feature similarity. Maybe the attention could be used for image attribution, which we will explore for future work.\n\n----\n\n**Q2:** What is the meaning of fine-grained interpretation regions?\n\n**AQ2:** In this paper, we use the fine-grained interpretation regions to represent the density of the divided image regions, e.g., $7 \\times 7$ and $10 \\times 10$. The HSIC-Attribution (Novello et al., 2022) method typically operates at the $7 \\times 7$ patch level, treating each patch as equally significant. However, when the density of attributed patches increases, say to $10 \\times 10$, its effectiveness in attribution tends to diminish, indicating a limitation. Consequently, in our method, we aim to enhance the density of the divided image regions. This strategy is intended to yield more detailed interpretations when attribution while still maintaining the efficacy of the attribution results.\n\n[Reference] Paul Novello, Thomas Fel, and David Vigouroux.

We aim to express that the proposed function $\\mathcal{F}(\\cdot)$ is a submodular function, characterized by its nonnegative monotonicity and compliance with Equation 1. For greater clarity, we have revised the sentence in the abstract as follows:\n\n> Moreover, our theoretical analysis substantiates that the proposed function is in fact submodular.\n\n and we also have revised the sentence in the introduction as follows:\n\n> Furthermore, our analysis at the theoretical level confirms that the proposed function is indeed submodular.\n\n----\n\n**Q4:** Is there an explanation on why the blue curve on the left of Figure 1 dips to almost 0 around 0.8?\n\n**AQ4:** Thanks for your question. The blue curve denotes the prediction score for the specific category, which is computed based on the discovered subset regions. Since the visual similarity between different bird categories is high, some categories are easily confused based on the partial features. In Fig.1,  with the growth of the discovered regions, we may introduce some features for the other category, and thus the prediction score drops for the zeros. We also provide more visualization results in the Appendix. \n\n----\n\n**Q5:** You claim your method can find fewer regions that make the model predictions more confident but I am seeing more highlighted regions in your setting. Am I missing something or misreading the images? Can you elaborate more on what I should be seeing?\n\n**AQ5:** Thanks for your kind reminder. The advantage of our proposed attribution method is to discover the discriminative regions for the prediction. If we discovered the correct subregions, the prediction confidence would be higher than using the entire image, especially for fine-grained object recognition. \n\nFor example, as illustrated in Figure 1, when the entire image is fed into the recognition model, the confidence level for the correctly predicted category is approximately 0.7. However, when utilizing only 25% of the image area, as identified by our method, the model\'s confidence level for the correct category exceeds 0.7. This indicates that our method enables the model to make predictions with higher confidence using fewer regions. \n\n----\n\n**Q6:** How does your method compare to the SOTA HSIC-Attribution method in terms of algorithmic complexity and time?\n\n**AQ6:** Our method requires the initial computation of a saliency map to facilitate the division of sub-regions. When employing HSIC-Attribution as the baseline, this implies that both the time and space complexity of our approach depend on those of HSIC-Attribution, while also taking into account the time and space complexity associated with the greedy search component. Consequently, achieving superior attribution results with our method may require a higher time complexity compared to HSIC-Attribution.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Official Response to Reviewer 2zii (1/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thanks for your encouraging evaluations and constructive comments.

Can the author add an ablation experiment to observe the impact of different partition sizes on the results without adding a priori saliency map, such as 8x8, 12x12, etc.\n\n**AW3:** Thanks for your helpful suggestion. We have added relevant experiments, specifically exploring the impact of six different division sizes on the results. As depicted in the table below, our results indicate that dividing the image into more patches yields higher average highest confidence scores (0-100%). However, excessive division can introduce instability in the early search area (0-25%). In summary, without incorporating a priori saliency maps for division, opting for a 10x10 patch division followed by subset selection appears to be the optimal choice.\n\nDue to the length of the paper, we have added these quantitative experiments in the appendix.

We have added three different backbone architectures in this experiment to validate the generalization of our method. Besides the VGGNet, we also use two alternative and more advanced backbones: MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetV2-M.\n\nWe conducted the experiment under the same setting as those employed for ResNet-101. When employing VGGNet-19, our method outperforms the SOTA method HSIC-Attribution, achieving a 70.2% increase in the average highest confidence and a 5.2% improvement in the Insertion AUC score. While utilizing MobileNetV2, our method outperforms the SOTA method HSIC-Attribution, achieving an 84.2% increase in the average highest confidence and a 17.6% improvement in the Insertion AUC score. Similarly, with EfficientNetV2-M,  our method surpasses HSIC-Attribution, achieving a 23.4% increase in the average highest confidence and an 8.5% improvement in the Insertion AUC score. This indicates the versatility and effectiveness of our method across various backbones. Note that the 400 incorrectly predicted samples used by VGGNet-19, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetV2-M in the experiment are not exactly the same, given the differences across the networks.\n\nDue to the length of the paper, we have added these quantitative experiments in the appendix.

We have added a section discussing the limitations of this method in the Appendix.\n\nThe main limitation of our method is the computation time depending on the sub-region division approach. Specifically, we first divide the image into different subregions, and then we use the greed algorithm to search for the important subset regions. To accelerate the search process, we introduce the prior maps, which are computed based on the existing attribution methods. However, we observe that the performance of our attribution method is based on the scale of subregions, where the smaller regions would achieve much better accuracy as shown in the experiments. There exists a trade-off between the accuracy and the computation time. In the future, we will explore a better optimization strategy to solve this limitation.\n\nWe performed experiments on the attribution of incorrectly predicted samples and examined the effects of varying set sizes on the experimental results, using the network ResNet-101. As shown in the table below, a larger set size $m$ results in an increase in the average highest confidence within the search region. However, it's important to note that this improvement also leads to a rise in the computational time cost.\n\n|       Method       | Set size $m$ | Avg. highest conf.

Without considering the calculation of the prior saliency map, our proposed attribution method belongs to the black-box-based explanation method. The black-box interpretation is defined as that these models make predictions based on input data, but the decision-making process and reasoning behind the predictions are not transparent to the user. In this paper, our method is only using the output of the specific model without requiring the other information. Thus, our proposed attribution method is the black-box-based approach.""}}, {'summary': {'value': ""The paper points out two main issues with current State-of-the-Art (SoTA) image attribution methods: they ignore the impact of local, fine-grained attribution regions which may lead to incorrect explanations, and they may struggle to map the region/cause of a prediction error to image samples. \n\nTo address these problems, the authors propose a new method based on submodular functions that divides an image into smaller regions and then selects the most informative ones (subset selection) to explain the model's decision-making process. They also employ a regional search to expand on the search regions.\nThe paper also introduces a novel submodular function to provide clearer and more detailed explanations, especially for incorrect predictions based on four major clues - confidence, effectiveness, consistency and collaboration scores.\n\nThe effectiveness of this new method is supported by experiments on facial recognition and fine-grained image recognition datasets, where it is shown to perform better than the current SoTA methods.""}, 'soundness': {'value': '3 good'}, 'presentation': {'value': '2 fair'}, 'contribution': {'value': '3 good'}, 'strengths': {'value': '1.

The use of saliency maps $A$ in sub-region division is unclear. The paper should highlight how saliency maps are used to evaluate patch importance.\n3. Most of the scoring functions like  $s_{eff.}$, $s_{cons.}$ etc.  rely on cosine similarity or distance metrics which have been studied extensively in literature (Deng et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2018 etc.) but have not been cited in the paper.\n4. The paper lacks the explanation regarding how individual scores contribute to achieving their respective objectives. For example, $s_{colla.}$ employs a cosine distance metric between the semantic feature vector of the target class $f_s$ and features extracted from the residual regions of the original image when the selected subset of regions $S$ is removed. To the best of my knowledge, maximizing this metric ensures that the collective impact of the selected region is sufficient to generate explainable representations.\n5. The proposed greedy search algorithm (section 4.3) has been studied for subset selection tasks (Wei et al., 2015) and is therefore prior art.\n6.

Although existing attribution solutions can effectively assign importance to target elements, they still face the following challenges: 1) existing attribution methods generate inaccurate small regions thus misleading the direction of correct attribution, and 2) the model cannot produce good attribution results for samples with wrong predictions. To address the above challenges, this paper re-models the above image attribution problem as a submodular subset selection problem, aiming to enhance model interpretability using fewer regions. To address the lack of attention to local regions, we construct a novel submodular function to discover more accurate small interpretation regions. To enhance the attribution effect for all samples, we also impose four different constraints on the selection of sub-regions, i.e., confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores, to assess the importance of various subsets. Moreover, our theoretical analysis substantiates that the proposed function is in fact submodular.

This limits their ability to effectively solve tasks involving extended time gaps between actions and outcomes, or tasks demanding the recalling of distant observations to inform current actions. To improve temporal coherence, we integrate a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I). This integration aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment. Through a diverse set of illustrative tasks, we systematically demonstrate that R2I not only establishes a new state-of-the-art for challenging memory and credit assignment RL tasks, such as BSuite and POPGym, but also showcases superhuman performance in the complex memory domain of Memory Maze. At the same time, it upholds comparable performance in classic RL tasks, such as Atari and DMC, suggesting the generality of our method. We also show that R2I is faster than the state-of-the-art MBRL method, DreamerV3, resulting in faster wall-time convergence.",Oral 8C,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=1vDArHJ68h,https://openreview.net/forum?id=1vDArHJ68h,1vDArHJ68h,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'This paper contributes a new RL algorithm which achieves state of the art performance on some standard benchmarks.

We have taken your remarks into serious consideration and would like to clarify the performance narrative based on comprehensive evaluations across various environments. Specifically, DreamerV3 and R2I are on par in 41 environments **(1)**. Our definition of ""on par"" is that the median (for a fixed game) performance of one method is within the confidence interval of the other algorithm, and **vice versa**. At the same time, there are 15 environments where R2I and DreamerV3 are insignificantly different **(2)**. Our definition of ""insignificantly different"" is that only one algorithm\'s median lies within the confidence interval of the other, while the other\'s median performance may lie outside of the first one algorithm - upper or lower. This is so because there are multiple different cases for the relation of scores between R2I and DreamerV3. Finally, if the median performance of R2I lies outside of DreamerV3\'s confidence, and DreamerV3\'s median performance lies outside of R2I\'s confidence, we say that they are significantly different. For R2I and DreamerV3, there are only 8 such environments **(3)**, and in one of them (Bank Heist of Atari 100K), R2I is significantly better than DreamerV3.\n\nIn summary, there are 41 + 15 + 1 = 57 environments where R2I is not significantly worse than DreamerV3, and in the majority of these environments (41 out of 57), they perform on par. Out of all environments, the remaining 7 are the ones where DreamerV3 is significantly better than R2I, which is only approximately **10%** of all standard RL tasks considered (7/64).\n\nIn light of these observations, we believe the generality claim in the paper is still correct. We propose to add the following to the text: âWhile R2I outperforms DreamerV3 in certain environments and vice versa, the overall performance analysis suggests that they offer similar behavior across a wide array of standard RL benchmarks, differing in only a small subset of these.â\n\nWould this articulation align with your insights, or would you advise further refinement? We appreciate any further guidance you may offer to help us align our revisions with your suggestions.\n\n---\n**P.S.** We believe the issue of convincing the community that a certain method is not different from some other method comes from the lack of statistical methodology for RL. There exists only one notable work [1] which mainly focuses on determining if the methods are different but not if the methods perform comparably (these two questions assume different null hypotheses, and statistically answering one does not statistically answer the other). We are aware that certain statistical tests exist that answer questions similar to ours; however, we believe that a certain adaptation of these methods should be done to apply them to report results in RL.\n\n\n**(1)** Environments are DMC-proprio: Finger Spin, Pendulum Swingup, Walker Stand, Finger Turn Hard, Walker Run, Cartpole Balance, Cup Catch, Walker Walk, Hopper Stand, Reacher Hard, Hopper Hop, Finger Turn Easy, Cheetah Run, Cartpole Balance; DMC-vision: Walker Stand, Quadruped Run, Cup Catch, Cartpole Swingup Sparse, Quadruped Walk, Cartpole Balance Sparse, Cartpole Balance, Hopper Hop, Walker Walk, Finger Turn Easy, Reacher Easy; Atari100k: Alien, Asterix, Battle Zone, Boxing, Crazy Climber, Demon Attack, Freeway, Gopher, Hero, James Bond, Kung Fu Master, Ms Pacman, Qbert, Seaquest, UpNDown.\n\n**(2)** Environments are DMC-proprio: Cartpole Swingup, Cartpole Swingup Sparse; DMC-vision: Finger Turn Hard, Cheetah Run, Finger Spin, Finger Turn Easy, Pendulum Swingup; Atari100k: Amidar, Assault, Breakout, Chopper Command, Frostbite, Kangaroo, Private Eye, Road Runner.\n\n**(3)** Environments are DMC-proprio: Acrobot Swingup; DMC-vision: Walker Run, Acrobot Swingup, Cartpole Swingup, Reacher Hard;  Atari100k: Bank Heist, Krull, Pong.\n\n\n---\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Agarwal et al.

Recognizing the necessity to highlight the distinctiveness of R2I amidst S4WM, we acknowledge the value of such an evaluation. To address this concern, we wish to provide an analytical comparison between R2I and S4WM, demonstrating that these are significantly different algorithms. We believe S4WM makes a valuable contribution to world modeling, which is a subtask of MBRL. **Improved world modeling quality is neither necessarily nor sufficiently linked to an improved expected reward in MBRL**. To support this claim, we have added a new section (please refer to the newly added **Section Q of the Appendix**) to the Appendix, with the following discussion: First, we present both theoretical and experimental evidence from existing literature that suggests the likelihood of the world model does not directly translate to reward [1, 2, 3], and sometimes a negative correlation is observed. Second, we conduct an experiment in Memory Maze environments, which is a task of primary interest in both S4WM and R2I, where we demonstrate cases of negative correlation between the return and image MSE (i.e., the expected return improves while image MSE worsens). We also interpret how this result relates to S4WM's experimental outcomes. Third, we provide a detailed table comparing all architectural choices made by R2I and S4WM, noting there are 9 non-trivial architectural differences, excluding network sizes and depths (although these also vary). For each difference, we interpret our understanding of its impact on policy learning. Please note that our comparison is with the S4WM version that was publicly available on Arxiv on July 5th, 2023, not the Arxiv version from November 9, 2023, and not the camera-ready version from NeurIPS 2023 (whose deadline was October 27, 2023)âone month after the ICLR paper deadline. Finally, S4WM reports metrics on offline RL datasets collected by agents assumed to be nearly optimal. However, in MBRL, the world model and policy commence training with data produced by a random agent. In summary, we believe R2I and S4WM are distinct models designed to solve different (but related) tasks, released concurrently online, with no evidence that S4WM will function out-of-the-box for reinforcement learning problemsâon the contrary, there is evidence suggesting that significant modifications are necessary for S4WM to operate as an MBRL algorithm.\n\n---\n> I noticed there are no mentions about making the code available. Thus, it would be specially benefitting for reproducibility if authors include a summary of the alg in pseudocode at the appendix.\n\nThank you for pointing out the need for enhanced reproducibility. We currently have a solid codebase, and we plan to open-source a well-documented repo along with the paper to facilitate replication of R2I. Our implementation leverages the **Jax** framework, chosen for its simplicity and efficiency. While Jax was our framework of choice, we acknowledge that the core component of our algorithmâthe SSM inference with parallel scan â could potentially be implemented in pure PyTorch as well with the same efficiency as in Jax, without the need to use custom CUDA kernels, which is the case for convolution mode. Bearing this in mind and with an aim to enhance reproducibility, in the revised version, we included a detailed pseudocode for our algorithm (please refer to **Appendix S**).\n\n---\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Joseph et al.

Consequently, the distribution of final success rates for DreamerV3 exhibits bimodality in these instances, with certain final success rates achieving 1, while others remain at 0. R2I inherits this property of DreamerV3 but, due to its extended memory capabilitiesâwhich result in a higher number of successful casesâexperiences greater fluctuations in the median success rate. This is the reason we opted for 10 seeds per episode length.\n\nTo potentially resolve the issues, we can increase the number of seeds (which currently stands at 10). Stabilizing can be a good potential future direction to explore in R2I and Dreamer. Note that such instability has not been observed in any other environment tested in this study, with either DreamerV3 or R2I.\n\n---\n**To wrap up, we appreciate your insightful observations and have diligently applied them to better our work.

We appreciate your recognition of our approach to handling long-term dependencies in world models using SSMs and are pleased to note the acknowledgment of our extensive ablation studies. The new state-of-the-art performance and improved computational efficiency are key contributions of our work, which we are glad to have been highlighted. We believe these establish the significance and practical value of our research. \n\nWe have carefully considered the concerns raised and would like to address them as follows:\n\n---\n> Despite the conducted ablation in Appendix O, the question on why the different input variations work differently across environments still remains open.\n\nWe acknowledge the reviewer's point on different policy inputs. To address this, we believe the policy input type should be chosen based on the type of partial observability exposed by the environment.\n\nAs a reminder, the SSM network has a hidden vector \\$x_t\\$ (passing between steps of SSM) and output vector \\$h_t\\$ (passed to the observation and reward heads). For instance, consider the \\$\\texttt{Memory Length}\\$ task in the BSuite. The agent observes the query vector in the first step and is then tasked to output an action corresponding to that query in the last step of the episode. The reward is only given in the last step of the episode and only in the case when the action aligns with the initial query. We therefore hypothesize that this provides an incentive for \\$h_T\\$ to represent everything necessary for the policy, which is why the output state policy works best there. In contrast, BSuiteâs \\$\\texttt{Discounting Chain}\\$ is a credit assignment problem where the rewards are delayed. Thus, we hypothesize that there is no such incentive for \\$h_t\\$ to represent everything needed by the policy, hence the hidden state policy works better.\n\n---\n> It does not motivate the employment of Dreamer (or, more generally, Model-Based RL).\n\n> In the same line, Figure 4 brings some âmemory-augmentedâ Model-Free baselines, but it lacks âPPO + SSMsâ. This baseline would definitely clarify my concern.\n\nThank you for pointing out the need for a more explicit rationale regarding our choice of MBRL and Dreamer. In response to your request, we wish to explain our motivation for concentrating on MBRL over MFRL. Our focus on MBRL stems from its potential in sample efficiency, reusability, transferability, and safer planning, along with the advantage of more controllable aspects due to its explicit supervised learning component (i.e., world modeling). \n\nIn line with your feedback, we have integrated the â\\$\\texttt{PPO + SSMs}\\$â baseline into our evaluations in POPGym (please refer to **Section 4.1** and **Figure 4**). All empirical results from our experiments on POPGym and Memory Maze speak to the aforementioned advantages of MBRL, suggesting the superiority of MBRL in these domains. Within the realm of MBRL methodologies, we decided to build upon the SOTA DreamerV3 framework, which has proven capacities for generalization, sample efficiency, and scalability. \n\nWe acknowledge the need for an explicit comparison and motivation and have accordingly addressed this in the revised version of our paper in **Appendix B**, highlighting the rationale for choosing MBRL.\n\n---\n> In Section 4.3, the claim of ânot sacrificing generalityâ is questionable. There is a small drop in performance.\n\nWe appreciate your attention to the details presented in the appendix. We understand your concerns with the phrase ânot sacrificing generalityâ and agree that our claim may benefit from moderation to more accurately reflect the experimental results. In the revision, we have adjusted our language to better communicate the nuanced performance outcomes (please refer to **Section 4.3**). Please also refer to the newly added Appendix **section R** where we provide a more deep statistical analysis of the results on Standard RL tasks.\n\nWhile it's true that there are some tasks where DreamerV3 shows slightly better performance, our aggregated metrics suggest that the performance of DreamerV3 is preserved in the majority of environments. We employed the RLiable [1] package in the revision to show that the difference between them is negligible. It is worth noting that there are 64 such environments with diverse properties such as the type of control, reward sparsity, dynamics stochasticity, and more which is why preserving them all is extremely non-trivial.\n\n---\n> In Appendix H, task Autoencode: the episode length for the Hard task is 156. Is that right? I believe it is supposed to be 256.\n\nThank you for your careful reading of Appendix H. We have double-checked our experimental settings and can verify that the episode length specified for Autoencode-Hard is correct at 156. This is because the lengths in the Autoencode environments are multiple of 52 (the number of cards in a standard deck).""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author Response (Cont.)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""> Three kinds of actor and critic inputs are introduced, namely, output state, hidden state and full state, which results in a critical design choice to be tuned for each domain. Although the authors provide some takeaways to select between them, it is not always true.\n\nThank you for your feedback. We respectfully have a different view that we would like to clarify. To this end, we believe the policy input type should be chosen based on the type of partial observability exposed by the environment.\n\nAs a reminder, the SSM network has a hidden vector \\$x_t\\$ (passing between steps of SSM) and output vector \\$h_t\\$ (passed to the observation and reward heads).

An empirical testimony for this fact (PO property of DMC-vision) can be found in the original DeepMind Control paper (see **Figure 6**). The same RL algorithm with an MLP or CNN backbone is applied to DMC environments with vector (full) and image (partial) observations. There exists a constant gap between these two variants, and the performance is lower for the image observation model. In the case of R2I, the best policy in DMC-proprio is the output state, since it is a fully observable environment and \\$h_t\\$ is tasked to predict this full observation. However, since DMC-vision is a PO domain, we found the hidden state policy to work better there.\n\n---\n> The authors say R2I's 'objective differs from ELBO in three ways', but to my knowledge, these three points are all borrowed from DreamerV3 but without explicitly being mentioned in the text.\n\nWe'd like to clarify that the integration of SSMs with DreamerV3's world model was explicitly stated at the beginning of **Section 3**. However, it is true that we did not explicitly mention that our objective is the same as in DreamerV3. Despite this, each time we mentioned any changes in the objective function in relation to ELBO, we properly cited DreamerV3 and other related works which initially proposed those changes. In order to avoid any future confusion, we have updated our paper to explicitly state that our objective is borrowed from the DreamerV3 algorithm.\n\n---\n**Questions**\n\n---\n> Dreamer is compared in Memory Maze tasks. Does this Dreamer baseline include the TBTT technique proposed by Pasukonis et al., which improves the memory of RSSM?\n\nYes, to facilitate a more fair comparison, we included the TBTT version of the Dreamer in the initial submission. To avoid any future confusion, we have marked the Dreamer algorithm as **Dreamer (TBTT)**.\n\n---\n> Why not include Transformer-based world models as baselines? \n\nThank you for the suggestion to include Transformer-based world models as baselines. We did assess off-the-shelf Transformer models but found they performed poorly on desired tasks, without extensive hyperparameter tuning (which falls a bit outside the scope of this work). On another note, we also threw these models onto the evaluation for a speed test, which as expected, they were slower.\n\n---\n**In conclusion, your constructive criticisms have been valuable in enhancing the quality and clarity of our research. We hope the revisions and clarifications provided have resolved your concerns.

We are encouraged by your recognition of the strengths in our work, including the improved performance of model-based RL with SSMs world models in memory-intensive settings, the careful design for non-recurrent representation and computational modeling, the breadth of our experimental validation across various domains, and the clarity and detail provided in our writing. We appreciate your comments and are eager to address your concerns and questions that you indicated.\n\n---\n\n> Limited contribution. It is notable that there already exists a S4-based world model, namely S4WM.\n\nIndeed, another recent work that constructs an SSM-based world model, namely S4WM, appeared on Arxiv on **July 5th, 2023**, which is **2.5 months** before the ICLR paper deadline. However, we would like to highlight the fact that according to the ICLR public review guidelines, **all papers made available online within 4 months of the paper deadline are considered contemporaneous** (and authors are not required to compare with those papers). Despite this, we wish to provide an analytical comparison between R2I and S4WM, demonstrating that these are significantly different algorithms. We believe S4WM makes a valuable contribution to world modeling, which is a subtask of MBRL. **Improved world modeling quality is neither necessarily nor sufficiently linked to an improved expected reward in MBRL**. To support this claim, we have added a new section (please refer to the newly added **Section Q of the Appendix**) to the Appendix, with the following discussion: First, we present both theoretical and experimental evidence from existing literature that suggests the likelihood of the world model does not directly translate to reward [1, 2, 3], and sometimes a negative correlation is observed. Second, we conduct an experiment in Memory Maze environments, which is a task of primary interest in both S4WM and R2I, where we demonstrate cases of negative correlation between the return and image MSE (i.e., the expected return improves while image MSE worsens). We also interpret how this result relates to S4WM's experimental outcomes. Third, we provide a detailed table comparing all architectural choices made by R2I and S4WM, noting there are 9 non-trivial architectural differences, excluding network sizes and depths (although these also vary). For each difference, we interpret our understanding of its impact on policy learning. Please note that our comparison is with the S4WM version that was publicly available on Arxiv on July 5th, 2023, not the Arxiv version from November 9, 2023, and not the camera-ready version from NeurIPS 2023 (whose deadline was October 27, 2023)âone month after the ICLR paper deadline. Finally, S4WM reports metrics on offline RL datasets collected by agents assumed to be nearly optimal. However, in MBRL, the world model and policy commence training with data produced by a random agent. In summary, we believe R2I and S4WM are distinct models designed to solve different (but related) tasks, released concurrently online, with no evidence that S4WM will function out-of-the-box for reinforcement learning problemsâon the contrary, there is evidence suggesting that significant modifications are necessary for S4WM to operate as an MBRL algorithm.\n\n---\n\n> The authors claim that R2I does not sacrifice generality for improved memory capabilities. However, there is a clear trend in Figure 6, that R2I performs worse than Dreamer in standard RL tasks.\n\nWe appreciate your attention to the details presented in the paper. We understand your concerns with the phrase ânot sacrificing generalityâ and agree that our claim may benefit from moderation to more accurately reflect the experimental results. In the revision, we have adjusted our language to better communicate the nuanced performance outcomes (please refer to **Section 4.3**). Please also refer to the newly added **Appendix R** where we provide a more deep statistical analysis of the results on Standard RL tasks.\n\nWhile it's true that there are some tasks where DreamerV3 shows slightly better performance, our aggregated metrics suggest that the performance of DreamerV3 is preserved in the majority of environments. We employed the RLiable [4] package in the revision to show that the difference between them is negligible. It is worth noting that there are 64 such environments with diverse properties such as the type of control, reward sparsity, dynamics stochasticity, and more which is why preserving them all is extremely non-trivial.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Joseph et al.

An examination of insights from existing literature, which indicates that enhanced world modeling (a primary task of interest in S4WM) does not necessarily translate to improved model-based RL performance.\n2. The design and results of a synthetic experiment where the main metric of interest of S4WM (image mean-squared-error) worsens, while the primary metric for RL methods and R2I (expected return) shows improvement.\n3. An explicit distinction between R2I and S4WM by presenting a list of 9 significant algorithmic distinctions between the two and explaining how each of them can facilitate improved reinforcement learning.\n\nThe latest revision of our paper has been uploaded, addressing all comments and queries raised by the reviewers. Additionally, we have added a sole experimental update in which we further trained R2I over an extended memory length in the Memory Maze.

And the raised hypothesis on âfeature instabilityâ sounds vague and not properly backed up by a solid argument. It would be great to provide a better understanding of this challenge to give more clarity on how the method works, but I understand this is a difficult open problem that demands a careful investigation.\n\n- The work adopts SSMs to address the challenge of handling long-term dependencies in RL (memory and credit assignment). Nevertheless, it does not motivate the employment of Dreamer (or, more generally, Model-Based RL). I think it is important to describe and motivate why Dreamer was used instead of Model-Free RL, as it is not clear why MBRL would be better than MFRL for these memory tasks (unless there is another motivation besides asymptotic performance, such as sample efficiency).\n\n    - In the same line, Figure 4 brings some âmemory-augmentedâ Model-Free baselines, but it lacks âPPO + SSMsâ. This baseline would definitely clarify my concern. If there is no constraint in the sample budget, it is possible (perhaps expected) that the MFRL agent would perform better.\n\n- In Section 4.3, the claim of ânot sacrificing generalityâ is questionable. There is a small drop in performance. For instance, in Appendix J (DMC-proprio), DreamerV3 is (at least) slightly better in 6 tasks.  In Appendix K (DMC-Vision), 8 environments. In Appendix L (Atari), 10 environments. I suggest rephrasing the claim to account what is observed in the Appendices.\n\n- The work from Deng et.al [1], proposing S4WM, looks very similar to the proposed one. Indeed, both works propose replacing the RSSM with SSMs with the same motivation: improving memory capabilities. The work on S4WM was publicly released approximately 2.5 months before this submission, which can be seen as concurrent work. Nevertheless, I believe the work is almost overlooked by the proposed paper, which has a small citation in Section 5. Given the similarity, it would be crucial to provide a more detailed comparison contrasting both works, in terms of methodology and evaluation, perhaps in the Introduction or in a separate Appendix.\n\n**Minor Concerns**\n\n- In Appendix H, task Autoencode: the episode length for the Hard task is 156.

NeurIPS, 2023.\n\n**Summary of the Review**\n\nThe work brings an effective improvement on World Models due to a well-motivated employment of State Space Models. This validates this architecture and extends its effectiveness in dealing with sequences in RL. The work does a great job in empirical analysis, anticipating many questions and answering them with extensive experiments and ablations. On the other hand, I believe the paper could be improved if the aforementioned concerns were addressed. Nevertheless, these concerns are not critical enough to prevent acceptance.'}, 'questions': {'value': '- In Appendix G (BSuite environment), is there any hypothesis on why sometimes harder environments (longer memory steps) present better performance than easier ones? For instance, R2Iâs performance on 31 memory steps is better than 15 memory steps. Similarly, the performance in 81 memory steps seems better (or more stable) than 41 memory steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===================== **POST-REBUTTAL** ==================================\n\nDear authors,\n\nThanks for putting so much effort on addressing my concerns. I believe they led to substantial improvements in an already good work, so I am raising my scores towards acceptance.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- I appreciate the efforts on formulating hypotheses on why the different input variations work differently across environments. I believe the raised hypotheses are valid and potential venues for future work. As I mentioned before, this seems to be a difficult problem that requires careful investigation. It would be interesting to bring this rebuttal discussion into the paper, as I believe this could also be an important question for other readers. This is also valid to the point related to Appendix G.\n\n- I also would like to thank you for adding the new PPO + SSMs baseline. Turns out to be very different from what I expected, and given the discussion on Appendix T, I think it should require careful tuning to work with PPO (which is, indeed, a very sensible algorithm). But this is an argument in favor of the proposed method and perhaps another open question to be addressed (i.e., how to make SSM to work with PPO)\n\n- Thanks for addressing the tone of the claim in Section 4.3 and providing more evidence regarding it. I agree that given the diversity of environments, it is hard to ensure that all of them will attain the same performance, and the new wording also better reflects the presented results.\n\n- Lastly, the Appendix Q is great.

The max amount of data we experimented in this paper is 45k examples, which has already demonstrated better data efficiency than other methods (manually annotation, distillation) at that scale. It is definitely an exciting direction to further scale up the augmented data by orders of magnitude or even apply it to pretraining data.\n\n> 2).

In Table7, what if the results of Humpback 65B with 5-shot demonstrations?\n\nThat is an interesting question. The rationale of the comparisons in Table 7 is that few-shot in-context learning is an alternative approach to enable LLM instruction-following capabilities besides finetuning. Therefore, it is more fair to compare the zero-shot performance of finetuned model with few-shot in-context learning from the based model.'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""> What is the impact of self-curation iterations?

Classic asscher cut diamonds are cut into squares and resemble emerald cuts, which are rectangular. Asscher cut diamonds are different to a square emerald cut in that they have larger step facets, a higher crown, smaller table and have more brilliance. The corners are cropped to give the shape an octagonal appearance.\n\n### Baguette Cut\n\nAlthough the baguette cut was invented sometime prior to the mid-1500s, it only gained popularity in 1912 when Cartier reintroduced the cut to the modern world. Its elongated, table cut, rectangular shape became highly fashionable in the geometric craze of the Art Deco period.\n\n### Emerald Cut\n\nThe emerald diamond cut emerged as one of the first faceted diamond cuts, third in line after the point cut and the table cut. The cut has a dramatic hall of mirrors effect and was standardised in the 1940s.  \n\\newline\n```\n*Generated instruction:*\n    List the most popular diamond cuts in the Art Deco era.\n```\nInclusive Sports Coaching provides 1:1 Programs for individuals looking to develop their sporting skills, as well as improve their self confidence and opportunities for social and community inclusion.\n\nWe recommend an 8 or 12 Session program to identify areas for improvement and sporting skills, conduct drills and physical activities to work towards specific outcomes, while engaging with the client in areas such as listening, memory retention, cognitive processing, social interaction, encouraging conversations, accepting and giving constructive feedback, and other areas as needed.\n\nAt the halfway point we produce a status report on progress, and have found parents/carers often share this with OT's, Physios and Teachers as a way to share information on the individual and provide a strong network of support.

"['Jie Hu', 'Vishwaraj Doshi', 'Do Young Eun']",ICLR,Accelerating Distributed Stochastic Optimization via Self-Repellent Random Walks,https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19780,2024," We study a family of distributed stochastic optimization algorithms where gradients are sampled by a token traversing a network of agents in random-walk fashion. Typically, these random-walks are chosen to be Markov chains that asymptotically sample from a desired target distribution, and play a critical role in the convergence of the optimization iterates. In this paper, we take a novel approach by replacing the standard *linear* Markovian token by one which follows a *non-linear* Markov chain - namely the Self-Repellent Radom Walk (SRRW). Defined for any given 'base' Markov chain, the SRRW, parameterized by a positive scalar $\\alpha$, is less likely to transition to states that were highly visited in the past, thus the name. In the context of MCMC sampling on a graph, a recent breakthrough in Doshi et al. (2023) shows that the SRRW achieves $O(1/\\alpha)$ decrease in the asymptotic variance for sampling. We propose the use of a `generalized' version of the SRRW to drive token algorithms for distributed stochastic optimization in the form of stochastic approximation, termed SA-SRRW. We prove that the optimization iterate errors of the resulting SA-SRRW converge to zero almost surely and prove a central limit theorem, deriving the explicit form of the resulting asymptotic covariance matrix corresponding to iterate errors. This asymptotic covariance is always smaller than that of an algorithm driven by the base Markov chain and decreases at rate $O(1/\\alpha^2)$ - the performance benefit of using SRRW thereby *amplified* in the stochastic optimization context.

From the simulation, it seems the larger $\\\\alpha$, the faster convergence. Is there any suggestion for a practical choice of $\\\\alpha$?\n\nAnswer: In practice, we recommend using moderate values of $\\\\alpha$, e.g., $\\\\alpha=5$. Since covariance in case (i) decreases at a rate of $O(1/\\\\alpha^2)$, even moderate values of $\\\\alpha$ are sufficient to achieve small errors, e.g., $\\\\alpha=5$ in Figure 2(c). Moreover, itâs important to consider the potential drawbacks of setting $\\\\alpha$ too large. As illustrated in Figure 2(b), larger $\\\\alpha$ values could slow down convergence in the early stage of the training process. For example, when $\\\\alpha$ is set to $10$ or $20$, performance is slightly inferior to $\\\\alpha=5$ until $n\\\\approx 5Ã10^4$.\n\n>### (Q5). If the $\\\\alpha$ is also updated, for example, we use $\\\\alpha_n$ at the iterate $n$ that increases at a carefully selected rate in advance (or perhaps could be updated using a third iterate). Can we accelerate the convergence rate of $\\\\theta_n$ so that its mean square error is faster than $\\\\beta_n$?\n\nAnswer: Assume $\\\\alpha\\_n$ is updated through a third iterate and converges to some finite value $\\\\alpha^*$, we speculate that the asymptotic rate of MSE cannot go faster than $\\\\beta\\_n$. Our current analysis, as detailed in Theorem 3.3, addresses scenarios with a fixed $\\\\alpha$ value. Here, the influence of the SRRW sequence $\\\\{X\\_n\\\\}$ is encapsulated within the matrix $\\\\mathbf{U}$, which contributes to the asymptotic covariance $\\\\mathbf{V}\\_{\\\\theta}$ of $\\\\theta\\_n$. Introducing a time-varying $\\\\alpha\\_n$ adds a new dimension to the system, potentially transforming the SA-SRRW algorithm, which we analyze via *two-timescale* SA setting, into a *three-timescale* SA. The CLT analysis of such a complex scenario remains unexplored and presents an interesting avenue for future research. Intuitively speaking, in the asymptotic regime, as $\\\\alpha\\_n$ already approaches $\\\\alpha^*$, the behavior of sequence $\\\\{X\\_n\\\\}$ would likely be similar to that driven by SRRW with constant $\\\\alpha^*$. This means that while varying $\\\\alpha_n$ impacts the asymptotic covariance $\\\\mathbf{V}\\_{\\\\theta}$ through matrix $\\\\mathbf{U}$, the convergence rate of $\\\\theta\\_n$, determined by $\\\\beta\\_n^{-1/2}$, would remain unchanged. Hence, even with a dynamic $\\\\alpha\\_n$, the MSE of $\\\\theta\\_n-\\\\theta^*$ is still expected to converge at a rate tied to $\\\\beta_n$, according to our current theoretical framework.\n\n>### (Q6): Are there any other examples where $X$ takes finite value? In my opinion, for a general SA method, the randomness or the noise could be various. Note that the Poisson method used in the proof is not limited to discrete randomness. Is it possible to extend the analysis to a more general setting where $X$ could be a continuous random variable? If not, where is the main difficulty?\n\nAnswer: Our SA-SRRW algorithm is versatile and not limited to decentralized optimization employed with token algorithm only. It is equally applicable to scenarios in stochastic optimization where the entire dataset is fully accessible. This application is particularly prevalent in the machine learning domain, such as in training neural networks using SGD or other accelerated algorithms. In these instances, the dataset forms a *complete graph with self-loops* so that $X$ can be independently and identically sampled from the dataset with marginal distribution $\\\\mu$, implying that these instances can also be transformed into the decentralized optimization in the broader sense. Here, the baseline Markov chain $\\\\mathbf{P}$, as indicated in the SRRW kernel (3), becomes a rank-1 matrix $\\\\mathbf{1}\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}^T$. \n\nMeanwhile, $X$ cannot be a continuous random variable. The limitation here is not related to the Poisson method used in our proofs but is inherent to the structure of the SRRW employed in the SA method. Specifically, the concept of self-repellence in SRRW requires counting the visits to each state $X$ to form the empirical measure $\\\\mathbf{x}\\_n$ at time $n$. This count is crucial for designing the SRRW kernel $\\\\mathbf{K}[\\\\mathbf{x}\\_n]$. In a continuous state space, such a counting mechanism becomes infeasible since the chance of sampling the same $X$ in the continuous state space is measure zero, posing a significant challenge to the design and implementation of a continuous version of SRRW in our algorithm.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer DxLx (1/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""We appreciate the reviewer for the detailed comments. Please find our replies to your questions below.\n\n>### (Q1). Under the paragraph below (3), the author tries to explain why SRRW gets its name. More specifically, they said ''if node $j$ has been visited more often so far, the entry $x_j$ becomes larger (than target value $\\\\mu_j$ )''. I didnât understand the logic behind it. If node $j$ has been visited more often, I think $x_j$, as the coordinate of a distribution vector, should be close to $\\\\mu_j$. I canât tell whether $x_j$ is larger than $\\\\mu_j$ or not. However, I acknowledge that the nonlinear kernel in (3) would encourage the algorithm to visit the states that are less visited, based on its expression.\n\nAnswer: Your interpretation ''$x_j$ should be close to $\\\\mu_j$â is indeed accurate in the context of long-term behavior, where the empirical distribution $\\\\mathbf{x}$ converges towards the target distribution $\\\\mu$ almost surely. However, the point of confusion seems to arise from our description 'if node $j$ has been visited more often so far'. To clarify, when saying 'node $j$ has been visited more often', we mean that the node $j$ has been visited more often than other nodes (and we have improved this explanation in the revision). In this context, according to the definition of empirical distribution, the entry $[\\\\mathbf{x}\\_n]\\_j$ â representing the proportion of visits to node $j$ at time $n$ â can be (temporarily) larger than its target value $\\\\mu_j$. In this case, node $j$ will be chosen with smaller probability at time $n+1$ by the SRRW kernel with $\\\\mathbf{x}\\_n$ in place of $\\\\mathbf{x}$ in (3). Note that, eventually, from the SRRW convergence result, all these $[\\\\mathbf{x}\\_n]\\_j$ will converge to the target $\\\\mu\\_j$ as n increases, as you pointed out already. In some sense, SRRW tries to exploit such temporal fluctuation (while keeping the stationary behavior the same) to 'force' the random walker to reduce such temporal fluctuation (deviation of $\\\\mathbf{x}$ at time $n$ from the target $\\\\mu$), which translates to smaller sampling variance. \n\n>### (Q2). The newly introduced iterate in (4b) generalizes the original algorithm and allows us to treat the resulting algorithm as a two-time-scale SA. However, I didnât see much motivation to introduce the new iterate. Could the author elaborate more on the motivation?\n\nAnswer: We thank the reviewer for commenting on the SRRW iterate (4b). This SRRW iterate generalizes the step size $\\\\gamma_n$ from $1/(n+1)$ to a general form $1/(n+1)^a$  for $a\\\\in(0.5,1]$, which is crucial for enhancing the algorithmâs flexibility and performance. This generalization allows for the exploration of the step sizes $\\\\beta_n=1/(n+1)^b =o(\\\\gamma_n)$ (case(i)), which is suggested as the best algorithmic choice among all three cases in simulation. Without this generalization, i.e., if we stick to the original step size of $\\\\gamma_n=1/(n+1)$ as in [Doshi et al. 2023], the case (i) becomes vacuous as it is impossible to choose the step size $\\\\beta_n=o(1/n)$ (such step size becomes summable, fundamentally violating the condition for the step size in any stochastic approximation setting). To reflect this response, we have added a new footnote #7 in the revision to elaborate on the motivation for the generalized step size in the SRRW iterates.\n\n>Doshi, V., Hu, J., & Eun, D. Y. (2023). Self-Repellent Random Walks on General Graphs--Achieving Minimal Sampling Variance via Nonlinear Markov Chains. International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2023.\n\n>### (Q3). If we set $\\\\alpha=\\\\infty$, from (6), the variance matrix would be zero. Could I say, in this case, $\\\\mathbf{x}\\_n$ actually converges to $\\\\mu$ at a faster rate than $\\\\gamma\\_n$ so that the CLT degenerates to zero? How to explain the intuition behind it?\n\nAnswer: It is crucial to clarify that our CLT results, as presented in Theorem 3.3, are specifically tailored for any 'givenâ $\\\\alpha < \\infty$, where $\\\\mathbf{x}_n$ converges to $\\\\mu$ at the exact asymptotic rate $\\\\gamma_n$ and the resulting covariance tends to zero for larger $\\\\alpha$ without actually reaching it. It's important to understand that our analysis does not extend to the case of $\\\\alpha=\\\\infty$ since the SRRW kernel in (3) is undefined. Consequently, the behavior of $\\\\mathbf{x}\\_n$ in such a setting, including its convergence rate to $\\\\mu$ and the resulting asymptotic covariance, falls outside the scope of our theoretical framework.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer 81Sf (2/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': "">### (Q3).

This is markedly different from Guo et al.âs approach, which integrates self-repellence into gradient descent iterates themselves for escaping saddle points.\n\nFinally, Itâs important to note that our version of self-repellence and that of Guo et al. are not directly comparable, as they serve different purposes within their respective algorithms, e.g., one is about the perturbation $\\\\theta_n$, and the other is about the choice of $X_{n+1}$ in the function $H(\\\\theta\\_n,X\\_{n+1})$. However, an intriguing possibility is the combination of both versions of self-repellence approaches to improve algorithmic performance.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer 81Sf (1/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your comments and for the time and effort you put into reading, understanding and evaluating our paper. We now answer the question posed by the reviewer.\n\n>### (Q1). The paper is mostly motivated by the recent progress of Doshi et al., and it is not clear what is the ""main"" novelty of this paper compared to the previous work (fundamentally). It seems to me that most results are refinements of Doshi et al. (while I agree that the setting is slightly different.) The authors may add a paragraph to highlight the main ""technical"" novelty of this paper.\n\nAnswer: While Doshi et al.âs analysis is foundational, it primarily utilizes existing CLT results for *single-timescale* SA with controlled Markov noise. Our work, in contrast, provides a first of its kind CLT result for the more complex *two-timescale* SA with controlled Markov noise (step-size cases (i) and (iii) fall into this category) marking a significant advancement. This CLT result is obtained via our original analysis detailed in Appendices D.2 and D.3, and does not build upon the analysis in Doshi et. al.. Without this, we cannot theoretically show the asymptotic covariance of the SA iterates $\\\\theta_n$ and prove that case (i) achieves $O(1/\\\\alpha^2)$ rate for its covariance and outperforms case (iii). The significance of this analysis is underscored right after Theorem 3.3 in our original paper, where we outline the technical challenges encountered when dealing with controlled Markov noise. In response to your valuable feedback, we have revised Contribution #2 in the introduction to delineate our technical innovations more clearly.\n\n>### (Q2). Also the parameter $\\\\alpha$ measures the ""heaviness"" of the self-repelling random walk, which is basically a hyper-parameter. It seems to be a bit strange to quantify the errors using $Poly(1/\\\\alpha)$ (provided that one sends $\\\\alpha\\\\to\\\\infty$ and I do have concerns on the real application in this regime).\n\nAnswer: Thank you for highlighting the concerns regarding the hyper-parameter $\\\\alpha$. We would like to clarify its role and implications in our analysis in the following three aspects:\n- **Role of $\\\\alpha$ in Asymptotic Covariance**: Our CLT results in Theorem 3.3 enable us to quantify how the asymptotic covariance of the error varies with $\\\\alpha\\\\geq 0$, for any given finite $\\\\alpha$. It is important to note that CLT analysis does not extend to the case of $\\\\alpha\\\\to\\\\infty$, even though the form of the asymptotic covariance matrix allows one to evaluate it at $\\\\alpha\\ = \\\\infty$. This is because setting $\\\\alpha$ to infinity would disrupt the continuity of the SRRW kernel $\\\\mathbf{K}[\\\\mathbf{x}]$ as stated in (3), and it would no longer be well-defined for any $\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in\\\\text{Int}{\\\\Sigma}$. The continuity of $\\\\mathbf{K}[\\\\mathbf{x}]$ with respect to $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is essential in our CLT analysis.\n\n- **Practical Implications of $\\\\alpha$**: In real-world applications, using large values of $\\\\alpha$ is not necessary. Our findings show that the asymptotic covariance in case (i) decreases at a rate of $O(1/\\\\alpha^2)$. This suggests that even moderate values of $\\\\alpha$ are sufficient to achieve small errors. For instance, in our empirical results shown in Figure 2(c), setting $\\\\alpha$ to $5$ already yields satisfactory performance. Increasing $\\\\alpha$ from $5$ to $20$ does not result in significant improvements in mean square error (MSE), as the MSE was already small enough for $\\\\alpha=5$.\n\n- **Drawbacks of Excessively Large $\\\\alpha$**: It\'s also important to consider the potential drawbacks of setting $\\\\alpha$ too large. As illustrated in Figure 2(b), larger $\\\\alpha$ values can actually slow down convergence in the initial stages of the training process. For example, when $\\\\alpha$ is set to $10$ or $20$, performance is slightly inferior to $\\\\alpha=5$ until $n\\\\approx 5Ã10^4$.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer MZm1'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Our sincere thanks for the in-depth review of our paper. We now answer the question posed by the reviewer.\n\n>### (Q1). I only have one very open ended question: is there any hope of getting finite sample bounds?\n\nAnswer: We think itâs very unlikely to obtain the finite sample bound for our SA-SRRW algorithm. In the new appendix B in the revision, we briefly demonstrate that the state-of-the-art non-asymptotic analyses all require globally Lipschitz mean field function for both iterates to derive the finite sample bounds. However, for our SA-SRRW algorithm (4), the mean field function $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}(\\\\mathbf{x})-\\\\mathbf{x}$ in the SRRW iterates (4b) is only locally Lipschitz continuous in $\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in\\\\text{Int}(\\\\Sigma)$ (i.e., the interior of the probability simplex) and we provide a detailed explanation of the local Lipschitzness in appendix B. There does not exist a uniformly bounded Lipschitz constant for $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}(\\\\mathbf{x})-\\\\mathbf{x}$ in terms of $\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in\\\\text{Int}(\\\\Sigma)$ . Thus, in this context, our SA-SRRW algorithm is unlikely to obtain finite sample bounds. Indeed, we believe that deriving any usable finite sample bound in this general area of two-timescale SA with controlled Markov noise for non-globally-Lipschitz kernels, would pose as one of important future direction in the literature, and clearly much beyond the scope of our paper now.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer XrEW (3/3)'}, 'comment': {'value': '>### (Q5). It would be nice if the authors provided some intuition as to why the $\\\\beta_n=o(\\\\gamma_n)$ step-size ratio can yield the $O(1/\\\\alpha^2)$ rate. Moreover, it would be nice if the authors spelled out precisely the dependence on the difference between the step-size exponents in their asymptotic rates (i.e. if $\\\\beta_n=n^{-b}$ and $\\\\gamma_n=n^{-a}$, how the rate actually depends on the difference between $a$ and $b$). If this difference does not affect the asymptotic rate, it would be nice to provide insight into how this difference might play out in practice.\n\nAnswer: For $\\\\beta_n=o(\\\\gamma_n)$ in case (i), the impact of the SRRW iterates on the SA iterates is primarily reflected in the correlation terms $\\\\mathbf{J}\\_{12}(\\\\alpha)$ and $\\\\mathbf{J}\\_{22}(\\\\alpha)$, as detailed in equation (55) and Lemma D.3 in Appendix D.2.2. These terms play a pivotal role in shaping the matrix $\\\\mathbf{U}\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\alpha)$ as follows:\n\n$$\\\\mathbf{U}\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\alpha)=\\\\mathbf{U}\\_{22}-\\\\mathbf{U}_{21} (\\\\mathbf{J}\\_{12}(\\\\alpha) \\\\mathbf{J}\\_{22}(\\\\alpha)^{-1})^T-\\\\mathbf{J}\\_{12}(\\\\alpha)\\\\mathbf{J}\\_{22}(\\\\alpha)^{-1}\\\\mathbf{U}\\_{12}+\\\\mathbf{J}\\_{12}(\\\\alpha) \\\\mathbf{J}\\_{22}(\\\\alpha)^{-1}\\mathbf{U}\\_{11}(\\\\mathbf{J}\\_{12}(\\\\alpha) \\\\mathbf{J}\\_{22}(\\\\alpha)^{-1})^T,$$\n\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{U}\\_{ij}$ is defined in (9) for $i,j\\\\in\\\\{1,2\\\\}$. Through algebraic computations, we derive the $O(1/\\\\alpha^2)$ rate for matrix $\\\\mathbf{U}\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\alpha)$ and in turn for the asymptotic covariance $\\\\mathbf{V}\\_{\\\\theta}^{(1)}(\\\\alpha)$.\n\nRegarding the difference in step-size exponents ($a$ and $b$ in $\\\\beta\\_n=n^{-b}$ and $\\\\gamma\\_n=n^{-a}$), our main CLT results in Theorem 3.3 indicate that for all three cases, the asymptotic covariances remain the same irrespective of the variations in $a$ and $b$. The key change lies in the asymptotic rates $\\\\beta\\_n^{1/2}$ and $\\\\gamma\\_n^{1/2}$ of the iterates. In practice, we indeed observe that for a fixed value $b$, the convergence speed in the initial training phase is affected by the different value of $a$. We take $b=0.9$ as an example. Choosing $a$ close to $0.5$ results in the slowest convergence since the SRRW iterates $\\\\mathbf{x}\\_n$ drastically vary in the initial period, potentially deviating from the target distribution $\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}$ and introducing huge bias to the SA iterates $\\\\theta\\_n$. As $a$ increases to $0.8$, we note the fastest convergence in case (i) in our simulation setup. However, further increases in $a$ (beyond $0.8$) gradually slow down the convergence since such choice of $a$ would get closer to cases (ii) and (iii). This empirical observation suggests that in practice, as $a$ increases in the range $(0.5,b]$, the convergence becomes faster but then decelerates beyond a certain point close to $b$ in the initial period. This necessitates careful fine-tuning of the step size in case (i) to achieve optimal performance.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer XrEW (2/3)'}, 'comment': {'value': '>### (Q3). While the analysis is on asymptotic covariance, could the authors comment on the likely finite-time convergence rate behavior of their SRRW-SA algorithm, and whether improvements (due to the SRRW) can be also shown in terms of finite-time convergence rates?\n\nAnswer: The current non-asymptotic analysis of two-timescale SA with controlled Markov noise cannot be applied to our SA-SRRW algorithm. Specifically, all the state-of-the-art non-asymptotic analysis requires that the mean field functions of both iterates are globally Lipschitz [7-9]. This globally Lipschitzness condition is in place even for finite-time bounds in the singe-timescale SA [10-12]. However, the mean field function $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}(\\\\mathbf{x})-\\\\mathbf{x}$ of SRRW iterates (4b) exhibits only locally Lipschitz continuity, where $\\\\mathbf{x}$ is in the interior of the probability simplex. This is due to the polynomial form $(x_i/Î¼_i)^{-\\\\alpha}$ inside $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}(\\\\mathbf{x})$, which was elaborated on in Appendix D [2] as a necessary condition to ensure scale invariance and local information reliance. This distinction is critical as it places our SA-SRRW algorithm outside the existing non-asymptotic analysis. To address this, we include additional insights in the paragraph following (4) in our revised manuscript and provide a detailed discussion in the new appendix B.\n\n>[7]. Doan, T. T.

The authors suggest that $\\\\beta_n=o(\\\\gamma_n)$ is the best step-size choice if a $O(1/\\\\alpha^2)$ decay rate in the asymptotic covariance is desired. However, if faster convergence is to be desired, a larger learning rate (i.e. larger $\\\\beta_n$) should always be picked, i.e. we would want to pick the maximal possible step-size required by the assumptions in the paper, i.e. $\\\\beta_n=O(1/n^{0.5+\\\\epsilon})$ for some $\\\\epsilon>0$ as close to 0 as possible, in which case $\\\\gamma_n$ can at best match the step-size of $\\\\beta_n$, meaning that we can only get $O(1/\\\\alpha)$ in the asymptotic covariance decay again. Could the authors comment on this possible issue?\n\nAnswer: In our paper, $\\\\beta_n=o(\\\\gamma_n)$ is shown to be the best step-size choice in terms of achieving smaller asymptotic error (captured via asymptotic covariance). These errors are smallest for choices of $\\\\beta_n=O(1/n)$, and not $O(1/n^{0.5+\\\\epsilon})$ for some close-to-zero $\\\\epsilon$, since the step sizes are also the scaling factors under which the finite asymptotic variance is characterized. Thus, larger learning rates actually lead to larger asymptotic variances as well; even though the initial convergence (to a level set around the solution) could be quicker, larger learning rates result in larger variances (larger level sets) for large enough time. This is also demonstrated by the extreme case of constant step size, where, without additional averaging, the SGD iterates may converge quickly, but only to a level set (neighborhood) around the solution, and not to the solution itself, and it is well known that the size of such neighborhood around the solution critically depends on the (asymptotic) variance of the iterates. Therefore, selecting the largest possible learning rate is not necessarily the most desirable.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer XrEW (1/3)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""We thank the reviewer for their detailed comments. Following are our detailed responses to the questions posed.\n\n\n>### (Q1). Could the authors comment a little bit more on the stability of the iterates? This is assumed to always hold, but as the authors point out, practical tricks are required to ensure this, in which case the theoretical analysis might also need tweaks.\n\nAnswer: We appreciate the reviewer's question regarding the stability of the iterates in our SA-SRRW algorithm, and we recognize the potential impact of practical tricks on our theoretical analysis. The stability of SRRW iterates $\\\\mathbf{x}_n$ in (4b) is always ensured through the truncation method in [1], where the detailed steps have been shown in [2]âs Appendix E with $\\\\gamma_n=1/(n+1)$. This analysis can be extended to generalized step size $\\\\gamma_n = 1/(n+1)^a$ for $a \\\\in (0.5,1]$ as well since it satisfies the step size assumption (A1) in [1]. \n\nHowever, the stability of the SA iterates $\\\\theta_n$ presents a more complex challenge. This is due to its dependency on the SRRW iterates $\\\\mathbf{x}_n$. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive stability analysis for $\\\\theta_n$ within the domain of two-timescale SA with controlled Markov noise. Even the latest result in this area, which provides only the almost sure convergence (no CLT result therein), still requires the stability assumption [3]. This situation mirrors the challenges faced in single-timescale SA literature, where establishing stability conditions often requires significant analytical effort, e.g., Chapter 4 in [4], [1], [5], [6]. \n\nTherefore, while we ensure the stability of the SRRW iterates using established methods, the stability of $\\\\theta_n$ under the two-timescale framework remains an open question. Addressing this would not only require modifying our theoretical analysis to accommodate practical algorithmic adjustments but also contribute significantly to the broader field of two-timescale SA, which we acknowledge as an important aspect of future work.\n\n>[1].

In practice, a moderate value of $\\\\alpha$ often strikes the right balance between reducing asymptotic covariance and maintaining efficient convergence in the initial phases of training. For instance, as observed in our simulations (Figure 2(b)), we noticed that when $\\\\alpha$ is set to larger values like 10 or 20, the performance initially lags behind that of $\\\\alpha=5$ until about $n\\\\approx 5Ã10^4$ iterations. In addition, asymptotic covariance in case (i) decreases at a rate of $O(1/\\\\alpha^2)$, implying that even moderate values of $\\\\alpha$ are sufficient to achieve small errors, e.g., $\\\\alpha=5$ in Figure 2(c). \n\nAs explained in the previous response, the stability of SRRW iterates can always be guaranteed through truncation method in [1] for any $\\\\alpha<\\\\infty$. Thus, although we do not have the stability of $\\\\theta_n$, due to the robust behavior of SRRW iterates, we speculate that large $\\\\alpha$ is unlikely to compromise the stability of $\\\\theta_n$.""}}, {'summary': {'value': 'This paper introduces a new distributed stochastic optimization algorithm, where the random walk guiding the sampling of gradients across the network uses Self-Repellent Random Walk (SRRW), a recently introduced family of nonlinear Markov chain.

If node $j$ has been visited more often, I think $x_j$, as the coordinate of a distribution vector, should be close to $\\mu_j$. I canât tell whether $x_j$ is larger than $\\mu_j$ or not.\u2028\u2028However, I acknowledge that the nonlinear kernel in (3) would encourage the algorithm to visit the states that are less visited, based on its expression.\n\n2. The newly introduced iterate in (4b) generalizes the original algorithm and allows us to treat the resulting algorithm as a two-time-scale SA. However, I didnât see much motivation to introduce the new iterate. Could the author elaborate more on the motivation?\n\n3. If we set $\\alpha=\\infty$, from (6), the variance matrix would be zero. Could I say, in this case, $x_n$ actually converges to $\\mu$ at a faster rate than $\\gamma_n$ so that the CLT degenerates to zero? How to explain the intuition behind it? \n\n4. From the simulation, it seems the larger $\\alpha$, the faster convergence. Is there any suggestion for a practical choice of $\\alpha$?\n\n5. If the $\\alpha$ is also updated, for example, we use $\\alpha_t$ at the iterate $t$ that increases at a carefully selected rate in advance (or perhaps could be updated using a third iterate). Can we accelerate the convergence rate of $\\theta_n$ so that its mean square error is faster than $\\beta_n$?\n\nI will increase my point to 8 if most of my questions are addressed.\n\n------------------------------------ Post rebuttal --------------\n\nThanks for the authors' clarification.  Most of my concerns and questions are well addressed, so I increase my point to 8.\nHowever, there are still two points I don't agree with the author.\n\nOne point I disagree with is that I think when $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, the kernel (3) is still well defined.\nIn this case, I think $K_{ij}(x) = 1$ if and only if $x_j/\\mu_j = \\arg\\min_{l} x_l/\\mu_l $.\nAs you can see, this kernel is reduced to a deterministic transition. \nI guess this reduction makes the system no longer random so that the CLT degenerates.\nOne property of this generation is that the variance matrix would converge to zero.\nThis actually is a good property from my perspective because it means that one could get a convergence rate faster than the step size.\n\nLet's do a simpler thought experiment. Let $X_t \\sim \\sqrt{\\beta_t} \\cdot N(0, c_t )$.\nIf the variance $c_t$ is non-zero (so that $c_t \\to 1$ w.l.o.g.), then the MSE of $X_t$ is dominated by the variance and is of order $\\beta_t$. \nIf the variance is (nearly) zero (say $c_t \\to 0$), then the MSE is dominated by a higher-order term and we have $E |X_t|^2$ converge faster than $\\beta_t$.\n\nBack to this paper, I guess the counterpart of $c_t$ in this paper is $1/\\alpha$. So, if we let $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, we would have $c_t \\to 0$. This is the reason why I ask whether increasing $\\alpha$ would fasten the convergence. The author's response works only when the optimal $\\alpha^{\\star}$ exists and is finite. However, the particular case I am interested in is when $\\alpha^{\\star} = \\infty$.\nI think that exploring the case where  $\\alpha^{\\star} = \\infty$ detailedly is worth a more detailed examination. \nIt is fine not to discuss this in this paper.""}, 'flag_for_ethics_review': {'value': ['No ethics review needed.']}, 'rating': {'value': '8: accept, good paper'}, 'confidence': {'value': '3: You are fairly confident in your assessment.

Typically, these random-walks are chosen to be Markov chains that asymptotically sample from a desired target distribution, and play a critical role in the convergence of the optimization iterates. In this paper, we take a novel approach by replacing the standard *linear* Markovian token by one which follows a *non-linear* Markov chain - namely the Self-Repellent Radom Walk (SRRW). Defined for any given 'base' Markov chain, the SRRW, parameterized by a positive scalar $\\\\alpha$, is less likely to transition to states that were highly visited in the past, thus the name. In the context of MCMC sampling on a graph, a recent breakthrough in Doshi et al. (2023) shows that the SRRW achieves $O(1/\\\\alpha)$ decrease in the asymptotic variance for sampling. We propose the use of a `generalized' version of the SRRW to drive token algorithms for distributed stochastic optimization in the form of stochastic approximation, termed SA-SRRW. We prove that the optimization iterate errors of the resulting SA-SRRW converge to zero almost surely and prove a central limit theorem, deriving the explicit form of the resulting asymptotic covariance matrix corresponding to iterate errors. This asymptotic covariance is always smaller than that of an algorithm driven by the base Markov chain and decreases at rate $O(1/\\\\alpha^2)$ - the performance benefit of using SRRW thereby *amplified* in the stochastic optimization context.

Our model achieves significantly improved RMSE for this variable. Additionally, both models' Accuracy (ACC) results demonstrate competitive performance across various variables.\n\n**Longer lead-time predictions**\n\nActing on the reviewers' another excellent suggestion, we carried out additional experiments focusing on longer lead-time predictions, specifically for 6-day and 3-day lead times. In this extended analysis, we included ClimaX predictions for comparative purposes. The findings indicate that temperature and potential variables (t, t2m, z) exhibit a relatively stable performance over longer forecast periods. However, it is observed that the reliability of wind direction variables (u10, v10) diminishes over extended time horizons. It's worth noting that ClimaX, while demonstrating remarkable stability in long-term predictions, exhibits lower performance than ClimODE. This suggests that ClimODE outperforms ClimaX, particularly in scenarios involving longer lead-time predictions.\n\nWe also address all specific questions, comments, and concerns raised by reviewers in our detailed individual responses for each reviewer.\n\nClimate prediction is arguably one of the most important challenges and opportunities for machine learning today and requires a collective effort and active engagement from our community. We're particularly pleased to acknowledge all the reviewers again for the very high quality of reviews across the board that have helped us take a step forward in this pursuit.

Those benchmarks are exceptional since they excel NWP results in many cases and have been tested/used even for recent disaster predictions. It is just like the LLM that, if it becomes powerful enough, everyone will be amazed and will use it. If the ultimate goal of this paper is to propose a strong SOTA model against existing models, it is strongly recommended to compare with those large models and consider adapting to this line in the future research.\n\nWe agree and are keen to compare these models as well. However, there are some practical hurdles: the large DL models have been trained with higher resolution data, and we cannot directly obtain comparable prediction trajectories due to different test data.\n\nThese large weather models demonstrate significant scale, requiring substantial computational resources, extensive pre-training, and other prerequisites. These requirements impose practical limitations on the training process. We argue that there is also value in more compact models (in our case up to 100x less parameters) that allow rapid and more accessible development for the community.\n\nWe would also like to emphasize that the primary goal of our work is to demonstrate the benefits of incorporating physical inductive biases in neural networks, and present a qualitatively improved model that has (i) solid foundations in physics, (ii) outputs principled uncertainty distributions, and (iii) is fundamentally continuous-time. We have also demonstrated good empirical performance. However, our primary goal is not to best other large climate foundations models in benchmarks, and we have chosen instead to focus on principled method developments and see perhaps in future these ideas be integrated into the large foundation models as well (indeed, recently NowCastNet incorporated autoregressive advection equations to its Transformer pipeline).\n\n> How does the model perform with long-term prediction, say, for 7 days or 14 days? The authors mention the emission source model as a strong inductive bias that prevents long-horizon forecast collapses and it seems to work based on the ablation study, so I wonder that.\n\n**Long-term prediction with ClimODE.** Great suggestion! We performed our main comparison with 6 days forecasts, and also include a 3 day reference values for comparison below. We see that our model accuracy drops relatively little over time. Also, ClimODE continues to perform better than ClimaX.\n\n|          |                   | RMSE        |                        | ACC         |          |\n|----------|-------------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|----------|\n| Variable | Lead Time (hours)   | ClimaX | ClimODE | ClimaX | ClimODE |\n| z  | 72| 687.0  | 478.7   $\\pm$ 48.3    | 0.73 | 0.88   |\n|    | 144| 801.9  | 783.6   $\\pm$ 37.3   | 0.58  | 0.61   |\n| t  | 72| 3.17 | 2.58   $\\pm$ 0.16    | 0.76 | 0.85   |\n|    | 144| 3.97  | 3.62   $\\pm$ 0.21   | 0.69  | 0.77   |\n| t2m  | 72| 2.87 | 2.75   $\\pm$ 0.49    | 0.83 | 0.85   |\n|    | 144| 3.38  | 3.30   $\\pm$ 0.23   | 0.83  | 0.79   |\n| u10 | 72| 3.70 | 3.19   $\\pm$ 0.18    | 0.45 | 0.66   |\n|    | 144| 4.24  | 4.02   $\\pm$ 0.12   | 0.30  | 0.35   |\n| u10 | 72| 3.80 | 3.80   $\\pm$ 0.22    | 0.39 | 0.63   |\n|    | 144| 4.42  | 4.42   $\\pm$ 0.10   | 0.25  | 0.32   |\n\nWe are grateful for your thoughtful review.

What makes it less predictive in the real world is that this equation comes with assumptions such as the homogeneity and isotropy of the fluid. In cases where these assumptions are violated, the equation might not hold perfectly. I am not certain whether relying too much on this physical equation would be optimal for modeling the complex dynamics of weather, especially in finer-granular resolution with more weather factors and potentially larger noises.\n\nThese are all great points, and we agree. We believe that a performant climate model likely needs to strike a balance between data-driven deep learning (often black-box) practises, and theoretical modeling and understanding of the underlying physics. Earlier methods, such as PanguWeather or GraphCast, lean quite heavily on the deep learning side. In contrast, our contribution is to combine neural networks with advection equations, which makes our modeling significantly more principled over relying solely on deep learning. \\\\\n\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first method that introduces principled continuous-time dynamics to the problem, and further research is needed to identify the extent of physics to be injected in the models. In our model the advection primarily contributes mass conservation, which we show empirically to be a very useful inductive bias.\n\n> Limited Physical Understanding: In all, the partial differential continuity equation is a general-form conservation equation rather than any specific equations explaining each weather factor. Other than that, because neural ODE is essentially still a black-box model due to using neural network, it remains hard to know, for example, the relationships and the interactions between different weather variables.\n\nGreat remarks, and we again agree. The advection conservation equations have two roles in our study. On one hand, their foundation in physics allows us to interpret and analyse the proposed model from new perspectives (to the deep learning community), as well as  understand the model predictions in terms of divergence, transport and gradient fields (as shown in Figure 1 and 2). On the other hand, the induced `mass' conservation ensures that predictions do not lose or gain value, stabilising them and providing us with improved empirical accuracy. We are excited to study the physical modeling choices further in future, and experiment with diffusion, source and sink fields as well.\n\nThe interdependency of climate variables is another incisive question. To demonstrate the couplings of quantities (i.e., wind, temperature, potential), we plot below the emission model  $\\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{pred}}(\\mathbf{x},t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$ pairwise densities averaged over space $\\mathbf{x}$ and time $t$. These effectively capture the correlations between quantities in the simulated weather states. These show that temperatures (t,t2m) and potential (z) are highly correlated and bimodal; the horizontal and vertical wind direction are independent (u10,v10); and there is little dependency between the two groups. We will include these plots in the appendix.\n\nPlot: https://postimg.cc/0McVK5r5\n\n> Since the paper mentions efficiency, I wonder how does the model perform with more parameters. Would the performance increase? Or, it is more like a nice small model to save us from excessive computational burden?\n\nThis is a great suggestion, and an interesting question. Given the current dataset we suspect that more parameters likely would not result in significantly improved performance.\n\nThat said, we are very interested in expanding the work to higher spatial resolutions, which surely would necessitate at least somewhat larger networks to be able to model the more fine-grained details. In principle, we expect that ClimODE could serve as a powerful and compelling foundation model for various climate prediction tasks by leveraging more data (e.g., historical data) and computation.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you very much for many excellent suggestions! We have acted on all of these, and additionally, address all your questions and comments below.\n\n> Limited Performance and Comparison: The proposed model, although surpasses vanilla Neural ODE and ClimaX, still cannot compete with IFS (ECMWF NWP), let alone bigger models such as FourCastNet and Pangu-Weather that have already reported better results than NWP. There lacks enough comparison to other models in general, such as Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (practiced by FourcastNet), previous weather forecasting methods like [1, 2], even models for similar tasks such as spatio-temporal traffic forecasting or video forecasting, etc. Comparison to Neural ODE is more of an ablation study and ClimaX is a weak baseline marginally better than ResNet. Comparing only with ClimaX is definitely not convincing enough.\n\n**Comparison with FourCastNet.** Thank you for the suggestion. We could not compare to PanguWeather (no public code, model files do not support our data resolution) or GraphCast (public repository seemed incomplete). However, we include an additional experiment compared to FourCastNet. To have comparable results, we re-trained the FourCastNet on our dataset and used their recommended training regime and hyperparameters. \n\nOur results reinforce the efficacy of ClimODE.

NowCastNet indeed operates as a generative model and to obtain uncertainty estimates one requires multiple samples and forward passes to obtain a scatter of outputs, whose summary statistics can be computed. However, for ClimODE, a single forward pass suffices for accurate uncertainty estimation. That is, our approach allows us to obtain reliable uncertainty estimates in a single pass without the need for repeated sampling that incurs extra costs and approximation errors.\n\n> In section 3.2, it's unclear why $\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_{k}(x,t)$ $=$ $\\ddot{u}_k (x,t)$  especially when $\\ddot{u}_k (x,t)$ is not a vector.\n\nGood catch: this is a typo. We will remove this remark. Fortunately, this does not affect our model equations.\n\n> In section 3.6, how is $\\tilde{\\dot{u}}(t_0)$numerically approximated from past states?\n\nWe compute $\\tilde{\\dot{u}}(t_0)$ by utilizing torchcubicspline (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/torchcubicspline) to fit data-points $\\{u_k(t_0 -2),u_k(t_0 -1),u_k(t_0) \\}$ in order to get a smooth derivative approximation.\n\n> Lacks training details for ClimaX as well as the training runtimes and number of GPUs used for ClimaX.\n\nWe train ClimaX on the same set of hyperparameters as described in their official paper on our set of data splits and inputs for a fair comparison.

Given that you state that Runge-Kutta can be used with a low computational cost, it would add more quality to the paper overall if you include it as well.\n\nWe utilize one-hour time resolutions for solving the ODE system, and finer time-stepping or higher precision solvers can (and perhaps should be) used.

While the conclusion sounds intuitive, it\'s not justified rigorously. The expectation is taken with respect to which density? I would expect the quantity to be preserved would be $\\int_{\\Omega} u_{k}(x,t)dV$, since that\'s the total quantity over the whole ""volume"" you\'re considering which should be preserved (e.g. when the integral over the volume becomes the mass). In any case, since this is a Machine Learning submission, it would be better if this part is thoroughly justified.\n\nThanks for pointing this out.

It would be better to include that limitation in the paper and acknowledge that while it is a strong inductive bias, it\'s hard to enforce in practice. This is further seen from Table 2 which shows that the error does increase dramatically with lead time and that suggests that ClimODE is better at inferring the true physics but not in mitigating the error propagation in long-term forecasts.\n\nThanks for pointing this out. To empirically study this, we analysed how our current model retains the mass-conservation assumption and computed the integrals $I_{k,t} = \\int u_k(\\mathbf{x},t)d\\mathbf{x}$ over time and quantities. We found out that the value is constant over time up to order of $10^{-12}$. Plot link: https://postimg.cc/w709xD9n\n\nThus it seems that our choice of second-order ODE with Euler with 1 hour increment is a good compromise in terms of accuracy and efficiency, but we agree that higher precision solvers should be preferred. We hypothesise that Euler is sufficient since our dynamics are relatively smooth (eg. Fig 6): the dynamics $\\dot{u}_k$ largely models the spatiotemporal trends in climate, while we offload the day-night fluctuations to the instantaneous emission model.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Many thanks for your constructive review. We address your concerns and incorporate your suggestions below. \n\n> For the model of FLOW VELOCITY (section 3.2), as we already know $\\dot{ \\mathbf{v}}_{k}(x,t)$ $=$ $\\ddot{u}_k (x,t)$\nwhy we still need to parameterize it? Is it because the computation of $\\ddot{u}_k (x,t)$ is too costly? There are also many methods that could be approximated. More discussion or claims are encouraged.\n\n**Need to parameterize the flow velocity.** Thank you for raising an excellent point. In an advection system the climate quantities $u(\\mathbf{x},t)$ are transported (moved and redistributed) around by a flow velocity $\\mathbf{v}(x,t)$, which is a vector field that points where the climate `mass' is moving. Given a known starting state $u$, the system evolution is fully determined by the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ by solving eq (2) forward in time.\n\nThe velocity field function is generally unknown, and we thus learn it from data by parameterising the the velocity function as a neural network $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x},t | \\theta)$. We also note that the remark that $\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_k = \\ddot{u}_k$ was a typo, and in general we cannot solve for $\\mathbf{v}$ by, e.g., interpolating the value $u$.  \n\nApologies for any confusion: we have fixed this typo and our model equations remain unaffected.\n\n> The model treats the advection PDE as independent for each task or quantity. However, in the intricate tapestry of climate dynamics, various quantities are interdependent. For instance, wind patterns can influence temperature fluctuations. The paper doesn't clearly illustrate how the proposed method addresses these inherent inter-correlations.\n\n**Explicating how ClimODE accounts for variable correlations.** This is another great point that we elucidate here. We present our equations for a single quantity $k$ at a time (for instance, equation (2)) because the convenient vector calculus notation $\\dot{u}_k - \\nabla \\cdot (u_k \\mathbf{v}_k)$ applies only to scalar $u$, and a `batch' version $\\dot{\\mathbf{u}}$ does not admit elegant notation. Nevertheless, our model is still able to consider the entire state vector $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, \\ldots, u_K)$ at the same time, and all $K=5$ climate quantities are affected by each other. This can be seen in equation (4), where the velocity change $\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}_k = f( \\mathbf{u}, \\ldots)$ of quantity $k$ depends on all state variables, and thus subsequently $\\dot{u}_k$ also depends on all state variables. Thus, for instance, wind can affect temperature and vice versa.\n\nTo demonstrate the emerging couplings of quantities (ie. wind, temperature, pressure potential), we plot below the emission model  $\\mathbf{u}^{\\mathrm{pred}}(\\mathbf{x},t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$ pairwise densities averaged over space $\\mathbf{x}$ and time $t$. These effectively capture the correlations between quantities in the simulated weather states. For example, these densities reveal that temperatures (t,t2m) and potential (z) are highly correlated and bimodal; the horizontal and vertical wind directions are independent (u10,v10); and there is little dependency between the two groups. We will include these plots in the appendix.\n\nPlot: https://postimg.cc/0McVK5r5\n\nAgain, thank you so much for your extremely constructive feedback.

Comparing only with ClimaX is definitely not convincing enough. \n\n2. Limited Physical Complexity: The partial differential continuity equation is indeed a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics as it describes how quantities such as mass, moisture, or energy are transported and conserved in the atmosphere over time and space. What makes it less predictive in the real world is that this equation comes with assumptions such as the homogeneity and isotropy of the fluid. In cases where these assumptions are violated, the equation might not hold perfectly. I am not certain whether relying too much on this physical equation would be optimal for modeling the complex dynamics of weather, especially in finer-granular resolution with more weather factors and potentially larger noises. \n\n3. Limited Physical Understanding: In all, the partial differential continuity equation is a general-form conservation equation rather than any specific equations explaining each weather factor.

In App. C.3, we now include an experiment that ablates the impact of the number of slots on the consistency loss. As the number of slots increases from 2 to 3 and 4, optimization of the consistency loss becomes more challenging, and its value grows. This is not unexpected as the number of possible latent slot combinations grows combinatorially with the number of slots, making sampling the space more challenging. Furthermore, as the consistency loss increases, we see worse performance on OOD metrics, as our theory suggests.

What is the effect of the width of the diagonal band in latent space, i.e., the effect of the training data\'s size (and diversity)?\n2. What happens if slot-supportedness is not fulfilled?\n\nWe address the first point in App. C.1 and show that a model trained with the consistency loss yields high OOD performance across different widths. On the other hand, a model trained without consistency loss requires a much wider band to reach the same OOD performance.\n\nWe address the second point in App. C.2 by creating a dataset in which there is a gap in the latent space such that it is no longer a slot-supported subset. In this case, we see that OOD reconstruction increases sharply in the region around this gap. \n\n___\n**Comment:** âHow does the method hold up on non-synthetic data?â\n\n**Response**:\nWe agree with the reviewer that understanding our results on non-synthetic data is important; however, this is challenging for two main reasons. Firstly, for real-world data, one does not generally have access to the ground-truth latents making our evaluation schemes inapplicable. Secondly, even if access to ground-truth latent information is available, our experiments require being able to sample latents densely from a slot-supported subset. Specifically, our experiments rely on sampling from a diagonal strip in the latent space with a small width. If such a region were sub-sampled from an existing dataset, this would leave a tiny number of data points that are insufficient to train a model. To this end, our experiments require access to a dataset\'s ground-truth renderer so latents can be sampled densely. This is not available in most cases, however. We now discuss this in a paragraph in App. B.6.\n\n___\n**Comment:** âWhat if you â¦ allow for a low-expressivity non-linear combination at the end for rendering?â\n\n**Response**:\nRegarding a âlow-expressivity non-linear combination at the end for renderingâ, we note that the softmax in the alpha-masking of Slot Attention in our experiments in Sec. 6.2 can be understood as just this. For these experiments, the model optimizes the consistency loss and includes a deterministic encoder, thus matching all theoretical assumptions except for _additivity_. In these cases, we found that the nonlinear combination leads to a steep increase in the isolated decoder OOD reconstruction error (See Fig. 5, left). Developing theory to allow for such nonlinear combinations is an important direction for modeling real-world data. We view our work as a crucial initial step in this direction.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Dear Reviewer, \n\nWe thank you for your positive review and your valuable feedback.

We aimed to highlight this in our discussion paragraph, âExtensions of Theoryâ.  While interactions between slots cannot be arbitrary, it is likely that further degrees of interaction may be allowed beyond additive interactions. We view this as an important direction for future work and believe that the current work constitutes a crucial step towards a more general result.\n\n___\n**Comment:** ""Are there results in more complex environments?""\n\n**Response**:\nUnderstanding our theoretical results for more complex data is indeed important for better understanding its applicability.

Compositional decoders are special cases of additive decoders (see App. A.7) and thus share the same limitations: They cannot perfectly model objects with complex interactions such as occlusion or reflection. Irreducibility, on the other hand, roughly states that parts of the same object share information. We argue that this assumption is a more fundamental property of objects and will thus be valid more generally for multi-object scenes.\n\n**Comment:** âAdditive decoder limits modeling of complex object interactions and relations.â\n\n**Response**:\n\nAs noted in our âExtensions of Theoryâ paragraph in the Discussion section, we agree with the reviewer that additivity is indeed insufficient for modeling more complex object interactions.

More principled schemes could improve results.â\n\n**Response**:\n\nAs noted in our âExtensions of Experimentsâ paragraph in the Discussion section, we agree regarding the limitations of our consistency loss implementation and approaches for improving it. One such approach could be to learn a prior over latent slots and sample slot combinations more rigorously according to their likelihood under the prior. This could avoid sampling implausible combinations; however, such a scheme is challenging as it relies on the likelihood of being valid for OOD combinations of slots. Another possibility would be to include heuristics to directly filter combinations based on prior knowledge of the data-generation process, e.g., to filter objects with similar coordinates that would intersect. We believe that further explorations in such directions are a promising and important direction for future work to make this method practical for more complex datasets.

Methods based on latent slots have in fact been shown to scale to more complex settings (e.g., [1, 2]); however, we agree regarding the scalability of the consistency loss, which we aimed to highlight in our âlimitations of experimentsâ paragraph. We have included a figure in App. C.3 highlighting the challenges in scaling this loss as the number of objects increases. Regarding computational costs, the loss requires additional passes through the encoder and decoder as well as computation of the encoderâs gradients wrt. the loss.

The theoretical analysis is similar to those proving the compositional generalizability of any additive inference models.\n\nThe novel step is to enforce the compositional generalizability of encoders by learning with the synthesized data in new compositions of latent slots/symbols given the generalizable decoder. So, in order to learn an encoder that can generalize to unseen combinations of objects, they first build a dataset with new compositions of latent symbols/slots by permutating learned latent symbols/slots in the training distribution. They then generate the fake images using the ""supposedly generalizable"" decoders on new combinations. The encoder is trained to learn the inverse mapping of the decoder.

To bridge this gap, we present MathVista, a benchmark designed to combine challenges from diverse mathematical and visual tasks. It consists of 6,141 examples, derived from 28 existing multimodal datasets involving mathematics and 3 newly created datasets (i.e., IQTest, FunctionQA, and PaperQA). Completing these tasks requires fine-grained, deep visual understanding and compositional reasoning, which all state-of-the-art foundation models find challenging. With MathVista, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of 12 prominent foundation models. The best-performing GPT-4V model achieves an overall accuracy of 49.9%, substantially outperforming Bard, the second-best performer, by 15.1%. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the superiority of GPT-4V is mainly attributed to its enhanced visual perception and mathematical reasoning. However, GPT-4V still falls short of human performance by 10.4%, as it often struggles to understand complex figures and perform rigorous reasoning. This significant gap underscores the critical role that MathVista will play in the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of tackling mathematically intensive and visually rich real-world tasks.

We are encouraged by your recognition of our contributions in presenting a comprehensive benchmark and conducting a large evaluation of existing models under various settings.\n\nWe hope to engage further with you to enhance our paper. Your valuable comments have been addressed as follows:\n\n### W1: The dataset ""amalgamates"" mathematical and visual reasoning\n\nThank you for your insightful comment. We would like to clarify that our objective in designing these tasks was to **mirror the intricacies of real-world situations**, where mathematical and visual reasoning are often interlinked and not easily separable. A prime example is K-12 math education, which notably emphasizes visual learning through the use of pictures, diagrams, and real-life scenarios. This approach underscores the significance of integrating visual elements with arithmetic tasks to accurately assess a child\'s math and reasoning skills. Moreover, our dataset reflects the practical applications found in data analysis, rich with figures, and scientific discovery that involves deducing theorems from multimodal raw results.\n\nOur MathVista benchmark aims to **fill a unique gap by providing a more holistic and comprehensive evaluation** of LLMs and LMMs. This approach is particularly relevant for advancing AI systems capable of tackling multifaceted and contextually rich tasks. We believe that the combined evaluation of mathematical and visual reasoning offers novel insights into the overall capabilities of these models, contributing significantly to our understanding of AI in complex problem-solving scenarios. \n\nWe have conducted **detailed analyses to dissect model performances on individual aspects within these integrated tasks** on MathVista (as detailed in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, and Appendices F.2, F.3, and F.4). These analyses provide insights into how models navigate the challenges of visual understanding and mathematical reasoning both individually and in tandem.\n\n### W2: The low human performance on the benchmark\n\nThank you for your observation regarding the human performance on our benchmark, MathVista. The 60.3% accuracy achieved by humans indeed reflects the challenging nature of the tasks, which include advanced topics such as college-level mathematics and complex scientific reasoning. We would like to clarify that this outcome reflects **the intrinsic difficulty of the tasks rather than issues with data quality**.\n\n1. **Task complexity:**\n\nOur benchmark is designed to be challenging, featuring tasks that require advanced mathematical reasoning within complex visual contexts. These tasks often involve high-level concepts drawn from **college curricula (10.8%)** and **scientific reasoning (10.7%)**, going beyond standard high school level problems. The tasks in MathVista are multidimensional, requiring not only mathematical skills (i.e., 41% of problems involve two math reasoning types), but also an in-depth understanding of visual elements. 44.8% of the questions are free-form, without option candidates. All these natures significantly raise the difficulty bar.\n\n2. **Data quality assurance:**\n\nTo ensure the integrity of our data, we **have implemented rigorous quality control measures**. Our team engaged with domain experts from STEM graduates and a professional data labeling company. We developed three professional tools for data labeling and collection (see Figures 22-24 in Appendix C.2, C.3, and C.4), ensuring accuracy and reliability. To label if the candidate examples involve mathematical reasoning, each is labeled with three expert annotators, and we did an inter-annotator agreement analysis. Our analysis yielded a Fleiss Kappa score of 0.775, indicating a substantial level of inter-consistency. We took multiple rounds of checks and validations by domain experts. We further checked 500 examples and all seemed doable in the sense that they had enough information to solve the question. For more data curation details, please refer to Section 2 and Appendix C.\n\n3. **Benchmarking against human performance:**\n\nThe benchmark\'s purpose is to push the boundaries of current AI capabilities in mathematical reasoning within visual contexts. The 60.3% human accuracy rate **sets a realistic and challenging target for AI models**, emphasizing the need for improvement in this area. It is also worth noting that the human baseline was established by engaging qualified annotators with at least a high school diploma, ensuring a reasonable level of competence.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe it accurately reflects the challenging nature of the tasks in MathVista and the need for advanced AI capabilities in this domain.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Continued Response to Reviewer Vb5K: Dissecting Math Reasoning and Evaluating GPT-4V'}, 'comment': {'value': ""### W3: The takeaways from Table 2 regarding the seven math reasoning types\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion to delve deeper into the insights derived from the seven types of fine-grained reasoning abilities detailed in Table 2. We **have added this discussion regarding the seven math reasoning types in Appendix F.2**, and provided more details for the analysis regarding different visual contexts in Appendix F.3 and grade levels in Appendix F.4, in [the revised paper (click to see the pdf)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=KUNzEQMWU7).\n\nOur analysis indeed provides several key takeaways regarding seven math reasoning types for different models:\n\n1. **GPT-4V** outperforms other baseline models in most mathematical reasoning categories, except for logical reasoning and numeric commonsense reasoning. \n\n2. **Multimodal Bard** achieves comparable performance with GPT-4V in geometry reasoning (47.8% vs. 51.0%) and algebraic reasoning (46.5% vs. 53.0%), highlighting its enhanced abilities in comprehending geometry diagrams and performing algebraic calculations.\n\n3. Among open-source LMMs, **LLaVA** achieves the best overall accuracy on MathVista and the highest fine-grained scores for problems in geometry reasoning, logical reasoning, and statistical reasoning. However, these scores still substantially lag behind GPT-4V and Multimodal Bard, indicating a gap in the overall effectiveness of these open-source models compared to more advanced proprietary systems. \n\n4. Despite this, **LLaMA-Adapter-V2**, tied with LLaVA, outperforms GPT-4V by 2.7% in logical reasoning, and InstructBLIP beats GPT-4V by 0.3% in numeric commonsense, suggesting that specific enhancements in open-source models can lead to superior performance in certain niches. \n\n5. **LLaVAR**, being on par with Multimodal Bard, which is specifically designed to enhance capabilities in detecting OCR texts and symbols from various forms, including scientific domains, further illustrates the potential of targeted improvements in open-source LMMs to achieve competencies that rival or even exceed those of their proprietary counterparts in specialized areas.\n\n6. **CoT GPT-4**, augmented with OCR texts and Bard captions, performs well in scientific reasoning, achieving a gain of 26.2% over random chance, showcasing its superiority in domain-specific knowledge. This performance suggests a significant trend where the integration of specialized functionalities, such as OCR text recognition and advanced captioning, into LLMs enhances their applicability and accuracy in specific domains. \n\n7. **PoT GPT-4** outperforms Multimodal Bard in categories such as arithmetic reasoning, logical reasoning, numeric commonsense reasoning, and statistical reasoning. This superior performance is attributed to its ability to generate high-quality codes for precise mathematical reasoning, illustrating the effectiveness of integrating advanced coding capabilities into language models for complex problem-solving tasks.\n\n### W4: Results of GPT-4V\n\nThank you for your interest in the results of GPT-4V, which is indeed a crucial part of our study.

The key findings are summarized as follows:\n\n1. Notably, GPT-4V achieves an overall accuracy of 49.9%, significantly outperforming other models such as Bard by 15.1%. This highlights GPT-4Vâs advanced capabilities in visual perception and mathematical reasoning.\n\n2. GPT-4V's superior performance is particularly evident in tasks **requiring complex visual understanding and compositional reasoning**, which are areas where other models typically struggle. However, it is important to note that GPT-4V still shows **a gap of 10.4% compared to human performance**, especially in tasks involving intricate figures and rigorous reasoning.\n\n3. GPT-4 demonstrates **an ability of self-verification**, which is not present in concurrent models. Self-verification enables GPT-4V to inspect a set of candidate answers and identify the one that is valid and meets all the given constraints. It also allows GPT-4V to verify the validity of key reasoning steps, and explore alternative approaches if any invalid result is detected.\n\n4. We found **the application of self-consistency** in GPT-4V is instrumental in correcting calculation mistakes, rectifying visual perception errors, and mitigating hallucinations \n\n5. We found that GPT-4V is effective in **engaging in multi-turn goal-directed conversations with users**.

The tasks in MathVista are designed to **require not just basic mathematical understanding but also deep, compositional reasoning combined with visual perception**, and they incorporate **advanced concepts such as college-level mathematics (10.8%) and complex scientific reasoning (10.7%)**, presenting significant challenges even for well-qualified individuals.\n\nAs elaborated in Appendix E.6, we **conducted a meticulous study to gauge human performance** on MathVista. We utilized Amazon MT, where each question from the testmini subset was assigned to five annotators with a track record of completing over 5,000 HIT tasks and maintaining an acceptance score above 0.99, ensuring high-quality results. The study comprised five test questions and two qualification questions, all to be completed within 20 minutes. Only annotators who correctly answered the qualification questions were included in the final analysis. Furthermore, we selectively considered results from annotators with at least a high school diploma, aligning with the complexity of MathVista's questions, which are predominantly high-school (30.9%) and college-level (10.8%).\n\nAddressing your specific query, among the instances where humans did not answer correctly, only 1.9% of questions received empty responses, while 3.3% were somewhat ambiguous.

The VQA tasks, being knowledge-intensive, demand a comprehensive understanding that extends beyond mere visual perception. For example, they often require the comprehension of detailed profile information of celebrities. Similarly, the GPS tasks necessitate accurate interpretation of diagrams, application of domain-specific theorems, and precise calculations.\n\n**(2) For different math reasoning types:**\n\n| | **Random Chance** | **Human** | **Gain (%)** |\n| - | - | - | - |\n| STA (statistical) | 20.9 | 63.9 | +43.0 |\n| ARI (arithmetic) | 18.7 | 59.2 | +40.5 |\n| NUM (numeric) | 19.4 | 53.8 | +34.4 |\n| SCI (scientific) | 32.0 | 64.9 | +32.9 |\n| **GEO (geometry)** | 31.4 | 51.4 | **+20.0** |\n| **ALG (algebraic)** | 33.1 | 50.9 | **+17.8** |\n| **LOG (logical)** | 24.3 | 40.7 | **+16.4** |\n\nThe lowest gains were observed in geometry, algebraic, and logical reasoning, suggesting these areas are particularly challenging for human solvers.\n\n**(3) For different grade levels:**\n\n| | **Random Chance** | **Human** | **Gain (%)** |\n| - | - | - | - |\n| Elementary School | 20.9 | 63.9 | +43.0 |\n| High School | 18.7 | 59.2 | +40.5 |\n| **College** | 19.4 | 53.8 | **+34.4** |\n\nAt the college level, the human performance showed a gain of only 34.4% over random chance, indicating the inherent difficulty of these advanced problems.\n\nIn light of these insights, we recognize the importance of **extending our analysis to include the performance of human experts, i.e., graduate students**. This expansion will help us understand how individuals with advanced educational backgrounds tackle these complex problems. We anticipate that including grad students in our study will provide a more nuanced understanding of human capabilities in mathematical reasoning within visual contexts, especially for the more challenging tasks that currently exhibit lower human accuracy rates.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer Vb5K: Disentangling Skills on MathVista'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Dear Reviewer, \n\nWe sincerely appreciate your insightful and constructive review of our paper.

We agree that this interplay of skills, while reflective of real-world applications, presents a complex evaluation scenario.\n\nIn the current version of MathVisa, we have endeavored to address this issue by including annotations where possible. Notably, **85.6% of the questions** are accompanied by annotations sourced from their original datasets. **These annotations serve various purposes, ranging from specifying OCR texts and attributes within visual figures to providing textual solutions that elucidate the mathematical reasoning steps involved**. These annotations offer a level of disentanglement in the evaluation process. For instance, examples sourced from TabMWP (17) are annotated not only with ground truth tabular parsing results to verify models' understanding of the visual context but also with natural language solutions that illuminate the multiple intermediate steps leading to the final answers.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of these annotations, which serve the purpose of evaluating visual or textual reasoning:\n\n| **ID** | **Source dataset** | **Annotation** | **Visual?** | **Textual?** |\n| - | - | - | - | - |\n| 1 | A-OKVQA | A list of rationales | Yes | Yes |\n| 2 | ChartQA | Text in the chart figure | Yes | / |\n| 3 | CLEVR-Math | The program that synthesizes the figure | Yes | / |\n| 4 | DocVQA | OCR text with the bounding boxes in the document image | Yes | / |\n| 5 | FigureQA | Structured attributes that generate the figures | Yes | / |\n| 6 | Geometry3K | Unified logic forms for the diagram and question text | Yes | / |\n| 7 | GeoQA+ | A Natural language solution | / | Yes |\n| 8 | IQTest | A Natural language solution | / | Yes |\n| 9 | KVQA | Named entities and the wiki captions | / | Yes |\n| 10 | MapQA | OCR text in the map graph | Yes | / |\n| 11 | PaperQA | The linked paper | / | Yes |\n| 12 | ParsVQA-Caps | The translation of the non-English question | / | Yes |\n| 13 | PlotQA | OCR text with the bounding boxes in the plot figure | Yes | / |\n| 14 | SciBench | The LaTeX format solution | / | Yes |\n| 15 | ScienceQA | A natural language solution with a related lecture | / | Yes |\n| 16 | Super-CLEVR | The program that synthesizes the figure | Yes | / |\n| 17 | TabMWP | A natural language solution and the diagram parsing results | Yes | Yes |\n| 18 | TextVQA | Detected objects from the image | Yes | / |\n| 19 | TheoremQA | A related theorem with a detailed definition | / | Yes |\n| 20 | TQA | A lecture that explains the question | / | Yes |\n| 21 | UniGeo | An expression that generates the answer | / | Yes |\n| 22 | VQA-AS | Fine-grained question and answer types | / | Yes |\n| 23 | VQA-RAD | Biological organ parts | Yes | / |\n| 24 | VQA2.0 | Fine-grained question and answer types | / | Yes |\n\nFurthermore, in response to your suggestion, we are exploring the possibility of **expanding our dataset to include more detailed annotations** for both visual (such as fine-grained captions) and textual aspects (including natural language and program solutions)**. This enhancement aims to facilitate a more nuanced evaluation of models' capabilities, specifically in terms of their ability to isolate and apply distinct cognitive skills such as visual perception, textual understanding, and mathematical reasoning.\n\nWe hope these efforts and future enhancements will address the concerns raised and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of AI model performance in complex, multimodal scenarios.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Continued Response to Reviewer 2daf: Expanding LLM Few-Shot Evaluations and Contextualizing MathVista'}, 'comment': {'value': ""### W3: LLMs can be evaluated on a broader range of K-shot settings\n\nThank you for your insightful suggestion regarding the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) over a broader range of K-shot settings.

For instance, CoT Claude-2 experienced a significant drop of 3.4% when increasing from 2 to 4 shots.\n\nOverall, while there might be marginal improvements, larger numbers of few-shot examples do not consistently benefit the LLMs on MathVista. Some settings even exhibit unstable performance drops, suggesting that **the quality of the augmented information plays a more critical role for augmented LLMs**.

We appreciate this opportunity to clarify these aspects in the context of current trends in multimodal benchmarking:\n\n1. **Benchmark size in context**: MathVista is an evaluation benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of existing LMMs. In the future, we plan to develop strategies to enhance it further. It's important to note that recent multimodal benchmarks for evaluating LMMs tend to be smaller in size, especially when compared to earlier datasets. This trend can be attributed to:\n\n - **Model scale**: Modern LMMs are extremely large in terms of parameter count, often ranging from 10 to 100 billion. Evaluating such large-scale models on extensive datasets (e.g., 10K examples) is not practically feasible due to computational and resource constraints.\n\n - **Quality over quantity**: In the realm of LMM evaluation, the diversity and quality of benchmarks are prioritized over sheer size. A smaller, well-curated dataset can often provide more insightful evaluations than a larger, less diverse one.\n\n2. **The Role of finetuning data**: The exclusion of finetuning data in recent benchmarks, including ours, aligns with current development trends in LMMs, which favor instruction tuning over traditional finetuning.\n\n3. **Contextualizing MathVista within recent benchmarks**: To provide context, we compare MathVista with other recent multimodal benchmarks:\n\n | **Benchmark** | **Release date** | **Size** | **Finetuning data** |\n | - | - | - | - |\n | MMBench [1] | 2023-07-12 | 2,974 | No |\n | MM-Vet [2] | 2023-08-02 | 205 | No |\n | VisIT-Bench [3] | 2023-08-12 | 592 | No |\n | Bingo [4] | 2023-11-06 | 321 | No |\n | K-I VQA [5] | 2023-11-13 | 4,290 | No |\n | **MathVista (Ours)** | 2023-09-28 | 6,141 | No |\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10635\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02490\n\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06595\n\n[4] https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03287\n\n[5] https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07536\n\nMathVista is a comprehensive benchmark, notable for its specific focus on evaluating mathematical reasoning in visual contexts.

We appreciate your acknowledgment of the novelty and motivation of our benchmark, the comprehensive taxonomy and the diversity of our dataset, our methodological approach, along with the diverse evaluated models.\n\nIn response to your constructive feedback, we **have enriched our paper with additional in-depth analyses and results with additional 67 pages** in [the updated submission (click to see the pdf)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=KUNzEQMWU7). We hope these enhancements will address any remaining concerns. Your thoughtful comments have been addressed as follows:\n\n### W1: Details regarding inter-annotation consistency and rigorous review for 3 new datasets\n\nIn response to your query, we provide the following details:\n\n1. **Initial review**: After collecting the raw examples, a group of four graduate students specializing in STEM fields conducted an initial manual review. This review focused on verifying the relevance, clarity, and accuracy of the examples.\n\n2. **Inter-annotation consistency checks**: To ensure consistency in annotation, we employed a two-step process. Initially, each dataset was independently annotated by three reviewers, resulting in **a high inter-annotation consistency rate of 99.2%**. Specifically, **among the newly collected 736 questions, only 6 exhibited disagreements in the annotated answers**. Then, these discrepancies were resolved through discussion among the entire review team, ensuring a consensus was reached on each example.\n\n3. **Expert validation and iterative refinement**: The datasets underwent scrutiny by two domain experts in math. These experts evaluated the datasets for complexity, relevance, and the appropriateness of the mathematical concepts involved. Finally, the datasets were iteratively refined to revise any remaining issues.\n\nThis rigorous review process was designed to ensure the highest quality and consistency of the datasets, thereby providing a robust benchmark. We believe these measures address your concerns about the reliability of our data collection and annotation process.\n\n### W2: Few-shot performance for LMMs\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback regarding the evaluation of few-shot learning capabilities in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We acknowledge the importance of this aspect in benchmarking the performance of these models. \n\nIn our initial submission, we did not include few-shot performance results for LMMs due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Initial experimental observations**: Our preliminary experiments indicated that models like OpenFlamingo performed poorly on our dataset. This was largely attributed to a lack of specific instruction tuning, which is crucial for few-shot learning.\n\n2. **Recent developments in few-shot Learning**: The ability of LMMs to support few-shot learning is a recent advancement. Notably, top-tier models like Multimodal-Bard and GPT-4V only recently started supporting few-shot learning in a scalable manner.\n\n3. **Resource limitations**: GPT-4V, which was released for API access on November 6, 2023, currently imposes a daily limit of 100 calls. This limitation makes it impractical to conduct a complete evaluation of our testmini set, which consists of 1000 examples.\n\nTo address your suggestion, we **conducted an initial study on the few-shot learning ability of the LMM model IDEFICS** on MathVista. The results are as follows:\n\n| Model | 0-shot | 2-shot (new) | 3-shot (new) | 4-shot (new) |\n| - | - | - | - | - |\n| IDEFICS-9B-Instruct | 19.8% | 23.7% | 23.4% | 24.1% |\n\nThe data shows a modest improvement with increased shot numbers, suggesting some potential benefits of few-shot learning for LMMs on MathVista.\n\nHowever, **recent studies highlight the instability and sensitivity of LMMs in few-shot settings [1]**. For example, a significant accuracy drop was observed in models like BLIP-2 and InstructBLIP (Flan) when applying 4-shot in-context learning, especially in tasks requiring common sense reasoning.\n\nHere are some specific performance statistics on VQA with Commonsense Knowledge:\n\n| Model | 0-shot Acc (%) | 4-shot Acc (%) | Gain (%) |\n| - | - | - | - |\n| MiniGPT-4 | 29.31 | 25.96 | **-3.35** |\n| BLIP-2 | 39.06 | 25.95 | **-13.11** |\n| InstructBLIP (Vicuna) | 41.02 | 48.90 | +7.88 |\n| InstructBLIP (Flan) | 47.96 | 41.67 | **-6.29** |\n| LLaVA | 61.93 | 58.32 | **-3.61** |\n| GPT-4V | 64.28 | 62.01 | **-2.27** |\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07536\n\nThese variations may stem from the specific training techniques or the nature of few-shot examples used, affecting the in-context learning performance of LMMs. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of LMMs, **the consistent benefits of few-shot learning remain an open question**. We are committed to **expanding our evaluations to include advanced LMMs like Multimodal Bard and GPT-4V** as more resources become available.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Continued Response to Reviewer juci: Adding Limitation Discussion and Enhancing Model Comparative Analysis'}, 'comment': {'value': ""### W4: A comprehensive discussion of the limitations of the benchmark\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback. In response, **we have included a detailed discussion of the limitations of our benchmark, MathVista, in Section 4** of the [the updated version (click to see the pdf)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=KUNzEQMWU7), which we iterate below.\n\nMathVista represents a significant advancement in combining mathematical and visual tasks, challenging even for models like GPT-4V, particularly in understanding complex figures and performing rigorous reasoning. Despite our progress in evaluating model performance, we recognize several limitations:\n\n1. A primary limitation is **dataset coverage**. While MathVista covers a wide range of tasks and visual contexts, gaps may exist in the representation of certain mathematical problem types and visual scenarios. \n\n2. Additionally, the dataset's emphasis on mathematical reasoning within visual contexts, especially in domains like science and advanced mathematics, requires a more **labor-intensive data collection** process than what is typical for textual-only or general-purpose datasets. Consequently, the **scalability and generalizability** of our benchmark to other domains present challenges. \n\n3. The heterogeneity of data sources, from which we sourced **annotations** for 85.6% of examples (as indicated in Table 1), leads to **a lack of uniformity in format and structure**. For example, the annotations could be logic forms of the problem parsing from Geometry3K, natural language solutions from TabMWP, and theorems from TheoremQA.\n\nIn future iterations, we hope to **broaden the scope of MathVista** to include a more diverse range of problems and visual contexts and to **provide unified and comprehensive annotations**. As part of our ongoing research process, we are committed to continually **updating and refining the benchmark** based on community feedback. This includes **improving data quality and adapting the leaderboard** to reflect advancements and new models in the field.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are limitations to our current approach, MathVista represents a significant step forward in the field. We are dedicated to continuously improving our benchmark to better understand and enhance the capabilities of AI in mathematical and visual reasoning.\n\n### W5: An analysis of why specific models perform better than others (and what features of each model contribute to performance)\n\nThank you for emphasizing the importance of a detailed comparative analysis of different models. In our original submission, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of representative models:\n\n- Section 3.2 provides an analysis of the **overall performance of various models**, including the best LLM (GPT-4), the best Augmented LLM (PoT GPT-4), open-source LMMs, Bard, and the best LMM (GPT-4V).\n\n- In Section 3.5, we presented **a detailed success and failure analysis of Multimodal Bard** with human annotations. We discovered that 44.6% of its predictions were incorrect with flawed explanations, and hallucinations were present in 49.6% of these incorrect explanations.\n\n- A quantitative study comparing the performance of **Multimodal Bard and Augmented GPT-4** was also conducted in Section 3.5.\n\n- We conducted a qualitative analysis examining model performance across **different math reasoning types** (Appendix F.2), **visual contexts** (Appendix F.3), and **grade levels** (Appendix F.4).\n\n- An ablation study in Appendix F.5 explored **how LLMs can benefit from augmented visual information**, such as OCR and captions.\n\nIn [the updated version of our paper (click to see the pdf)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=KUNzEQMWU7), we have included an additional 67 pages offering **an in-depth study of the strengths and weaknesses of GPT-4V, Bard, LLaVA, and LLaMA-Adapter-V2**, primarily detailed in Appendix G.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer juci: Incorporating GPT-4V Results and Enhanced Revisions'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Dear Reviewer, \n\nThank you for your constructive comments.

We hope these updates address your concerns, possibly prompting you to adjust your rating.\n\n### W1: Adding GPT-4V(ision) results\n\nThank you for your comments. We have included a comprehensive study of GPT-4V in the revision, showcasing **both quantitative and qualitative results**. The main findings are highlighted as follows:\n\n- GPT-4V outperforms other models like Bard, achieving 49.9% accuracy, notably higher by 15.1%.\n- Its superiority is due to improved visual perception and mathematical reasoning abilities.\n- However, it still lags behind human performance by 10.4%, struggling with complex figures and rigorous reasoning.\n- GPT-4V introduces an ability of self-verification to verify and refine the intermediate reasoning steps.\n- The model's use of self-consistency helps correct visual and calculation errors, though it's less - effective in complex visual contexts.\n- In multi-turn human-AI interactions on MathVista, GPT-4V effectively uses hints to guide conversations, correct errors, and handle complex contexts.\n\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the updates highlighted in blue on the main pages and Appendix G in [the updated submission (click to see the pdf)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=KUNzEQMWU7).\n\n### W2: The methods have been superseded by recent prompting methods\n\nIn this paper, our aim is to evaluate the capabilities of **mathematical reasoning within visual contexts**. The **multimodal evaluation** framework led us to choose 9 large multimodal models (LLMs) as our primary models. We focused on evaluating the latest LLMs, including GPT-4V, released on September 25, 2023, and Multimodal Bard, released in late July 2023.\n\n\nWe also evaluated three large language models as **question-only baselines** in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, employing chain-of-thought and program-of-thought prompting strategies. The best-performing LLM baseline achieved an accuracy of only 26.0%, highlighting that the **main limitation of current LLMs is their inability to understand visual contexts**, as evidenced in our MathVista benchmark.\n\n\nConsequently, we explored augmented LLMs enhanced with external tools, representing a cutting-edge research area in LLMs. The top-performing augmented LLM (PoT GPT-4) attained only 33.9% accuracy, showing a significant 16.0% gap compared to GPT-4V. Our detailed study in Section 3.5 indicates that for current augmented LLMs, **the primary bottleneck is the incorrect augmentation information from external visual models**.\n\n\nGiven the multimodal nature of our benchmark and the notable performance gap between augmented LLMs and GPT-4V, our evaluation predominantly focused on multimodal models on MathVista. This approach is due to the fact that **recent prompting methods for LLMs are not suitable in this context**. We sincerely hope this response adequately addresses your concerns.\n\n### W3: Lacking related work and references\n\nThank you for your comments regarding the related work and references.

This diversity spans across source datasets, mathematical reasoning types, visual contexts, and task types. Our dataset is described as **comprehensive** (R4-iJ4P), **well-designed**, and **relatively large** (R3-Vb5K), structured under an identified taxonomy (R2-2daf & R4-iJ4P). We are particularly pleased to see R1-juci and R2-2daf highlight the **novelty** of the three newly curated datasets that address gaps in existing datasets.\n\nThe **comprehensive evaluations** conducted under various settings with a large number of existing LLMs and multimodal LLMs, including SoTA models such as miniGPT-4, LLaVA(R), Bard, and Instruct-BLIP, have also been appreciated by all reviewers.\n\nFurthermore, we are delighted that all reviewers have emphasized the significant **contributions of our work**. R1-juci notes that our paper studies **an important field**, and the curated datasets contribute to comprehensive and diverse testing. R2-2daf remarks on the **well-motivated** and relatively novel construction of MathVista. R3-Vb5K points out the paper focuses on a specific topic and defines the problem well, which is **important** for LLM evaluation. Lastly, R4-iJ4P values the consolidation of existing datasets into a **comprehensive** benchmark.\n\n### Added GPT-4V Results\n\nFollowing the suggestions of R1-juci and R3-Vb5K, we have included **a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative study of GPT-4V(ision)** on our MathVista benchmark in [the updated submission (click to see the pdf)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=KUNzEQMWU7). The new findings are highlighted as follows:\n\n- GPT-4V emerges as the best-performing model, achieving **an overall accuracy of 49.9%**, substantially outperforming Bard, the second-best model, by 15.1% (see Table 2 on Page 7). \n\n- Our in-depth analysis indicates that the superiority of GPT-4V is primarily due to its **enhanced visual perception and mathematical reasoning** capabilities (see Figure 1 on Page 2, Appendix G.3 and G.4 on Pages 56-96).\n\n- Despite its achievements, GPT-4V still **falls short of human performance by 10.4%**, often struggling with complex figures and rigorous reasoning (Table 2 on Page 7).\n\n- We highlight **the new ability of self-verification** in GPT-4V, absent in existing LMMs. This feature allows GPT-4V to verify the validity of primary reasoning steps and explore alternative approaches if any invalid results are detected, demonstrating its potential in solving rigorous reasoning and theorem-proving tasks (Appendix G.5 on Pages 97-102)\n\n- Our research into **the application of self-consistency** with GPT-4V shows that it is instrumental in rectifying visual perception errors, correcting calculation mistakes, and mitigating hallucinations. However, self-consistency is less effective when GPT-4V faces challenges in interpreting complex visual contexts or extracting salient information from images. (Appendix G.6 on Pages 103-108)\n\n- In examining GPT-4Vâs application for **multi-turn human-AI interaction** in MathVista, we found that GPT-4V effectively uses hints to guide conversations and generate desirable results. It can rectify visual perception errors, reassess reasoning steps and calculations, correct misinformation with user-provided domain-specific knowledge, and aggregate intricate contexts over multiple turns in human-AI dialogues.

While this is appealing due to the lack of modeling requirements, such methods can be sample inefficient, making them impractical in many real-world domains. On the other hand, model-based control techniques leveraging accurate simulators can circumvent these challenges and use a large amount of cheap simulation data to learn controllers that can effectively transfer to the real world. The challenge with such model-based techniques is the requirement for an extremely accurate simulation, requiring both the specification of appropriate simulation assets and physical parameters. This requires considerable human effort to design for every environment being considered. In this work, we propose a learning system that can leverage a small amount of real-world data to autonomously refine a simulation model and then plan an accurate control strategy that can be deployed in the real world. Our approach critically relies on utilizing an initial (possibly inaccurate) simulator to design effective exploration policies that, when deployed in the real world, collect high-quality data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this paradigm in identifying articulation, mass, and other physical parameters in several challenging robotic manipulation tasks, and illustrate that only a small amount of real-world data can allow for effective sim-to-real transfer.",Oral 1B,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=jNR6s6OSBT,https://openreview.net/forum?id=jNR6s6OSBT,jNR6s6OSBT,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'This paper presents an approach to address an important problem in real-world RL environments: What data should the agent collect from the real world to improve the policy in a simulator?

However, for parameters other than these ideal parameters, we allow the behavior of the simulator to vary significantly from that of the real world.\n\n[1] Yevgen Chebotar, Ankur Handa, Viktor Makoviychuk, Miles Macklin, Jan Issac, Nathan Ratliff, Dieter Fox.

Note that the Fisher Information encodes the interaction between parameters, and how jointly varying parameters affect the distribution. Thus, minimizing the inverse trace of the Fisher Information matrix naturally incentivizes exploration that jointly learns coupled parameters.\n\nEstimating the parameters from a rollout trajectory then depends on the used SysID method and the number of compute budgets available for sampling the simulator.

No approaches explicitly require the model to be fully learned. \n2. It would be great to baseline against a Bayesian model-based RL like Thompson sampling (16.6 in [1]).

It is known that there is a fundamental tradeoff between minimizing standard online regret (i.e. the amount of reward achieved in every online interaction compared to the best possible reward achieved) and exploring to learn the optimal policy: to learn the optimal policy as quickly as possible, one must often explore in a way that incurs large regret (see e.g. Proposition 4.3 of [1] below for a formal discussion of this). Our aim is to explore so as to learn the optimal policy as efficiently as possible and, as such, given the above dichotomy, our approach may not minimize regret (collect a large amount of reward) during exploration. Indeed, in tasks such as rod balancing this is clearly visible: our exploration policy does not aim to pick up the rod (which is required to collect reward), but instead seeks to push it, as this provides more informative data. This is in sharp contrast to the majority of existing sim2real methods we are aware of, which aim to minimize regret during exploration, typically by simply transferring a policy from sim which aims to solve the goal task, and is a key advantage of our approach over such methods.\nOn whether or not our approach can identify the best policy as quickly as possible, we do not have a formal proof. However, we remark that 1) our approach will collect data to optimally minimize parameter estimation error (see our reply to Reviewer zEL2) and 2) our approach will achieve a significantly faster rate for learning the best policy than existing sim2real approaches which do not explicitly explore as ours does, as is shown by Proposition 4.3 of [1]. There is in fact a subtle and interesting tradeoff between finding the best policy and estimating parameters accuratelyâcertain parameters may be more relevant to finding the best policy than others, and finding the best policy at the optimal rate exploration should be focused particularly on these parameters (this is formalized in the context of linear dynamical systems in [1]). Incorporating this in our method is beyond the scope of this work but is an exciting direction for future work.\n\n(b) Whether or not the parameter is identifiable depends on the properties of the given environment. It is possible that two different parameters induce identical distributions over trajectories, in which case the true parameter will not be identifiable. We make no assumptions on whether or not the necessary assumptions for identifiability are met. We do remark, however, that in cases where the true parameter is not identifiable, the optimal policy for the downstream task on these simulators would be identical (since for the optimal policies to differ there must be a difference in trajectory distributions). Thus, in cases when the true parameter is not identifiable, identifying it is irrelevant to solving the downstream task, and so will not affect our methodâs ability to succeed on this task.\n\nWe will add further discussion on these points to the final version of the paper.\n\n[1] Wagenmaker, Andrew J., Max Simchowitz, and Kevin Jamieson.

You find the distribution that maximizes likelihood for domain randomization. It seems to me that without some sort of entropy maximization term in the objective, or bootstrap, you would just end up with an MLE objective, whereas it seems like you want to find the Bayesian posterior of models given data. Can you comment on how your objective relates to that of finding a Bayesian posterior?â__\n\nWe make several remarks on this question. First, our parameter estimation procedure presented in Section 4.2.1 is relatively standard in the literature, see e.g. reference [1] below. Second, we take a frequentist rather than Bayesian perspective in this work: we assume there is a single true parameter that corresponds to real-world physics, and aim to estimate this parameter and use this estimate to perform policy optimization. In such settings, parameter estimators such as the MLE (which our estimator can be seen as a computationally feasible version of) are known to achieve the optimal estimation rates. Furthermore, our parameter estimation procedure is simple, scalable, and works well in practice. We are not aware of any precise connection between our estimation procedure and finding a Bayesian posterior, however.\n\nAssuming access to a well-specified prior over parameters, one could also take a Bayesian approach, and replace our estimator with the posterior estimate (e.g. similar to [2]). Such an approach could be incorporated into our framework with some small modifications, but in general, such Bayesian methods are more computationally demanding due to the computational challenges of Bayesian inference. Given this increased computational burden and the effective performance of our estimator in the frequentist setting we consider, we did not consider Bayesian methods in this work.\n\n[1] Yevgen Chebotar, Ankur Handa, Viktor Makoviychuk, Miles Macklin, Jan Issac, Nathan Ratliff, Dieter Fox.

Furthermore, the approach warrants a better intuitive explanation. As I understand it, the Fisher Information objective attempts to quantify the sensitivity of model parameters to trajectories expected given some policy. Therefore, maximizing this objective yields a policy that, when executed, yields the maximum additional information about the model parameters.â__\n\nThis is correct. As described in Section 3, the inverse Fisher information matrix serves as a fundamental lower bound on parameter estimation error, so exploring to maximize the Fisher information will collect data that will yield the most accurate estimate of the unknown parameters.\n\nIntuitively, the Fisher information quantifies the sensitivity of the trajectory distribution to the unknown parameter. Note that the Fisher information is defined in terms of the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to the unknown parameter. Thus, trajectory distributions for which the Fisher information is large correspond to trajectory distributions that are very sensitive to the unknown parameters, i.e., trajectory distributions that are significantly more likely under one set of parameters than another. By exploring to maximize the Fisher information, we, therefore, will collect trajectories that are maximally informative about the unknown parameters, since we will observe trajectories that will be significantly more likely under one set of parameters than another.\n\n\n__âLack of baselining/adequate discussion of other methods that use the Fisher information objective. The statement âAs compared to these works, a primary novelty of our approach is the use of a simulator to learn effective exploration policiesâ seems too strong and overstated given that there are entire fields dedicated to this, and âthe application of our method to modern, real-world robotics tasksâ is an inadequate claim to novelty.â__\n\nIt is certainly the case that using the Fisher information matrix to guide exploration has been proposed before (as our related work makes clear), and, in addition, the use of simulators to aid in real-world robotic learning is also common practice. However, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to combine the advantages of using high-fidelity simulators to aid in real-world robotics with active Fisher information-guided exploration for parameter estimation. \n\nIn particular, essentially all the works we have cited that rely on the Fisher information matrix to direct exploration (a) do not make use of prior information encoded in simulators to aid in exploration and (b) either do not provide real-world experimental justification for their methods or, if they do, consider only very simple toy problems. In contrast, essentially all the works we are aware of that aim to use simulators to aid in real-world robotic tasks do not perform the type of directed exploration we are proposing to estimate the unknown parameters, but instead use the simulators in a more naive manner, typically by simply transferring a policy that is trained in sim to solves the goal task. Our work can be seen as bringing together these directionsâdemonstrating that classical works on active parameter estimation can be combined with modern sim2real techniques to solve real-world robotic problems.\n\nIf the reviewer is aware of further works that are more relevant to compare to what we have missed in our related work, providing these references would be extremely helpful so we can better situate our work in the existing literature.'}}, {'comment': {'value': '__âMore detail on why the Fisher Information is used vs other methods (observability Grammian, Kalman Filter covariance).â__\n\nAs described in Section 3, the inverse Fisher information matrix is a fundamental lower bound on the difficulty of parameter estimation and, in addition, serves as an upper bound when the estimator is, for example, the maximum likelihood estimate. Given this, to minimize parameter estimation error (which is the goal of our exploration procedure), we should aim to explore so as to maximize the Fisher informationâdoing this will collect data that produces the most accurate estimate of the unknown parameters. Thus, in short, maximizing the Fisher information is the mathematically optimal thing to do if the goal is to minimize estimation error. While criteria other than the Fisher information may be used to direct exploration as the reviewer suggests, they lack this optimality property, and would not necessarily collect data that yields the best possible parameter estimate.\n\nWe also remark that using the Fisher information to guide the data collection has a long history in the theory of statistics and experiment design. We refer the reviewer to works such as [1] and [2] below for further discussion of this, as well as formal justification of the argument we have presented above.\n\n[1] Luc Pronzato and Andrej Pazman.

I understand that exploration precisely minimizes that effect, but the probabilistic model should be able to capture the lack of information in out of distribution data. Currently, the only uncertainty comes from the noise if I understand correctly. â__\n\nWe assume the simulator perfectly matches the real environment for some existing setting of unknown parameters (cf. Section 3), i.e., the true environment can be modeled by some setting of the simulator. As such, our estimation problem reduces to estimating this unknown parameter, and we do not consider out-of-distribution trajectories since, if we are able to identify the true parameter, the distribution of trajectories generated by the simulator will match the one generated by the real environment. This assumption underlies a variety of applications of sim2real transfer, which assume that the simulator (with appropriately chosen parameters or distributions of parameters) can effectively model the real world, allowing for policy transfer from sim to real [1, 2].\n\nIn cases where this does not hold, training a policy in sim is often still a valuable starting point for learning in real [3]. In such settings, learning a targeted distribution of simulator parameters to train a policy for deployment and finetuning the resulting policy in real often leads to improved performance [3, 4]. While such settings violate our assumptions, our exploration procedure would nonetheless generate informative data to learn such targeted distributions of simulator parameters.\n\n[1] Yevgen Chebotar, Ankur Handa, Viktor Makoviychuk, Miles Macklin, Jan Issac, Nathan Ratliff, Dieter Fox.

The method decomposes a cuboid into 3 plane equations and estimates those by 1) sampling points, 2) fitting a model, and 3) evaluating the model under all available points (c.f. RANSAC). This process is repeated until a threshold criteria or a maximum number of iterations is met. From the plane equations, we can extract the position and orientation of the rod.\n\n[1] https://github.com/leomariga/pyRANSAC-3D/'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""__âWhile the experimental section is one of the strengths due to the evaluation in a realistic robotic scenario, the methods should also be evaluated on standard benchmarks for comparison, such as HalfCheetah.â__\n\nStandard benchmarks like HalfCheetah donât include varying physics parameters and, therefore, do not cover the tasks we aim to solve. As shown in the follow-up experiments [Appendix Fig. 10d], our method yields directed exploration toward state transitions affected by the changing physics parameters.\n\n__âFurthermore, the work of Kumar2019 does not seem to be related to exploration with mutual information as stated in this work.â__\n\nThe mutual information of a distribution over physics parameters $\\Phi$ and corresponding trajectory distribution $\\mathrm{T}$ is defined as:\n$I(\\Phi|\\mathrm{T}) = H\\[\\Phi] - H[\\Phi|\\mathrm{T}]$ with $H[\\cdot]$ the entropy. With $H[\\Phi]$ a fixed quantity, we can approximate $H[\\Phi|\\mathrm{T}]$ by learning an estimator $q_{\\theta}(\\phi|\\tau)$ from data parameterized by $\\theta$ and predicting the physics parameters $\\phi$ from a trajectory $\\tau$ (c.f. [1]). Minimizing the prediction error of estimator $q$ over $\\theta$ (c.f. [2]) then corresponds to maximizing the mutual information.\n\n__âThe baseline used [Kumar2019] seems very weak (in Fig 4 it does not explore at all).â__\nThe reason [2] performs poorly on our tasks lies in the data used to train the estimator. [2] uses object-centric primitives to collect the data, e.g., the robot always pushing the rod. Every trajectory is, therefore, somewhat informative about the rod's center of mass.\nSince we assume no access to object-centric primitives, we instead use random exploration to collect the initial data and train the estimator. The data now also contains uninformative trajectories from which the parameters cannot be estimated, e.g., because the robot did not interact with the rod. Due to the long horizon, large state and action space, however, the estimator overfits to all trajectories, being equally certain/uncertain about informative and uninformative trajectories. Now, training a policy using the estimator log-likelihood as a reward leads to the policy learning the initial uninformative random exploration behavior used to collect the data.\n\n\n[1] Benjamin Eysenbach, Abhishek Gupta, Julian Ibarz, Sergey Levine.

However, due to the similarities in the process, those papers should be discussed and, ideally, included in the comparison.__\n\n__I do not fully understand the reference to REPS as that is a model-free RL method. There is no transition model estimation.\nâ__\n\nWe would like to note that ASID is not quite in the same realm as a model-based RL algorithm. Instead, it considers exploring and collecting data so as to identify the parameters of a physics-based *simulator* (such as MuJoCo or PyBullet), rather than an end-to-end model as most model-based RL algorithms would do. In the following, we discuss 1) the conceptual difference of ASID from model-based exploration in terms of explorative behavior and model extrapolation, and 2) provide empirical evidence.\n\n_1) Conceptual difference of ASID from model-based exploration_\n\nASID fundamentally differs from model-based exploration in the problem setting. Model-based exploration typically leverages fully learned models to guide exploration with the goal of achieving coverage in the state space. The exploration methods proposed by [1] [2] use a learned ensemble of forward models and their disagreement to learn multiple exploration policies that together cover the state space. The collected data is then used to train a downstream task policy. In contrast, our approach relies on the use of an existing physics-based simulator and explores to identify specific unknown parameters in the simulator (e.g. mass, friction coefficients), rather than learning a full model. Our exploration policy searches out state transitions that are most affected by a change in the underlying physics parameters [Appendix Fig. 10c, 10d]. We then roll out a single trajectory in the real world to identify the parameters of the simulator. We use a physics simulator because it extrapolates to unseen states in contrast to a fully learned model [Appendix Fig. 11]. \n\nThis means we don't learn a dynamics model anywhere in our pipeline and use a model-free black box optimization method (REPS) to identify the physics parameters of our simulator. However, we'd like to note that using a simulator in the process can be seen as a very specific instance of a model-based approach.\n\n_2) Empirical Evidence_\n\nWe construct an experiment to differentiate ASID from Model-based active exploration (MAX) [1]. The environment contains four spheres out of which the red sphereâs friction parameters are varied while keeping the parameters of the three blue spheres fixed. As in our previous experiments, the robot uses delta endeffector control (x,y) and is equipped with a peg instead of a gripper [Appendix Fig. 9].\n\nInvestigating the exploration behavior, we show that MAX aims to cover the state space through multiple policies throughout training. Since it uses the disagreement between fully learned dynamics models, it gets distracted by novel states induced by the movement of all spheres (red and blue) [Appendix Fig. 10a, 10b]. In contrast, our method based on the Fisher information yields a single policy that seeks out the sphere affected by the changing physics parameters (red) and ignores the irrelevant spheres (blue) even if they lead to novel states [Appendix Fig. 10c, 10d].\n\nWith the collected data of both exploration methods, we train a forward dynamics model $s_{t+1} = f_{theta}(s_t,a_t)$. We model $f_{theta}$ as a three-layer MLP and train using the MSE loss until convergence. When evaluated on out-of-distribution trajectories, i.e., trajectories not included in the training data, we find the model to be extremely inaccurate [Appendix Fig. 11]. While the simulator extrapolates to unseen states and correctly predicts the movement of the sphere, the model hallucinates movement even when the endeffector does not interact with it at all [Appendix Fig. 11c, 11d]! These findings make ASID preferable to a purely model-based approach.\n\n[1] Pranav Shyam, Wojciech JaÅkowski, Faustino Gomez. Model-Based Active Exploration.

Furthermore, the policy shows surprising generalization capabilities to sphere locations unseen during training [Appendix Fig. 12]. Furthermore, [Fig. 4] shows that our policy learns to cover the entire space, allowing it to generalize to changes in, e.g., patch locations.\n\nThe task policy generalizes to scenarios seen during training.

To showcase this, we evaluate different training checkpoints of our policy training in [Appendix Fig. 10d].

In particular, if dynamics take the form $s_{h+1} = f(s_h,a_h)$, as is the case in the setting we consider, then it is often reasonable to assume that there is some small Gaussian perturbation of the state (this is a common assumption, for example, in much of the control theory literature, e.g. canonical settings such as LQG). Given this, our simplified expression for the Fisher Information in Section 4.1 is in fact not a simplification but is exact. In our experiments, we did not observe that using this approximation resulted in a performance loss, even when training a simulator that does not precisely exhibit Gaussian noise.\n\n\n__âThe text states that the system isn\'t using a differentiable physics engine.

I can see the benefit of using a physically-informed model in a robotics setup. Clearly it is an advantage. However, when evaluating this kind of setups, one has to evaluate the scenario where there are mismodelling errors. For example, most robot models asume rigid-body dynamics, while real life dynamics in high acceleration/forces scenarios suffer from elastic behaviors and therefore are non-Markovian. If the setup is robust, as you said, the policy should be useful (even if suboptimal), but you have to show robustness to mismodeling errors that can make the solution diverge from the actual dynamics.\n\nAlso, because you are not learning any policy in section 4.2.1, I wouldn\'t say that you are using REPS. Instead, if I understood correctly, you are doing supervised learning using natural gradients (which also includes the KL bound). In fact, when you want to do trajectory matching, such as in apprenticeship learning and inverse reinforcement learning, the least-squares loss is problematic, and previous work actually tries to minimize the KL divergence between tau_sim and tau_real directly (see for example: Boularias, Abdeslam, Jens Kober, and Jan Peters.

The challenge with such model-based techniques is the requirement for an extremely accurate simulation, requiring both the specification of appropriate simulation assets and physical parameters. This requires considerable human effort to design for every environment being considered. In this work, we propose a learning system that can leverage a small amount of real-world data to autonomously refine a simulation model and then plan an accurate control strategy that can be deployed in the real world. Our approach critically relies on utilizing an initial (possibly inaccurate) simulator to design effective exploration policies that, when deployed in the real world, collect high-quality data.

"['Satwik Bhattamishra', 'Arkil Patel', 'Phil Blunsom', 'Varun Kanade']",ICLR,Understanding In-Context Learning in Transformers and LLMs by Learning to Learn Discrete Functions,https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19741,2024," In order to understand the in-context learning phenomenon, recent works have adopted a stylized experimental framework and demonstrated that Transformers can match the performance of gradient-based learning algorithms for various classes of real-valued functions. However, the limitations of Transformers in implementing learning algorithms, and their ability to learn other forms of algorithms are not well understood. Additionally, the degree to which these capabilities are confined to attention-based models is unclear. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether the insights derived from these stylized settings can be extrapolated to pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we take a step towards answering these questions by demonstrating the following: (a) On a test-bed with a variety of Boolean function classes, we find that Transformers can nearly match the optimal learning algorithm for 'simpler' tasks, while their performance deteriorates on more 'complex' tasks. Additionally, we find that certain attention-free models perform (almost) identically to Transformers on a range of tasks. (b) When provided a teaching sequence , i.e. a set of examples that uniquely identifies a function in a class, we show that Transformers learn more sample-efficiently. Interestingly, our results show that Transformers can learn to implement two distinct algorithms to solve a single task, and can adaptively select the more sample-efficient algorithm depending on the sequence of in-context examples. (c) Lastly, we show that extant LLMs, e.g. LLaMA-2, GPT-4, can compete with nearest-neighbor baselines on prediction tasks that are guaranteed to not be in their training set.",Oral 2A,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ekeyCgeRfC,https://openreview.net/forum?id=ekeyCgeRfC,ekeyCgeRfC,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'This paper provides a thorough empirical study on the in-context learning (ICL) ability of transformers for learning boolean functions, adding to the line of recent works that study ICL with transformers on certain simple function classes. \n\nApart from the setting being different from existing works (learning boolean functions) and demonstrating the amazing ICL capabilities of transformers, this work provides several additional interesting results on (1) comparison between transformers and other sequence architectures and baselines; (2) a finding about the limitations of transformers (on learning parity functions); (3) a study of the in-context sample efficiency and algorithm selection phenomenon through the ""teaching sequence"" settings; (4) A study of ICL in LLMs used in practice (such as GPT-4 and LLaMa-2), both with trainable embedding functions and directly through prompting.

Among the Boolean function classes we considered, Parity is the most difficult in some sense (as discussed in Section F) but it is still difficult to have preemptively predicted all architectures (not just Transformers) would fail in such a manner. \n\nThe statement âit\'s been well known that parity is computationally hard to learn and various prior work has shown empirical evidence on how Transformers struggle to optimize for parity, hence I don\'t agree thatâ ignores a lot of aspects of the results presented in our work. To begin with, if they are computationally hard to learn then how have previous works [1, 2, 3] found that Transformers trained from scratch perform well on the task. There are differences in the complexity of learning Parity-n and Parity-(n, k). As discussed in Section F of the paper, the hardness of learning Parities is primarily associated with the results that learning Parity-n requires $2^{\\Omega(n)}$ queries and learning Parity-(n, k) requires $n^{\\Omega(k)}$ queries in some restricted models of learning. Note that if $k$ is very small then it is a computationally tractable problem and hence previous empirical results [1, 2, 3] are with Parity-(n, k) types of problems. \n\nIn our experiments, you can note that the values of $n$ and $k$ are quite small (compared to those considered in earlier works) since the number of in-context examples is limited. Hence, FFNs+SGD succeed in solving the Parity-(10, 2) problem but no architecture is able to perform beyond chance-level accuracy in the in-context setting.\n\n\n\n\n[1] Simplicity Bias in Transformers and their Ability to Learn Sparse Boolean Functions.  \n[2] Inductive Biases and Variable Creation in Self-Attention Mechanisms.  \n[3] Hidden Progress in Deep Learning: SGD Learns Parities Near the Computational Limit.  \n\n\n""*re LSTM/attention-free networks: I agree with the authors â¦in non-Transformer models"", and including the discussion you have in the response would be nice.*""\n\nWe agree and we will add the discussion in the draft in a couple of hours.\n\n\nre comparison between Bai et al., I understand the training â¦ The current comparison in the paper wasn\'t clear enough to me, and including these points would be helpful.\n\nOkay, we will add the discussion to the paper in a couple of hours.\n\n\n\n""*re teaching sequences: I\'d like to get some further clarification please:\nThe authors replied ... in the paper please?*""\n\nThe results are not present in the paper currently but we will include it in the final version.

The main point of the experiments with teaching sequences provided altogether in the beginning is to check whether the model can use the entire teaching sequence and predict with perfect accuracy for the following examples which are randomly sampled from some arbitrary distribution. When we permute all examples then there is no longer a teaching sequence in the sequence of in-context examples.\n\n\n""*Also, have you tested on unseen teaching sequences? i.e. divide the set of teaching ... of the set of examples for both train and test.*""\n\nThe teaching sequences in the training and test sets are almost always different. The teaching sequence is determined by the target function and even for say Conjunction, the probability of the same Conjunction appearing during both training and evaluation is exponentially low. For instance, for our experiments with teaching sequences on Conjunctions, the experiments involve input dimensions of 75 where there are $3^{75} > 10^{35}$ Conjunctions (and associated teaching sequences). Hence, even if the model observes a million Conjunctions during training, most of the target functions and teaching sequences during evaluation will be unseen.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the further discussions, and I apologize for my late reply!\n\n- **re learnability of parity**: what I meant is that it\'s been well known that there is a computational-statistical gap for parity and various prior work has shown empirical evidence on how Transformers struggle to optimize for parity, hence I don\'t agree that ""We are not aware of any other precisely defined function classes where Transformers fail and which are known to be PAC-learnable in polynomial time."" as stated in the reply to Reviewer fGea.\n    - Also as a minor clarification, re contradicting results of Liu et al. 23: I was referring to the optimization challenge pointed out in Liu et al. 23, e.g their Fig 3(b), and hence there is no contradiction. \n- **re LSTM/attention-free networks**: I agree with the authors that the results in their work are different from the empirical study you have in this work.

In simplified terms, we find that for Conjunctions, Transformers implement an algorithm which is similar in principle to a known PAC-learning algorithm for learning Conjunctions but it does not follow it exactly. \n\n**Simplified Description**. The classical algorithm for learning Conjunctions starts with a hypothesis with all literals in it and it iteratively removes literals based on positively labelled examples. We apply a simple approach to approximate the Conjunction applied by the Transformer model to make its prediction while learning in-context and observe a similar behaviour where it always starts with all literals and progressively drops literals as it sees many positive examples finally converging to the correct one and achieving perfect accuracy.

The in-context examples can be viewed as a training set for Transformers (for in-context learning). Similarly, the same examples are provided as a training set to the FFN and optimized with gradient-based methods. In both cases, the goal of the examples is to provide information about the target labelling function. An algorithm dependent on the teaching sequence is task-specific in the sense that it requires the teaching sequence to be in the training set otherwise it is not guaranteed to work.\n\nThe comparison with FFN is unfair for all the problems in Table 1 since the hypothesis space of FFNs is not restricted to the class of functions in the learning problem. In contrast, during the pretraining (or meta-learning) stage, Transformers (or other models) are provided with the observation that the inputs are always labelled by functions of a particular class (e.g. Threshold functions, Conjunctions, etc). Nonetheless, FFNs+GD still perform better on learning multiple tasks such as Threshold functions, Integer-halfspace and Sparse Parity. This indicates that the performance of Transformers (and other models) is suboptimal in those tasks. We do not disagree that comparing FFNs on training examples with teaching sequence is unfair as well but it just seems like a point that is worth clarifying and is hence presented as a note in the main paper and as a supporting result in the appendix. \n\n\n(Q3f) *""I\'d like to clarify which empirical evidence supports the â¦ behaviors to be considered as ""two algorithms"", as opposed to merely being a manifestation of OOD behaviors.""*\n\nWe believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that their behaviour is different. For Conjunctions, as mentioned earlier, you can explicitly construct two algorithms (a) one for general distribution over inputs or functions and (b) another which is dependent on teaching sequence. The qualitative difference is that for algorithm (a) (independent of teaching sequence), we are likely to observe a gradual increase in performance for arbitrary distributions over inputs (such as Figure 6 (top-left)) or with teaching sequences (Figure 3 left). In contrast, algorithm (b) can be guaranteed to achieve perfect accuracy right after observing the teaching sequence (Figure 2 left) but poor accuracy when such teaching examples are not provided (Figure 3 centre-left).\n\nTransformers trained on vanilla Conjunctions (which are analogous to case (a)) are quite robust to distribution shifts based on our experiments. They behave in the same way even if we change the distribution over functions or inputs significantly and even work the same way with teaching sequences (though not as optimal as (b) and need more examples apart from teaching sequences like FFN+GD). For Transformers trained with teaching sequence, their behaviour is consistent with the second type of algorithm (b). They do work on OOD data as long as the inputs have teaching sequences in the beginning. The teaching sequences can be longer or shorter than seen during training and similarly, the target Conjunctions can have more or less literals than seen during training but they behave like algorithm (b). Like algorithm (b) they fail to perform well when the examples do not begin with a teaching sequence.\n\n\n\n**Revisions.** Also, we conducted some experiments and added discussions around the performance of FFN+GD with teaching sequences based on your previous comments.

The word âParityâ in the context of our paper and the works you cited [1, 2] have **different** meanings. In papers that you have cited âParityâ refers to a single function (a two-state automaton) over variable length strings which outputs 1 if the number of 1s in all bits is odd. In the context of our work, Parity refers to a class of functions over fixed-length inputs where the output depends on a *subset* of bits. These are categorically different problems. \n\nIt is untrue that â*various prior results [1, 2] have shown that parity is hard for Transformers to learn even in standard training*â. (a) For Parity tasks considered in our work (such as Parity-(10, 2), etc.), evidence from prior work [5] shows that they can learn that quite well and even better than LSTMs. Hence it is not obvious that they fail to learn them in in-context setting. (b) Additionally, for the Parity automaton problem, the results in [2] are in contradiction to your statement. They show that Transformers with reasonable depths (greater than 3 or 4) can generalize well in the in-distribution case (see Figure 3 a, b) in [2]). The limitations of Transformers on the Parity automaton problem are primarily concerned with generalizing to higher lengths which is unrelated to our problem.\n\n\n\nTakeaway 4 & 5 â*can be summarized as Transformers can meta-learn in-context; could you please elaborate how this contrasts with prior work such as Bai et al. 23?*â\n\nWe would like to emphasize that Takeaways 4 and 5 have **no relation** to the results in Bai et al [4]. The results in Bai et al [4] are with Transformers trained from scratch in the meta-learning-like setup and not LLMs pretrained on natural language data such as GPT-2, LLaMA or GPT-4. Recall that Takeaways 4 and 5 (Section 5) are with actual pretrained models and not Transformers trained from scratch. For Takeaway 5, there is no training involved with the LLMs. For experiments in Takeaway 4, the parameters of the Transformer model in GPT-2 are frozen. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, to our knowledge, our experiments with LLMs pretrained on natural language data among other things are the first to systematically explore the ability of LLMs to act as learning algorithms and solve learning problems in a manner similar to the artificial meta-learning-like setup.\n\n\n\nTakeaway 2: â*attention-free architecture can perform in-context learning: Xie et al. 21 already showed that LSTM has in-context learning abilities.*â\n\nWe believe there is a significant difference between showing that LSTMs can perform a particular in-context learning task [3] and conducting a systematic study with multiple architectures on a test bed with a variety of tasks showing that (a) several attention-free variants (linear recurrent, long conv, etc) can perform in-context learning for multiple tasks, (b) each of these architectures has certain limitations in comparison with Transformers. We observe different strengths and limitations of each architecture. \n\nThe takeaways from [3] and our work are different as well. Unlike the takeaway from [3], evidence from our work suggests that while attention may not be necessary and various attention-free models can solve multiple in-context learning tasks, they are not sufficient at the moment to match Transformersâ performance on all tasks considered in our work. \n\nOne oversight on our part is that while we have cited Xie et al [3], we have not cited this aspect appropriately and we will rectify it in the next version.\n\nIn our work, the experiments regarding takeaway 2 have a clear motivation: to systematically understand the performance of different types of attention-free models (state-space, long-convolution, recurrent) with respect to Transformers. Developing attention-free alternatives to Transformers is an active area of research at the moment. We argue that our results on a more systematic benchmark highlighting the limitations and effectiveness of different types of models could be informative to researchers working on developing more effective models.\n\n\n\n[1] On the Ability and Limitations of Transformers to Recognize Formal Languages.  \n[2] Transformers Learn Shortcuts to Automata.  \n[3] An Explanation of In-context Learning as Implicit Bayesian Inference.  \n[4] Transformers as Statisticians: Provable In-Context Learning with In-Context Algorithm Selection.  \n[5] Simplicity Bias in Transformers and their Ability to Learn Sparse Boolean Functions.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Further clarifications'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the detailed responses and the clarifications!

It would be good to include details of the number of parameters or compute used for each architecture so as to ensure that there is some normalizing factor among the architectures considered. This is to make sure that architectures like LSTMs and RetNets are not performing worse due to having a substantially smaller parameter count.*â\n\nFor all architectures apart from LSTMs, the parameter counts are almost the same since in architectures such as RetNet, Hyena, and DSS, only the attention layer is replaced with a different mechanism. The feedforward block has the same number of parameters which dominates the parameter count and the replacements for attention with Retention/LongConv also have projection matrices. LSTMs typically have a smaller parameter count because deeper LSTMs are more difficult to train and do not perform well. For instance in Figure 14 (right), you can see the generalization error of LSTMs get poorer for a larger number of layers.\n\nIn the next version (in a few days), we will specify the largest model (in terms of parameters) we trained for each architecture. We hope that suffices.\n\n\n\nâ**(Q2)** Reviewer: *It would be good to clarify in the Results section that the negative results only hold for the particular hyperparameter choices. In particular, these experiments don\'t rule out the possibility of substantially bigger models or models trained for much longer being able to perform better in certain cases.*â\n\nWe agree and this holds for negative results in any paper which is supported by empirical evidence. As authors, our goal has been to be as extensive as possible in terms of experiments and hyperparameter tuning. Nonetheless, the scenario you mentioned can always occur for such studies.  We will add a note in the paper mentioning this.\n\n\n\nâ**(Q3)** Reviewer: *In the abstract, it is mentioned that Transformers can learn gradient-based learning algorithms. The prior works that I know of either claim that Transformers can represent such algorithms or that their performance matches gradient-based algorithms - none of these imply that the trained Transformers actually encode gradient-based learning algorithms. This line should be rephrased to avoid confusion.*â\n\nWe think this is not entirely correct. While [Garg, et al.] showed that Transformers can match the performance of gradient-based algorithms and [ AkyÃ¼rek, et al.] showed that Transformers can represent such algorithms, later [Von Oswald, et al.] showed quite convincingly that Transformers learn to encode gradient-based algorithms. In particular, they provided a much simpler construction to show how Transformers can implement a gradient-based algorithm for linear regression and then they inspected the weight/parameters of a trained Transformer model and found that they encode the same mechanism as their construction (apart from some scaling corrections) (See for instance Figure 9 in their paper). In other words, their results seem quite convincing to support their main claim that Transformers can learn gradient-based learning algorithms.\n\n\n\nâ**(Q4)** Reviewer: *Here is a blog post that might be worth mentioning in the context of in-context learning abilities of real LLMs:* https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/c2RzFadrxkzyRAFXa/who-models-the-models-that-model-models-an-exploration-ofâ\n\nThank you for the suggestion.

Regarding your question about how Conjunctions are sampled, this is the description in the paper,\n\n> For tasks such as Conjunctions and Disjunctions which are either AND ($\\wedge$) or OR ($\\vee$) of some of the $2n$ literals, the function is sampled such that each literal $x_i$ or its complement $\\bar{x}_i$ has a probability of $p$ in being in the sampled function. In other words, for each $i \\in [n]$, the literal $x_i$ has $p/2$ probability of being sampled, the literal $\\bar{x}_i$ has $p/2$ probability and with $1-p$ probability the literal or it\'s complement is not included. In our main experiments, we set $p=30\\%$ and also investigate the robustness of the trained model when evaluated on other distributions (other values of $p$) in Appendix D.1.\n\nIn other words, the number of variables is not fixed. The conjunction can also have negative literals as well. We understand that it could be difficult to find this description in the appendix and hence we will add an explicit label to this in the next version of the paper.\n\n\n**(Q3)** *Is it possible for you to show what algorithm the TFs actually implement on some simple tasks like conjunction or disjunction?  â¦ These can be hard even an open problem, which is definitely not a requirement.*\n\n\nWe spent some time working on it earlier: Inspection of attention weights did not lead to any useful insights. We attempted to adopt the Transformer circuit framework [4] to get a more interpretable model. That approach requires training a simple 1- or 2-layer attention-only network (without any MLPs, layer norm, etc.) and we found that such simple models were unable to reach very high accuracy (unlike the vanilla Transformer) and hence it did not seem useful to try and interpret them. Further, we also tried training hard-attention (with very high softmax temperature so that the weights are almost 0 or 1) Transformers so that the weights can be more interpretable but such models did not perform as well and hence were not useful to interpret. Unfortunately, interpreting the exact mechanism behind Transformersâ computation for these learning problems seems like a separate problem and solving it could help solve multiple other problems. However, we believe that even without the interpretability aspects the insights in our paper could be useful to the largely active community working on understanding in-context learning phenomenon.\n\n\n\n**(Q4)** *For some tasks in your paper, there should be existing algorithms to learn it, such as conjunction or disjunction. I am also wondering how does trained TFs compare to them? â¦ Bayesian optimal estimators (or some strong, computationally efficient baseline on specific task, if any).*\n\nWe conducted such experiments and the results are present in the paper.  Figure 9 in the paper compares the trained Transformers with known PAC-learning algorithm for tasks such as Conjunction and Disjunctions. There are a few things to note here: (a) These classical algorithms are near-optimal and are guaranteed to work for any distributions over the input. They are optimal in the sense that the lower bound on the sample complexity of learning Conjunctions/Disjunctions is $O(n)$ and these PAC-learn these classes with $O(n)$ samples. (b) Transformers can perform better on the first few examples because they have knowledge about the distributions of inputs and functions since they are exposed to it in the meta-learning stage. So in that sense, they are closer to the Bayes-optimal-estimator than the classical algo in their behaviour. However, unlike the provable PAC-learning algorithms, the algorithms learned by Transformers are not guaranteed to work for arbitrary distributions. (c)  Both Transformers and the classical algo reach (near) perfect accuracy after observing almost the same number of $O(n)$ examples. \n\n\nRegarding the second part of the questions, we think the idea is interesting but we are not sure how feasible it would be to implement and compare with the Bayes optimal estimator within the discussion period. We will look into it as soon as we are done with the experiments requested by other reviewers which are relatively direct in terms of implementation. \n\n\n[1] Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning  \n[2] Trained Transformers Learn Linear Models In-Context  \n[3]  What can transformers learn in-context? a case study of simple function classes.  \n[4] ""A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits"", Transformer Circuits Thread, 2021.  \n[5] Masked Hard-Attention Transformers and Boolean RASP Recognize Exactly the Star-Free Languages'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Weakness and Questions'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for your thoughtful comments and time.\n\n\n\n**Response to weakness**\n\nâReviewer: *The author claimed that TFs can learn two distinct algorithms on tasks such as conjunctions, which is not that convincing to me.\nLet's take figure 3 as an example and let's call the four sub-figure a to d from the left to the right.

However, based on our interpretation, we think our argument in the paper is quite similar to what you suggest in the next paragraph.\n\nâReviewer: *At a high level, if you want to show the trained TFs can learn two distinct algorithms, it is not a good idea to show that they achieve different performance on different test examples but trained on same data distribution, It is better to show that they achieve different performance when trained on different data distribution, but tested on the same examples. â¦*â\n\nWe are not comparing Transformers trained on the same data distribution. We are comparing two Transformers trained on two different pretraining distributions (one with random examples and one with teaching sequences). Leaving aside Transformers, it is straightforward to see that there can be two types of algorithms: algo (a) is a more general purpose like FFN trained with gradient descent and algo (b) is a more specific algorithm which uses teaching sequences to find the correct conjunction. Now, the general purpose algo (a) will perform well with and without teaching sequences but it need not be optimal on examples with teaching sequences. On the other hand, the algo (b) will be optimal on examples with teaching sequences but can completely fail when such teaching sequences are not provided. \n\nWe claim that Transformers learn two distinct algorithms in this sense. This part is unrelated to Figures 3 c and d. If you look at Figure 3 a and Table 1 (or Figure 6) then these correspond to results with Transformers trained for Conjunctions in the vanilla setting (without teaching sequences) which work well with and without teaching sequences (analogous to aglo (a) described above). Figure 2 left and Figure 3 c (center-left) correspond to results with Transformers trained with teaching sequences (different pretraining distribution). Figure 2 left shows that they can perform optimally when teaching sequences are provided but fail otherwise (Figure 3 c) (analogous to algo (b)).  Figure 3 a and b are results with two different Transformers trained on two different input distributions (mentioned in the title above the figure). Figures 3 c and d serve a different purpose which depicts the result of a single Transformer trained on a mixture of distributions and tested on individual distributions.\n\n\n**Response to Individual Questions.**\n\n\n\n\n\n**(Q1)** *Your definition and narratives â¦  discuss more about your definition of ICL and how it relates to algorithm learning process.*\n\nYes, indeed our definition of in-context learning is similar to those of [1, 2] which are also based on Garg et al [3]. There are no significant differences in our framework compared to [1] and our perspective of looking at the meta-learning-like setup as algorithmic learning is almost identical. Their [1] definition is more formal which is necessary for their theoretical results and not required to understand the main findings of our paper. Some of our experiments exploring the sample complexity of Transformers (Section D.3 and Figure 13) are also along the same lines as their [1] work. \n\nWe are glad that you find the algorithmic learning perspective interesting. There are some theoretical insights about the representational capabilities of Transformers one can glean from such a perspective. Maybe you will find the following interesting: Recent works [5] have shown that hard-attention (hardmax instead of softmax) Transformers can represent functions in the class of AC0 circuits which are constant depth polynomial size Boolean circuits (with âandâ and âorâ gates). We found that we can represent the known PAC-learning algorithm for learning Conjunctions with a Boolean circuit in AC0 which implies that hard-attention Transformers are capable of representing the learning algorithm for Conjunctions (but does not imply that they can learn). If you find this interesting, we can discuss this in detail in our next version. Given space constraints we cannot include it in the main paper.""}}, {'title': {'value': ""Response to Questions (Cont'd)""}, 'comment': {'value': 'â**(Q3e)** Reviewer: *Relatedly, the point that ""FFN cannot learn from only the teaching sequences"" â¦.  insufficient to learn the task.*â\n\nThat is right and since FFNs+SGD are general-purpose learning algorithms it is very difficult to integrate such problem-specific knowledge so that they perform more optimally for a specific problem. \n\nThe claim here is not that Transformers are better general-purpose learning algorithms than FFNs+SGD. To us, it is interesting to observe that Transformers can learn near-optimal task-specific (vanilla vs teaching seqs) learning algorithms and depending on the input distribution during test (whether it contains a teaching seq or not), they can perform the algorithm that is more optimal for the particular input. So in some sense, where task-specific knowledge can be leveraged, they can perform more optimally than FFNs+SGD in some cases. This is true for other task-specific learning algorithms as well. For instance, Gaussian elimination is far more efficient for learning parities than with FFN+SGD but they are task-specific. While models such as Transformers can leverage problem-specific knowledge in some cases, it is clear that they fail on tasks such as learning sparse parities where FFNs+SGD can succeed in the learning problem. \n\nWe will add a footnote to that statement clarifying that the claim is not that Transformers are better general-purpose learning algorithms than FFNs+SGD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nâ**(Q3f)** Reviewer: *I\'m not sure it\'s fair to say that Transformers learn ""two distinct algorithms"" for learning with and without teaching sequences, since this seems to me as simply a matter of distribution shift: â¦*â\n\nWhen we test Transformers trained for vanilla Conjunctions on examples with teaching sequences, there is a distribution shift as well but they still perform well (almost in the same way as without the distribution shift). Ignoring Transformers for now, one can consider two types of algorithms for learning Conjunctions. Algo (a): a general purpose algo such as an FFN trained with gradient descent. Algo (b): The second algorithm is dependent on teaching sequences and uses the teaching sequence to identify the target conjunction.\n\nNote that the first algorithm can work with and without teaching sequences but it is natural to expect it to be suboptimal for inputs with teaching sequences. Similarly, the second algorithm will be optimal for inputs with a teaching sequence but will completely fail when the inputs do not have a teaching sequence. When we say that Transformers can learn two distinct algorithms, we mean it in this sense. From Figure 3 left and Table 1 (or Figure 6 top left), you can see that Transformers trained on vanilla Conjunctions behave like the first algorithm we described above. Similarly, from Figure 3 center-left and Figure 2 left, you can see that when trained with teaching sequences, they behave more like the second algorithm dependent on the teaching sequence. The emphasis here is on two different algorithms for the same class of functions (Conjunctions) where their effectiveness is dependent on the input distribution. If all aspects of the learning problem are identical then there is no reason to find two different algorithms. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nâ**(Q4a)** Reviewer: *Section 5: the paper says real-value functions are not straightforward to evaluate ""since LLMs receive and produce discrete values"": I\'m not sure how much this distinction is true or relevant, since LLMs do have embeddings which are vectors of real values.*â\n\nWe do not agree and the distinction is quite true. While training a Transformer of width (or d_model) $d$ on real-valued regression problems with $n$ dimensional inputs to learn functions of the form $f:  \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow  \\mathbb{R}$,  there is a trainable linear map $W:  \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow  \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ that transforms a real-valued vector to the same space as the width of the model. Pretrained LLMs do not have this linear map and even if we can provide real-valued vectors of the same dimension as the width (or d_model) of the model, it does not seem reasonable to draw conclusions from its performance since it has never been trained on those vectors. While training Transformers on Boolean functions in the meta-learning-like setup there is a similar linear map as well  $W:  \\{0, 1\\}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, however since the inputs are discrete and there are separate embeddings for the tokens â0â and â1â in the LLM, we can test the models by providing an n-dimensional Boolean input with n different tokens.

It was omitted since the plots were almost identical to Parity-(10, 2).\n\nâ**(Q2)** Reviewer: For OOD test results (Fig 10), how about the comparison to LSTM, especially under aggressive distribution shift where Transformers fail to preserve the in-distribution accuracy?â\n\nWe will try to do experiments along these lines and report back in a few days. \n\n\nâ**(Q3a)** Reviewer: *Fig 2: what's the value of k? To better show the progression of performance, could you please start the x-axis from 1?*â\n\nThe value of k is not fixed. It depends on the number of literals in the target Conjunctions or DNFs. For Figure 2 Left, the expected length of the teaching sequence in the Conjunction is ~27 based on the distribution of the class of functions. For function classes such as Conjunctions or DNFs, most of the examples in the teaching sequence have negative labels and hence any kind of baseline even Null accuracy can achieve near-perfect accuracy on the inputs in the teaching sequence or equivalently on the first 30 examples on average. However, the performances of the baselines drop right after the teaching sequence whereas Transformers stay at perfect accuracy on the rest of the examples. Hence, the performances on the first ~27 examples primarily containing teaching sequences are not informative of the modelsâ true effectiveness and were omitted to avoid confusion. Based on your comment, we will include the plot where the x-axis begins with 1 in the appendix along with the explanation of their performance in the next couple of days. \n\nâ**(Q3b)** Reviewer: I'm curious about the robustness of the teaching sequence results. For example, for different values of  (with dimension fixed to 20), does Transformer always able toâ\n\nFor classes such as Conjunctions and DNFs, the length of the teaching sequence varies so the performance of Transformers is not specific to teaching sequences of a particular length. For Parity-(20, 3), the length of the teaching sequence is fixed since the output always depends on a fixed number of variables in sparse Parities. If we change the length of the teaching sequence, then the class of functions will change as well and hence it becomes more of a problem about generalizing to unseen functions apart from generalizing to teaching sequences of different lengths.\n\nâ**(Q3c)** Reviewer: *For the teaching sequence experiments, I wonder what would happen if during test time, we permute the t teaching sequence samples, or permute all m samples.*â\n\nWe actually do permute the examples in the teaching sequences for the experiments with teaching sequences. \n\nWe have not explored the setting where all the examples in the prompt are permuted since it is not directly related to the motivating research questions of our work.

They even fail when provided with a number of examples which is sufficient for a feedforward network trained with gradient descent. \n\nWhile there are various classes of functions for which Transformers have been shown to perform well, we are not aware of works which indicate a precise class of functions (such as Parities) which are known to be efficiently learnable and Transformers fail to learn such classes of functions in-context. \n\n**(Takeaway 2)** Attention-free architectures can perform in-context learning as well (in the sense of implementing learning algorithms). However, there still exists a gap between their performance and Transformersâ performance. We are unaware of previous works that report such a comparison on in-context learning with such a benchmark of learning problems. Reviewer bf3N found both takeaways 1 and 2 interesting and noted that they can be of interest to the community.\n\n**(Takeaway 3)** Transformers can leverage more informative examples such as teaching sequences to learn more sample-efficiently when such prompts are provided and can switch to the vanilla version when teaching sequences are not provided. \nYour specific questions about takeaway 3 are discussed separately.\n\n**(Takeaway 4)** Pretrained models such as GPT-2 which are trained on natural language data encode mechanisms to achieve non-trivial performance on learning problems such as Conjunctions and can implement the nearest neighbour algorithm.\n\n**(Takeaway 5)** LLMs primarily pretrained on text data can take a sequence of inputs and labels in a manner similar to the meta-learning-like setup and perform as well as certain baselines such as the nearest neighbour algorithm. Evidence for 4 and 5 indicate that LLMs can learn from in-context examples alone apart from just indexing to tasks already seen during training. In other words, they can act as learning algorithms to some degree in a manner similar to the way we test models trained from scratch in the meta-learning-like setup.\n\nTo our knowledge, our experiments with LLMs (takeaways 4 and 5) are the first to explore the ability of LLMs to act as learning algorithms and solve learning problems.

In some scenarios, the distribution over functions or input could be different but we have not conducted experiments to check if models can generalize to higher lengths during evaluation.

Reviewer 9RLW found the experiments with teaching sequences particularly interesting. \n\n\n**Why new?** To our knowledge, prior works have not explored specialized input/training examples and have mostly focused on standard distributions.\n\nRegarding your comparison with Bai et al [2023]. There is a subtle difference but we agree there are similarities. In our related work, we have clearly stated, quote below,\n\n> âMore recently, [Ahuja, et al 2023, Bai et al 2023]  explored (among other things) the efficacy of Transformers in learning mixtures of tasks in-context and showed that they could adaptively select appropriate algorithms for a given sequence of inputs and labels.â\n\nPrior works have shown that Transformers can choose different algorithms for different classes of functions (say linear + logistic regression) depending on the sequence of inputs and labels. In our case, the emphasis is on choosing between different algorithms for the âsame class of functionsâ (e.g. Conjunctions). Unlike previous works, the target labelling function is still a Conjunction and the vanilla algorithm leads to near-perfect accuracy as well but Transformers are still able to choose the more sample-efficient algorithm which leads to near-perfect accuracy with fewer input examples.\n\n\n**(Insight 4)** Our results in Section 5 show that LLMs can learn new functions to some degree. All prior works on the meta-learning-like setup focus on Transformers trained from scratch and we believe it is imperative to understand if actual text-pretrained LLMs can learn to predict from such sequences of labelled examples as well. If they cannot, then it is unclear if any of the prior studies on the meta-learning-like setup have any implications on âIn-context learningâ. Our results provide new insights which demonstrate that LLMs such as LLaMA and GPT-4 can learn to predict as accurately as nearest neighbour baselines in various cases. \n\n**Why new?** Our results indicate that LLMsâ in-context learning ability goes beyond simply indexing from the set of tasks seen during training as suggested by some previous works  [Min, et al. 2022]. Prior works have argued that LLMs do not learn novel functions and simply recognize the function already seen during training when in-context learning tasks such as sentiment classification. Other works [Wies, et al. 2023] have developed theoretical frameworks for understanding LLMâs in-context learning ability based on such assumptions. Our results provide evidence against this and show that they can learn to predict unseen functions from in-context examples in certain cases. \n\n**(Insight 5)** GPT-2 can perform as well as baselines on learning Conjunctions and can implement the nearest neighbour algorithm in a setup which is very close to the meta-learning-like setup. It is important to note that GPT-2 is primarily pretrained on natural language data and not pretrained on any task that is close to this meta-learning-like setup but at the same time can achieve non-trivial accuracy on these tasks. Reviewer 9RLW found the experiments with LLMs interesting as well. \n\n**Why new?** To our knowledge, our results (insights 4 and 5) are the first evidence to indicate that LLMs can approximately learn new functions in a manner similar to the meta-learning-like setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Bai, et al.] ""Transformers as Statisticians: Provable In-Context Learning with In-Context Algorithm Selection."" arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.04637 (2023).\n\n[Ahuja, et al] ""In-Context Learning through the Bayesian Prism."" arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.04891 (2023).\n\n[Min, et al.] ""Rethinking the role of demonstrations: What makes in-context learning work?."" arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.12837 (2022).\n\n[Wies, et al.] ""The learnability of in-context learning.""

Transformers can leverage more informative examples such as teaching sequences.\n\n3. Attention-free architectures can perform such kind of in-context learning as well but they still lag behind on certain tasks. \n\n4. LLMs primarily pretrained on text data such as LLaMA-2 and GPT-4 can learn new functions in-context akin to baselines such as the nearest neighbour algorithm.\n\n5. There are mechanisms encoded in the weights of pre-trained models such as GPT-2 which enable it to perform as well as baselines on learning classes like Conjunctions and also implement the nearest neighbour algorithm in a setup which is very close to the meta-learning-like setup. \n\n\n\n\n**(Insight 1)** While prior works have demonstrated that Transformers can learn various classes of real-valued functions by implementing gradient descent or by acting as a Bayes optimal predictor, our finding provides evidence that there are classes of functions where they perform poorly and some classes such as Parities where they fail to perform beyond chance-level accuracy. This can be of interest to researchers in the community and it can be further explored by future work to understand why this happens (as noted by Reviewer bf3N). While it is natural to expect any model to have limitations, it is important to note that Parities are learnable in polynomial time with algorithms such as Gaussian elimination and for the problem of learning Parity-(10, 2) we provide the models with input points which are even sufficient for FFN+GD to solve the task. Hence, the problem itself is not unsolvable and it was to some degree surprising to us that Transformers as well as other models fail to solve this task. \n\n**Why new?** We are not aware of any other precisely defined function classes where Transformers fail and which are known to be PAC-learnable in polynomial time.\n\n**(Insight 2)** We show that various other architectures can match the performance of Transformers on various learning problems but there still exists a gap. Various architectures struggle on multiple tasks and Hyena is closest to Transformers in terms of performance falling behind only in the nearest neighbour problem. This could be of interest to the community (as noted by Reviewer bf3N) and could be useful for researchers working on developing new architectures that can match Transformersâ performance as LLMs. \n\n**Why new?** We are not aware of prior works that either compare the ability of recently proposed attention-free architectures to implement learning algorithms or works that even have a benchmark with a wide spectrum of performance for evaluating the ability of architectures to implement learning algorithms.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'The paper investigates the task of training models to learn various boolean function classes in-context. While the prior work in this theme has mainly focussed on the Transformer architectures and real-valued functions (e.g. linear functions), this paper studies the performance of various architectures (LSTM, Hyena, a state space model etc.) and mainly focuses on boolean functions. Some notable results include:\n\n1) On all function classes where Transformers can learn in-context, other architectures considered also work. However, the performance of other architectures can be worse. For instance, for the nearest neighbor function class, Transformers achieve 100% accuracy whereas other architectures achieve an accuracy of around 90% or less. The Hyena architecture particularly stands out and matches the performance of Transformers for all function classes considered except the nearest neighbors function class.\n\n2) No architecture is able to perform better than chance on the task of in-context learning parities and sparse parities. This happens even in the setting where a feedforward neural network (trained on the in-context examples using gradient descent) is able to learn perfectly.\n\n3) The paper also tests existing LLMs like Llama and GPT-4 (that are not trained explicitly for in-context learning) on in-context learning tasks in small dimensions which are guaranteed to not be in the training set, and shows that these models perform at par with a nearest-neighbors baseline.'}, 'soundness': {'value': '4 excellent'}, 'presentation': {'value': '4 excellent'}, 'contribution': {'value': '4 excellent'}, 'strengths': {'value': 'I enjoyed reading this paper.

This is the first interesting negative result that I know of in the in-context learning ability of these models (when explicitly trained for in-context learning), and deserves more investigation.\n\n2) The comparison between different architectures and their in-context learning performance on various function classes also seems interesting. Why do all architectures except Transformers struggle to some extent on Nearest Neighbors? Why do RetNets and state space models perform worse on 0-1 Threshold functions? Trying to find answers to such questions can shed light on the role of different architecture components.\n\nIn general, the paper is full of nicely executed experiments and many of them would be interesting to the community.'}, 'weaknesses': {'value': ""I don't see any major weakness.""}, 'questions': {'value': ""Some questions/suggestions:\n\n1) It seems all the architectures considered (except LSTMs) have the number of hidden layers and latent dimensions in the same range. It would be good to include details of the number of parameters or compute used for each architecture so as to ensure that there is some normalizing factor among the architectures considered. This is to make sure that architectures like LSTMs and RetNets are not performing worse due to having a substantially smaller parameter count.\n\n2) It would be good to clarify in the Results section that the negative results only hold for the particular hyperparameter choices. In particular, these experiments don't rule out the possibility of substantially bigger models or models trained for much longer being able to perform better in certain cases. \n\n3) In the abstract, it is mentioned that Transformers can learn gradient-based learning algorithms. The prior works that I know of either claim that Transformers can represent such algorithms or that their performance matches gradient-based algorithms - none of these imply that the trained Transformers actually encode gradient-based learning algorithms.

The way that authors compared these four figures and draw conclusions is that: they compare a and b, and the compare c with d, then they drew conclusion that the trained TFs can learn two distinct algorithms. This is not a good way for comparison. This is because one can easily give a counter-example to show that a single algorithm can simultaneously achieve a and b. For example, suppose the algorithm that TFs learn is: randomly pick one decision rule (or Boolean function) which is in the conjunction function class and agrees with all examples in the test context (the x_i, y_i pairs at test time). Then, when tested on teach conjunction (fig a), since there is only one conjunction function matching all test context, it will achieve a perfect accuracy. When tested with random sequence of examples from a conjunction task, there can be many functions in the conjunction function class that satisfying all test examples, so it can achieve a imperfect performance. Similar logic applies on the comparison between c and d.\n\nAt a high level, if you want to show the trained TFs can learn two distinct algorithms, it is not a good idea to show that they achieve different performance on different test examples but trained on same data distribution, It is better to show that they achieve different performance when trained on different data distribution, but tested on the same examples. In this case, you should compare figure b and c to draw your conclusion, instead of comparing a and b.

Your definition and narratives of in-context learning and the algorithm learning perspective (the last two paragraphs in 'in-context learning' paragraph in section 2) seems to follow closely with the formulation in [1] and the formal definition in [2]. Does your definition of in-context learning similar to their definitions? Or do you have any differences? IMO maybe you can discuss more about your definition of ICL and how it relates to algorithm learning process.\n\n2. I am not sure how you sampled the random conjunction function for each task. I think it is more important to say how you sample the random functions than how you sample the random inputs. Do you sample the random conjunction functions by sampling k variables for a fixed k and then form the conjunction function as the intersection of these k variables (f = 1 iff all these k variables are 1)?\n\n3. Is it possible for you to show what algorithm the TFs actually implement on some simple tasks like conjunction or disjunction? For this, you can either look into the attention weight of attention matrix (maybe train a single-layer TF?) or maybe you can try to provide some constructions that can provably learn these tasks? These can be hard even an open problem, which is definitely not a requirement.\n\n4. For some tasks in your paper, there should be existing algorithms to learn it, such as conjunction or disjunction. I am also wondering how does trained TFs compare to them? Also, some existing paper shows that the TFs can approximate or possibly learn (in-context) the Bayesian optimal estimator over some function class [1,2,3]. I suppose under the task distribution in your paper, it is very likely that the Bayesian optimal estimator is analytically intractible, but I think it should be numerically computable under some simple tasks. So I am wondering how does trained TFs compare to the Bayesian optimal estimators (or some strong, computationally efficient baseline on specific task, if any).\n\n[1].

In this work, we take a step towards answering these questions by demonstrating the following: (a) On a test-bed with a variety of Boolean function classes, we find that Transformers can nearly match the optimal learning algorithm for 'simpler' tasks, while their performance deteriorates on more 'complex' tasks. Additionally, we find that certain attention-free models perform (almost) identically to Transformers on a range of tasks.

For this, meshes are appealing since they enable 1) fast physics-based rendering with realistic material and lighting, 2) physical simulation, and 3) are memory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing and statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being topologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D representation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin, open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for reconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material and lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation that open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we parametrize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on watertight templates. With this parametrization, we further develop a grid-based and differentiable representation that parametrizes both watertight and non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications:  differentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and generative modelling of non-watertight meshes.

Mainly, since it employs a regular grid, surfaces with high and unbalanced entropy will require many grid elements, which can be inefficient and limiting for real applications.\n\nWe totally agree with the reviewer that grid-based representations can be inefficient for modeling many complex geometries. Nevertheless we would like to point out that, for many scenarios, it has been demonstrated that the grid-based representations can behave reasonably well (e.g. Fig. 13 and 14 in the Nvdiffrec paper [1]) with a single GPU.\n\n> Regarding the experiments in mesh generation, G-SHELL is compared against other implicit SDF based methods that can only represent watertight surfaces. Since the experiments are only conducted with a dataset of non-watertight surfaces (clothes), it is thus expected that G-SHELL is going to be better at the job than the rest of methods. How well MD w/ G-SHELL performs with watertight surfaces compared with MeshDiffusion? \n\nThank you for bringing up this point. To clarify: G-MeshDiffusion (âMD w/ G-Shellâ in the first edition) is a superset of MD. By setting mSDF values to +1, G-MD reduces to the original MD model. As a result, the performance of G-MD on watertight mesh generation is basically the same as that of MeshDiffusion.\n\n> PolyGen [40] is regarded on page 3 as ineffective for high vertex counts. Although this is probably accurate, it is worth clarifying in the paper that methods like PolyGen generate non-uniform meshes and use the vertices more efficiently than the regular grid used in G-SHELL. Comparing vertex counts between the two methods does not seem fair. \n\n\nThank you for pointing out this aspect. We significantly polished the related work section to avoid confusion.\n\nWe would like to further clarify some difficulties faced in PolyGen. First, it is relatively hard for autoregressive models to have a long (and varying-length) sequence, which is evidenced by the literature in transformers and language models. Besides, there is no guarantee on manifoldness (to be more precise, the guarantee on being âmanifolds with boundaryâ) and PolyGen easily creates very long non-manifold edges when the sequences in the dataset become more complex. In addition, even for the same shape, the mesh topology can vary a lot (different resolutions, different remeshing methods, etc.) and it is generally hard for an autoregressive model to handle such cases. For meshes that are manually created by designers for regular shapes like IKEA furniture, PolyGen may have an advantage over grid-based methods.\n\n\n> The paper lacks experiments on real data, especially in reconstruction. It would be interesting to compare G-SHELL + differentiable rasterizers against the baselines based on volume rendering or even vanilla NERF + marching cubes. Do the authors plan to include such experiments in the camera-ready version? \n\n\nFor generation, we would like to point out that there is a lack of real datasets for non-watertight meshes, mostly due to the difficulties in mass-reconstruction of 3D non-watertight meshes. Existing large datasets for non-watertight meshes are mostly for clothing / clothed humans (e.g. CLOTH3D [2], BEDLAM [3]) and all of them are synthetic. Even for these datasets, the diversity of clothing styles is limited. As our purpose is only to explore the representation, we do not explore building a better dataset for non-watertight meshes.\n\nFor reconstruction, we plan to include results of our method and baselines on real data. Due to time and resource constraints, for now we only show in the appendix the results of our method on data collected from a smartphone â with our method, the shape can be roughly reconstructed even under inconsistent lighting (due to occlusion during video shooting) and motion blur. In the meantime, we would like to emphasize that our method is primarily concerned with geometry - those volumetric-based methods typically face difficulties due to the flexibility of open surfaces (compared to closed ones).\n\n\n> It would be illustrative to visualize the watertight template being estimated jointly with the open surface in some of the experiments.\n\n\nThank you for your valuable suggestion. We have included the learned watertight template in the appendix of the revised draft. In the meantime we would like to emphasize that, for most of the experiments, no loss is computed on the discarded regions on the watertight template and therefore the shape of the watertight template can be arbitrary (though regularized to some degree by the Eikonal loss on SDF values).'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We appreciate the reviewer for acknowledging our contribution and raising their concerns.\n\n> While the experimental results are impressive, it is not clear whether the proposed modified marching cube or tetrahedra with mSDF value can guarantee the correct topology of the 3D mesh. For example, an isolated edge with no incident triangles.\n\nWe apologize for not explaining such an important aspect in detail.\n\nLet us first consider the case where we use a uniform and non-deformable grid to discretize the space. Indeed, a key benefit of using SDF is that no isolated edges will be produced as an SDF always produces manifold meshes. Similarly, mesh extraction with mSDF cuts a watertight mesh without breaking the (1-dimensional) manifoldness on 2-manifolds. The final mesh will therefore contain no isolated edges. Another way to understand the no-self-intersection property is to treat the âcuttingâ operation as an intersection between the watertight template and a âvirtual watertight volumeâ defined by the mSDF field (before being projected onto the watertight template).\n\nFor the deformable grid case: as long as we constrain the node offsets in the tetrahedral/cubic grid to some reasonable range (less than the half of the shortest edge in the initial grid will be sufficient), it is guaranteed that there will not be self-intersecting faces.\n\nThere are cases where one may want to use larger-scale offsets (for instance to capture finer geometric details without paying an additional price in GPU memory) or some techniques that break the manifoldness assumption (for example FlexiCubes [1]). In such cases, one can use standard Laplacian smoothing as a post-processing step, or introduce some mesh regularity loss (e.g. the mean angle deviation loss in [1]; related results in Fig. 12 in their main paper and Fig. 2 in their appendix).\n\n> The ability to handle specular surfaces is emphasized in the experimental results. However, the experimental setting to handle the specular surfaces is not clear enough. Do you simultaneously reconstruct lighting, geometry and material properties from the captured images? or you assume lighting condition is known.\n\nYes. We follow the Nvdiffrecmc paper [2] and simultaneously optimize geometry (SDF, mSDF, offsets), lighting and material.\n\n\n> How is the performance of the proposed method when reconstructing open surfaces that are homeomorphic to donuts or other complex surfaces with many topology handles?\n\nA: Good question! To demonstrate the capability of the proposed inverse rendering method, we have included an example in the appendix with a more complex pattern on the surface, where there are irregularly-shaped topological holes and isolated connected components. \n\nAnother example is the chair experiment shown in Sec 6.2. We have revised the visualization for the reconstructed chair (where the input views in the dataset only view the ground truth chair from the above), and it is probably now easier to see the topological feature of the reconstructed shape â the reconstructed chair legs are âwatertightâ similar to the handles of teapots.\n\n---\n\n[1] Flexible Isosurface Extraction for Gradient-Based Mesh Optimization.

We indeed tried to parameterize $\\nu$ with an MLP but eventually found that the hyperparameters can be hard to tune (resulting meshes often disappear at some point in the training process). Therefore, we parameterize $\\nu$âs explicitly on grids without an MLP.

(1) sounds like it really promotes hole-closing. In any case, it requires more explanation. What does the parameter `epsilon` do? How should one set it? The paper refers to ""topological holes"" but I assume what is meant here are boundaries, not handles.\n\n\nWe have rewritten the loss in the revised draft in a more mathematically sound and clearer way. The first term indeed encourages hole-opening. The second term, which is computed only on the boundary vertices (therefore of mSDF values 0), encourages hole-closing because we are moving the mSDF value from â$\\nu$ minus a positive $\\epsilon$â to âzeroâ. The epsilon behaves like the margin in a Hinge loss (except that we are using an $L_2$ instead of $L_1$ loss). We simply set it to an arbitrary moderately-positive scalar (not greater than 1 for numerical stability) and leave the control of the loss scale to the multiplier on the loss term.\n\nWe give an intuitive explanation for using the term âtopological holesâ with an example: without the hole-opening regularization loss, the holes at the lower ends of sleeves, in the T-shirt instance shown in the paper, can be completely closed due to initialization. Adding the regularization will encourage the mSDF values there to be negative. Once some values become negative, holes appear at originally closed regions. The boundaries of these holes now are free to contract or expand, depending on the image signal as well as the binary mask signal. \n\nWe have included additional qualitative results on the mSDF regularization in the appendix to demonstrate the effect of the two terms. A short summary of the results: 1) a large hole opening loss leads to optimization failures, while a tiny hole opening loss fails to create holes when initialization is bad, plus that the meshes in the never-observed regions fail to be removed; 2) a too small hole closing loss leads to incorrectly optimized shapes, while a too large hole closing loss may lead to artifacts on the boundary.\n\n> The appendix lists many more loss terms with free parameters, and it is unclear whether all of these terms are necessary. As usual, it would be helpful to add an ablation study. Some of the descriptions of the loss terms are cryptic and could do with elaboration.\n\nThank you for raising this important issue, and we totally agree with the reviewer that the amount of free hyperparameters is more than in some other tasks. We provide some qualitative results on extreme cases of mSDF regularization to validate the necessity of this specific loss, as it is not present in other related papers (to our knowledge). However, it would be computationally demanding to perform a full batch of ablation study on other hyperparameters.\n\n\nAll the other regularization losses (except for the Eikonal loss) are directly borrowed from the differentiable mesh renderer papers (Nvdiffrec [3], Nvdiffrecmc [4]) â- they are mostly specific to the renderers but not our representation. These papers prove that their regularization losses are necessary for learning the watertight meshes with âdifferentiable rasterization + Marching-Cubes-like methodsâ. As we parameterize non-watertight meshes as floating on learned watertight mesh templates, these regularization losses are helpful for excluding artifacts related to watertight mesh templates. Indeed, one of our objectives is to propose a unified representation for both watertight and non-watertight meshes. To cover the pure watertight cases, these regularization losses are necessary (since mSDF values are basically all positive on the watertight mesh template).\n\nWe apologize for not clearly explaining the regularization losses in detail, and we have added some more details in describing the losses in the revised draft to make our paper more readable. \n\nIf the current level of detail in the revised draft is not enough, we would like to refer interested readers to the original papers. Fully describing them will probably require several pages, especially given that we have included experiments with âG-Shell + FlexiCubesâ in which it is almost impossible to explain the mesh regularization without fully explaining their method.

If you are going to extend MeshDiffusion, it would be helpful to readers to include at least a little more explanation of what is going on in that figure and why (even if it has to go in an appendix or supplemental material).\n\nWe apologize for not clearly explaining the details. To further clarify the underlying logic, we have detailed in the revised draft the rationale behind the SDF normalization process in MeshDiffusion. For the ease of reviewing (especially for other reviewers), please let us repeat the idea below:\n\nThe naive diffusion loss means simply building a dataset with no restriction on SDF/mSDF values and using the standard L2 diffusion loss to train. The problem is that the learned SDF values are only values up to a scale (locally) of the ground truth ones â- for some regions the SDF scales can be huge while for some other regions the values can be tiny. As a hypothetical case: if we already know the SDF signs but not the scales, the uneven SDF scale across different regions leads to different sensitivity of interpolated (watertight) mesh vertex positions to the SDF values. The resulting model, with such an unprocessed dataset, will not perform well (similar phenomena have been observed in papers such as [1], where learning a good diffusion model with unprocessed datasets is extremely hard).\n\nBy predicting the linear interpolation coefficients, the effect of the imbalance in the scale of SDF values is removed (since the scale on the numerator and denominator of the marching tetrahedra formula cancel each other). The trade-off is mostly on the demand for memory â- one has to store and infer more information at a finer granularity.\n\nThe need for SDF normalization is mostly due to the parametrization with Marching Cubes/Tetrahedra, in which the SDF values are not obtained in a controllable way and the mesh vertex positions are computed as a nonlinear function of SDF values. At this point we are not aware of more efficient and effective mesh parameterization (e.g., alternative methods like Neural Dual Contouring [2] do not work as shown in Fig. 4 of [3]). \n\nFinally, our intuition is that, for any implicit function without a simple and robust enough mesh extraction rule (or a huge dataset + model capacity), it can be hard for diffusion models to generalize well on that representation unless we do some sort of âpre-processingâ â training a VAE for latent features as in [2], dataset normalization as in our paper and [1], etc.\n\n\n\n> The paper shows a lookup table for a marching-tetrahedra approach for G-shells. Is there also an extended version of marching-cubes?\n\nThank you for your suggestion, and we feel that an illustration for the cubic-case look-up table would be very helpful. However, drawing them is probably a bit demanding given the short period of time since there are dozens of  possible cases if we manually enumerate all of them even after removing all symmetry cases. We briefly explain how it is constructed. Take any case in the Marching-Cubes look-up table (Figure in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes). For any (planar) polygon, we can enumerate all possible ways to color the vertices (positive / negative) and therefore all possible ways to cut the polygon. For multiple (planar) polygons in the same cell, the numbers of cutting types for individual polygons are multiplied.'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""We thank the reviewer for acknowledging our contribution and raising the questions.\n\n> While the proposed method is faster than other methods as shown in Table 3, 3 hours is still too long.\n\nThank you for raising your concern. In this paper, we would like to focus on the representation itself but not the detailed downstream tasks (reconstruction, generation, etc.). We position our paper as a concept-level proof that G-Shell, as a new representation, has the potential to enable fast and robust modeling of non-watertight meshes â similar to the position of NeRF with respect to the improved methods in the following years. Acceleration of our method may be achieved by leveraging techniques such as hashgrid (as in InstantNGP [2] / Neuralangelo [3]) and tensor representation (as in TensoRF [4]), and it would definitely be an interesting avenue of future work.\n\n\n\n> The thin shape examples in Figure 4 and Figure 7 don't have complicated geometry.

Can the proposed method deal with this case?\n\n\nWe have included an example of a shape with a more complex surface in the appendix. For clothing with more wrinkles, as long as the resolution is high enough, the details can be well-represented.

As in G-Shell a non-watertight mesh is parameterized by cutting watertight meshes, the representation capability of modeling fine-level details is similar.\xa0\n\nAs self-contact breaks the manifold assumption, almost all methods using SDF to represent shapes are not able to handle such cases, and neither is G-Shell. Still, we would like to emphasize that even for simple open surfaces like plain T-shirts, the previous methods (mostly UDF-based) are very sensitive to noise in either the optimization process or datasets. Indeed, this is the major reason why the UDF-based methods fail to reconstruct meshes from realistically-rendered images (i.e., rendered with global illumination â the light rays can bounce between surfaces multiple times).\xa0\n\n---\n\n[1] NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis.

For this, meshes are appealing since they enable 1) fast physics-based rendering with realistic material and lighting, 2) physical simulation, and 3) are memory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing and statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being topologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D representation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin, open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for reconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material and lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation that open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we parametrize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on watertight templates. With this parametrization, we further develop a grid-based and differentiable representation that parametrizes both watertight and non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications:  differentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and generative modelling of non-watertight meshes.

"['Yang Song', 'Prafulla Dhariwal']",ICLR,Improved Techniques for Training Consistency Models,https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19754,2024," Consistency models are a nascent family of generative models that can sample high quality data in one step without the need for adversarial training. Current consistency models achieve optimal sample quality by distilling from pre-trained diffusion models and employing learned metrics such as LPIPS. However, distillation limits the quality of consistency models to that of the pre-trained diffusion model, and LPIPS causes undesirable bias in evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we present improved techniques for consistency training, where consistency models learn directly from data without distillation. We delve into the theory behind consistency training and identify a previously overlooked flaw, which we address by eliminating Exponential Moving Average from the teacher consistency model. To replace learned metrics like LPIPS, we adopt Pseudo-Huber losses from robust statistics. Additionally, we introduce a lognormal noise schedule for the consistency training objective, and propose to double total discretization steps every set number of training iterations. Combined with better hyperparameter tuning, these modifications enable consistency models to achieve FID scores of 2.51 and 3.25 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\times 64$ respectively in a single sampling step. These scores mark a 3.5$\times$ and 4$\times$ improvement compared to prior consistency training approaches. Through two-step sampling, we further reduce FID scores to 2.24 and 2.77 on these two datasets, surpassing those obtained via distillation in both one-step and two-step settings, while narrowing the gap between consistency models and other state-of-the-art generative models.",Oral 2C,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WNzy9bRDvG,https://openreview.net/forum?id=WNzy9bRDvG,WNzy9bRDvG,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'Consistency models (CMs) constitute a novel category of generative models that have demonstrated competitive performance in distilling pretrained diffusion models.

We address your questions or concerns below.\n\nQ1: Pseudo-Huber loss is not convincing compared to LPIPS\n\nA: We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. One major goal of this work is to eliminate LPIPS. Unlike LPIPS, Pseudo-Huber losses are not restricted to the image domain. Additionally, we have identified two other weaknesses of LPIPS in introduction: First, there could be potential bias in evaluation since the same ImageNet dataset trains both LPIPS and the Inception network in FID, which is the predominant metric for image quality. As analyzed in KynkÃ¤Ã¤nniemi et al. (2023), improvements of FIDs can come from accidental leakage of ImageNet features from LPIPS, causing inflated FID scores. Second, learned metrics require pre-training auxiliary networks for feature extraction. Training with these metrics requires backpropagating through extra neural networks, which increases the demand for compute.\n\nQ2: Apart from the significant change of removing EMA, the other enhancements resemble engineering optimizations rather than foundational advances. Their relevance to broader applications is questionable, especially since the empirical evaluation is limited to smaller datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64x64. Expanding experiments to include higher-resolution images on ImageNet or more varied datasets such as COCO or LAION could substantiate the model's versatility.\n\nA: We agree with the reviewer. This paper provides both foundational advances and engineering optimizations, not merely limited to the former. We plan to undertake large-scale consistency training on datasets such as COCO or LAION in future work.\n\nQ3: The training speed for the consistency model is comparatively slow, especially when compared with models like GANs.\n\nA: We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. Given the same model size, consistency training is faster than GANs. This is because GANs requires backpropagation through both the generator and discriminator, whereas consistency training only requires backpropagation through the student network.\n\nQ4: The applicability of consistency training appears confined to training unguided models.\n\nA: We leave generalization to guided models to future work.\n\nQ5: Does the current consistency training outperform consistency distillation when applying the enhancements presented in this paper to the latter?\n\nA: Yes. Consistency training surpasses consistency distillation, even when provided with the same enhancements.\n\nQ6: Given the apparent benefits of scaling up the network architecture for larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet as shown in Table 3), is there a risk that one(few)-step methods will be inherently limited by network capacity? In other words, can these methods directly approximate the ODE solution with a network of the same capacity as the original diffusion model, or would alternative approaches like RectFlow [1] provide a more viable solution?\n\nA: We anticipate that one-step models will be larger than multi-step ones. Consistency training can easily be generalized to rectified flows and may benefit from a similar reflow procedure.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for your thoughtful feedback. Please find our response to your questions below.\n\nQ1: Clarification on the theoretical analysis in Section 3.2.\n\nA: There are two competing theories justifying consistency training in previous work. As our analysis in Section 3.2 demonstrates, Argument (ii) is the correct one, requiring a zero EMA for the teacher network.\n\nWhile Equation (6) holds regardless of the relationship between $\\theta$ and $\\theta^-$ (as predicted by Argument (i)), it doesn't necessarily validate consistency training. This is because the training dynamics are defined by the gradient of the loss function due to the stop gradient operator in the consistency training objective, not the loss function itself. In fact, the gradient of Equation (6) is always zero, offering no training signal as $N\\to\\infty$.\n\nTo avoid degenerate gradients, the consistency training objective's gradient must be scaled by $1/\\Delta \\sigma$. This is demonstrated in Equation (7) and supported by Argument (ii). In this scenario, the gradient is finite only when $\\theta=\\theta^-$, which further validates Argument (ii) and justifies our decision to set the teacher EMA decay rate to zero.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that even if the consistency training objective doesn't exist, it's acceptable as long as its gradient is well-defined. Both conditions can occur simultaneously because the loss function includes the stop gradient operator.\n\nQ2: Do the authors have any insight as to why the Pseudo-Huber loss could bring this much improvement?\n\nA: As Figure 5(b) in Appendix B demonstrates, Pseudo-Huber loss leads to smaller variance in Adam updates, which leads to faster convergence in training. This is likely because Pseudo-Huber losses are less affected by outlier gradients in training data compared to l2.\n\nQ3: Do the authors have insights on why insensitive time embeddings are helpful or in this case crucial?\n\nA: As mentioned in Section 3.1, we believe it is essential that noise embeddings are sufficiently sensitive to minute differences to offer training signals, yet too much sensitivity can lead to training instability.\n\nQ4: How to feed noise level to positional embeddings.\n\nA: We followed EDM by feeding $0.25 \\log \\sigma$ to the positional embedding layer.\n\nQ5: No definitions of $s_0$ and $s_1$, and the typo in Section 3.2\n\nA: Thank you for the suggestions!

It may look like the loss function has nothing to do with learning the correct parameter $\\xi$ like the authors suggest in the second last paragraph in Sec.3.2. However, to me, this is not a surprise and totally expected. The self-consistency loss itself does not really force the network to learn anything correctly, i.e. the model could just predict a constant no matter the input and still be considered consistent with itself. In my understanding, it is really the boundary condition enforced through parameterizations that makes the model work, which is not a fact used in this toy example.\n3.

Current consistency models achieve optimal sample quality by distilling from pre-trained diffusion models and employing learned metrics such as LPIPS.

To tackle these challenges, we present improved techniques for consistency training, where consistency models learn directly from data without distillation. We delve into the theory behind consistency training and identify a previously overlooked flaw, which we address by eliminating Exponential Moving Average from the teacher consistency model. To replace learned metrics like LPIPS, we adopt Pseudo-Huber losses from robust statistics. Additionally, we introduce a lognormal noise schedule for the consistency training objective, and propose to double total discretization steps every set number of training iterations.

['Gautam Reddy Nallamala'],ICLR,The mechanistic basis of data dependence and abrupt learning in an in-context classification task,https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19749,2024," Transformer models exhibit in-context learning: the ability to accurately predict the response to a novel query based on illustrative examples in the input sequence, which contrasts with traditional in-weights learning of query-output relationships. What aspects of the training data distribution and architecture favor in-context vs in-weights learning? Recent work has shown that specific distributional properties inherent in language, such as burstiness, large dictionaries and skewed rank-frequency distributions, control the trade-off or simultaneous appearance of these two forms of learning. We first show that these results are recapitulated in a minimal attention-only network trained on a simplified dataset. In-context learning (ICL) is driven by the abrupt emergence of an induction head, which subsequently competes with in-weights learning. By identifying progress measures that precede in-context learning and targeted experiments, we construct a two-parameter model of an induction head which emulates the full data distributional dependencies displayed by the attention-based network. A phenomenological model of induction head formation traces its abrupt emergence to the sequential learning of three nested logits enabled by an intrinsic curriculum. We propose that the sharp transitions in attention-based networks arise due to a specific chain of multi-layer operations necessary to achieve ICL, which is implemented by nested nonlinearities sequentially learned during training.",Oral 2D,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=aN4Jf6Cx69,https://openreview.net/forum?id=aN4Jf6Cx69,aN4Jf6Cx69,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': ""All reviewers felt this was an extremely interesting and illuminating paper that explored and characterized in a hypothesis-driven way the emergence of in-context learning in transformers.

I consider this progression a plus.  The fact that the paper's minimal induction head transformer with two attention heads and one FF network replicates the Chan et al findings makes it clear that it can capture the mix of IW and ICL generally present in transformers, making it a useful reduced model to further understand. Zeroing in to understand more about ICL in an architecture that can capture both is important because IWL is the (or at least one of the) key new emergent properties that transformers provide, enabling few-shot learning, a crucial attribute previous models lacked.  Lots for further work will grow from this, including more work to understand such things as whether the analysis presented here still applies in the mixed IW/IC setting; it might still apply to the emergence of ICL, given that the IW learning probably takes place completely through the direct weights in the transformer FF layers, bypassing the attention heads which are especially relevant for ICL.

We have made the following changes to address your concerns:\n\n-- The three-parameter model of the induction head makes a prediction that training is not robust when L = N due to the saddle point in the loss landscape at initialization. We now verify this in the full model with new experiments by exploring various values of L and N (see Figure A.5). The key observation is that, when L = N, either the network never learns the ICL solution (N = 8) or only learns for a few seeds (N = 4 and N = 2). \n\nOur simplistic two-layer/one head per layer model is not robust and will not learn the in-context solution after applying knockouts of the type considered in the suggested reference. However, note that our analysis methodology of constructing a minimal model of an induction head is somewhat similar to a ""knockout"". That is, we eliminate all the irrelevant aspects of the model and consider only the parts that implement the relevant operation. The reduced model reproduces most (if not all) of the phenomena shown by the full model. Together with the successful prediction of the outcome for L = N, we believe that this is rather strong evidence that the minimal induction head models do indeed capture the core computations performed by the full model. \n\n-- We use p_C > 0 to ensure that the network robustly and quickly learns the ICL solution. This was simply so that we could run each experiment for a shorter period and run more experiments overall. We now clarify this in the text. Note that we focus on ICL dynamics and not the ICL vs IWL tradeoff in this section and subsequent ones. \n\nWe treat the quantification of the ICL vs IWL tradeoff separately from the analysis of the ICL learning dynamics. This is because a simple model can explain all of the ICL vs IWL results: the IC and IW solutions are essentially learned independently and at different rates that depend on the various hyperparameters. The tradeoff appears because there is a finite loss to explain. The relative rates of ICL and IWL determine the final IC and IW accuracies. The IC and IW accuracy curves do not show any evidence for a more complex interaction between IWL and ICL. We have modified the text to clarify this argument. We also adjust the strength of our claims to highlight that this is really a model that can explain the experimental data and not a conclusive proof. \n\n -- Thanks for the nice suggestion, we had not considered the regime of 0 < pB < 1, 0 < pC < 1. We performed new experiments in this parameter range (see Figure A.1 of the revised paper). Note that in this regime, the network has to learn both the IC solution and the IW solution to achieve zero loss. Interestingly, we find that the network can learn and maintain both solutions simultaneously.

ICL was enabled by the attention mechanism in transformer-based neural networks.  ICL is exemplified by the simple item-label association task (introduced by others) that the authors have selected for the focus of their analysis.  By shedding light on how this task is solved (building on an earlier paper taking initial steps in this direction) the current paper deepens our understanding of this core property of today's performant AI systems.\n\nThe authors have created new variants of the task that further simplify it, and have introduced minimally-sufficient transformer architecture containing two attention layers, which together implement what they call an 'induction head', arguably the core emergent computational structure enabling ICL.  They have provided a insightful analysis of the (ultimately simple, but nevertheless important) computations performed by the network that allow the effective use of information in context in their task.  They gone on to attempt to understand how this attention head computation emerges as the network learns to solve the item-label association task.  They identify progress measures in both the network's input-output performance and of its attention head computations and establish clear alignments of several of these measures.  I consider these measures and their alignments enlightening contributions and consider them to be strengths of the paper.\n\nThey go on to further support their analysis by developing a three-parameter reduction of the induction head, and show that the learning dynamics of this reduction is sufficient to reproduce many of the features of the learning dynamics of their complete neural network; they then use the reduction to test hypotheses about the relationships between the progress measures, showing that a further reduction that eliminates one of the progress measures makes learning success initialization dependent.  Finally, they make an even further reduction in the form of a 2- or 3- parameter 'phenomenological model' whose loss landscape can be fully characterized.  The parameters now directly reflect the efficacies of the two attention layers making up the induction head and of their mapping to the correct label, and allow the loss landscape of each of the variants to be visualized.  This phenomenological model provides an abstract characterization of the emergent learning dynamics of the 2- and 3 parameter reduction models that allows a full explanation of why these models learn reliably under the condition that the number of possible labels is greater than the number of item-label pairs in context, and fails to learn reliably when the number of possible labels is equal to the number of item-label pairs in context.  All the paper provides us with important clues toward understanding the computations performed by transformers and of the processes that give rise to their learning dynamics.  Along the way the paper provides an approach to analysis of neural network learning dynamics that others could adopt to understand the learning dynamics as they arise in other setting, another valuable contribution to the effort to understand the complex computations performed by neural networks.""}, 'weaknesses': {'value': ""Although I consider the analysis presented a tour de force, possessing all the strengths describe above, it is not perfectly clear that the analysis of the 2-3 parameter reduction would carry over to the full 2-attention-head network of Figure 1c.  A hunch I have is that the L=N case might not be quite as susceptible to failure in the full network because the full network might have a more complex loss landscape with a lower likelihood of being initialized in a place in that landscape that doesn't allow a complete solution.  An important and simple step toward addressing this would be to repeat the L = N simulation in the full network.  If the full network fails to learn in that case, it would confirm the applicability of the analysis to the full network.  Success would not fully invalidate the analysis, but would leave something left to explain.\n\nMore generally, I believe more consideration of what will happen in a larger model will be useful for the field.  Clearly things will not work just in the way they do in these reductions when the task is learned in a larger transformer.  While fuller characterization of that will be a task for future work, noting this issue as a limitation of the present effort and pointing considering how these results inform us about what is happening in LLMs will be valuable.\n\nThere are two less important weaknesses I'd like to see addressed. \n\nFirst, I don't feel I have an intuitive understanding of why the loss landscape of the 3 parameter model does not have a saddle point at the point were all three parameters are equal to 0.  Perhaps an understanding of this is latent in the equations and I could work it out with a bit of effort, but to help me (and possibly others) understand, it would be useful if the authors could work out such an intuitive understanding.  Such an understanding could help address reasons why the behaviors of the 2- and 3-parameter reduced models might or might not be applicable to the full model.\n\nSecond, paper is harder to read than it should be.  The main deficiency of the paper was its failure to take cognizance of the difficulty of extended chains of arbitrary associative bindings requiring long-distance leaps across context.  It is just such binding that lie at the heart of the mechanisms the authors are investigating, but they are hard for human readers when arbitrary as they often were in this paper. \n\nAs examples, we are treated to terms like the former vs the latter as referring expressions, arbitrary labels (a-d) for key phenomena, random ordering of the assignments of these labels to lines in graphs, arbitrary labels for hypotheses (I-V), and the unhelpful placement of figures (esp fig 4) on pages remote from the place in the paper where they are discussed.  Although ultimately the conclusions are stated in (what I find myself to be) conceptual terms, there should be engagement with this conceptual structure in the referential expressions used. I know space is limited, but I'm sure it is possible to do a better job. As examples, H3 could be abbreviated sCLA -> ILA+TILA (slow-learned context-label attention -> Item-label attention and Target-item-label association). Just let a,b,c,d and I-V go.

Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) often fall short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive success on research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs through $\textit{iterative hypothesis refinement}$, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive process than standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs a three-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that LMs are phenomenal $\textit{hypothesis proposers}$ (i.e., generating candidate rules), and when coupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able to systematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves strong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducing causal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However, they also behave as puzzling $\textit{inductive reasoners}$, showing notable performance gaps between rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule application (i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that LMs are proposing hypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules. Through empirical and human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies between the inductive reasoning processes of LMs and humans, shedding light on both the potentials and limitations of using LMs in inductive reasoning tasks.",Oral 3A,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=bNt7oajl2a,https://openreview.net/forum?id=bNt7oajl2a,bNt7oajl2a,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'The paper This investigates the inductive reasoning capabilities of large language models.

This is concurrent work, so there is no concern about novelty, but it would still be useful to have more discussion of the relationship.\n\nOur paper shares a similar spirit with Wang et al. (2023) in exploring the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs. However, we focus on understanding both the potentials and limitations of LMs. For this reason, our work differs from Wang et al. (2023) from several perspectives. \n\n- *Methodology-wise*, we explore various domains and different types of interpreters to validate the effectiveness of iterative hypothesis refinement. We minimized task-specific heuristics (e.g. we did not explicitly explain useful visual concepts like âobjectnessâ in MiniARC) and did not exhaustively tune hyper-parameters. We expect better performance by exploring alternative prompt templates and tuning hyper-parameters, as suggested by Wang et al. (2023).\n- *Analysis-wise*, we offer more exploration of the limitations of LMs and identify several counterintuitive behaviors of LMs in Section 4. We also conduct human studies (Appendix C) to contrast the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs with those of humans.\n\nWe discuss the relationship between our work and Wang et al. (2023) at the end of Section 1 and in the related work section. We also point out in Section 5 that some techniques used in Wang et al. (2023) could potentially further improve performance.\n\n>  I found the description of the approach somewhat confusing. Based on the abstract and intro, I was expecting that the hypotheses would be articulated in natural language, and this would somehow be translated into code which is then symbolically executed. It is explained later on (in section 2.2) that the LM also carries out this translation step for list functions and miniARC, but it would be good to provide some hint that this is the case earlier in the section describing the approach. My understanding is that for the other tasks, the LM is prompted so as to ensure hypotheses in a particular format, which can then be automatically parsed, is that correct? It would be helpful to clarify this (in section 2 it says that the hypotheses are 'constrained', but it's not immediately clear what that means).\n\nYes, for ACRE and MiniSCAN, the LM is prompted to generate hypotheses in a particular format. We clarified this in the introduction to emphasize that the hypothesis could be either free-form (in which case we use an LM to translate the hypothesis to a format interpretable by the symbolic interpreter) or constrained (in which case we can directly pass it to the interpreter). \n\nAdditionally, for List Functions and MiniARC, we also evaluate directly generating Python hypotheses (see Appendix B.2. Representation of Hypothesis). As shown in Table 9, using programming language hypotheses achieve comparable performance to natural language hypothese, suggesting that this representation can be a promising alternative for these tasks.\n\n>  I found this sentence, 'However, they also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance gaps in rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules)â¦' to be confusing, because it seems to say that LLMs are bad at proposing rules, even though it was just stated that they are good at this. This also seems misaligned with the results. It seems like this sentence should instead emphasize the rule application specifically (though, as mentioned above, it's not clear how significant this discrepancy really is).\n\nWe intend to highlight that there are significant performance gaps between rule induction (good) and rule application (poor). In other words, LMs are much more effective at generating meaningful hypotheses than at applying the rules they propose.

This should be clarified in the text.\n\nWe clarified hypothesis refinement results (emphasizing the raw accuracy of IO prompting is still better than hypothesis refinement on MiniARC) in Section 3. \n\nWe added two additional experiments.

Did the strength of the language model hypotheses correspond to performance on the task?

See Appendix C for details. For List Functions, where the LM achieves high accuracy, LM-induced rules and human-induced rules are comparably clear, but the former are sometimes less supportive. On MiniARC, where the LM performs poorly, we observe a significant performance gap between LM-induced rules and human-induced rules on both clarity and supportiveness. This seems to suggest that good performance is correlated with similarity with human-rules.

Also added explanation in Appendix A dataset details to emphasize that we only use textual representations of the original visual grids. \n\n>  Do the authors have any explanation for why the hypothesis refinement approach achieves worse performance on miniARC relative to the baselines? Given the visual nature of the task, it's not surprising that it doesn't help much, but I was surprised that it actually seems to impair performance.\n\nMany tasks in MiniARC can be solved through pattern matching. In such cases, learning a simple dictionary that maps colors between seen examples and unseen examples may be sufficient (see the bottom example in Table 11 in Appendix B.2). LMs have been shown to be good at pattern matching (Mirchandani et al., 2023). However, generating a rule involves a higher level of abstraction, which could be more challenging for LMs. Importantly, in our setup, the interpreter does not have access to seen examples. Therefore, the rule must contain sufficient and accurate information for the interpreter to achieve strong performance when applying the rule. We explained this in the updated version in Section 3.\n\nSuvir Mirchandani, Fei Xia, Pete Florence, Brian Ichter, Danny Driess, Montserrat Gonzalez Arenas, Kanishka Rao, Dorsa Sadigh, Andy Zeng. Large Language Models as General Pattern Machines. 2023.\n\n\n>  The familiarity analysis seems to confound two very different issues: 1) The presence of the same exact problems in the LLM pretraining data (a significant possibility, given the use of pre-existing datasets), and 2) the use of familiar vs. unfamiliar words (e.g. pseudowords). I think it's important to dissociate these concerns. This can be done by creating a new dataset with similar properties, e.g. by replacing the specific pseudowords and colors in miniSCAN (but maintaining the same general pseudoword -> color structure).\n\nWe share similar concerns. For MiniSCAN, we did not use any existing examples, but instead generated our own examples to mitigate the potential data contamination and uncontrolled lexical exposure issues (see Appendix A for dataset details). The âpseudoword â colorâ follows the same setup in Lake et al. (2019), but uses different re-generated pseudowords for inputs. The âpseudoword â pseudowordâ uses re-rengerated pseudowords for both input and output. We clarified this in the updated version.\n\nFor the âpseudoword â colorâ setup, it is still possible that the output has been seen during pre-training. To eliminate this factor, we experiment a new setup where we replace the color names used in Lake et al. (2019) to other common color names. For instance, the âdax â REDâ can become âdax â ORANGEâ. We evaluate 100 tasks and show results below. \n\n|                       Setup | Raw Acc. | Task Acc. |\n|-----------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| pseudoword â original color |     93.3 |      85.0 |\n|      pseudoword â new color |     97.1 |      95.0 |\n|     pseudoword â pseudoword |     86.6 |      71.0 |\n\nThe âpseudoword â original colorâ and âpseudoword â new colorâ setups both achieve higher accuracy compared to the âpseudoword â pseudowordâ setup.

Do any of these benchmarks contain human performance measures (e.g. I believe that there is already human behavioral data for miniSCAN in the original paper)?\n\nThanks for the suggestion! All of our experiments are largely motivated by cognitive scene literature. Therefore, they do have existing human performance as a reference. Note the exact setups, data, and evaluations in these studies might differ from ours. We include all existing human studies results in Appendix C.1 and refer it when discussing main results in Section 3.\n\n>  The results on noisy rule induction are especially difficult to interpret without a human baseline. The authors cite a paper indicating that humans are somewhat robust to noise when inducing rules, but the amount of noise and the specific tasks will matter a lot.\n\nWe conducted human study using the same setup and added results in Appendix C.3. We observe that both the LM and humans perform worse on tasks with noisy examples. However, the relative performance drop of the LM is more significant. We clarified this in Section 4.2 footnote 9. \n\n>  Throughout the paper, the authors appeal to intuition concerning putative human performance on the benchmarks they consider (e.g. in considering the potential for human reasoners to show a discrepancy between hypothesis generation and rule application), but intuition is not always a reliable guide regarding human performance. It would be good to qualify these statements a bit more (or, to the extent possible, to include a direct comparison with human performance).\n\nThanks for the feedback! We conducted more human studies to provide a more comprehensive head-to-head comparison between the LM and humans. The additional human experiments include asking crowdworkers to (1) write rules for 50 randomly sampled tasks from List Functions and MiniARC (as a comparison to Table 1), (2) write rules for perturbed tasks with a hint indicating that examples may be incorrect (comparable to the dashed line in Figure 4a), and (3) write rules for perturbed tasks without hints (comparable to the bar Figure 4a). We included all details of these human studies in Appendix C.3. While these studies do not cover all the experiments conducted with LMs due to cost constraints, we hope they provide a better understanding of the behaviors of LMs and humans and motivate future research in this area.\n\n>  The 'task accuracy' measure seems designed to emphasize the consistency of the symbolic rule application. When looking at raw accuracy, the differences between symbolic and LLM rule application don't look nearly as large. I think this somewhat undermines the claim that their rule application abilities are so much worse than their hypothesis generation abilities.\n\nWe consider âtask accuracyâ as an alternative metric as it captures a desirable property of an induction system: it should ideally consistently solve examples within a task. We use this metric to approximate the modelâs true understanding of a task because a model is less likely to solve all examples without using the expected computation. Although the differences in raw accuracy are not as large as those in task accuracy, they are still significant for certain tasks (e.g. relative performance drop is around 27% for MiniSCAN and around 42% for MiniARC). In addition, we observe that more advanced prompting techniques, such as self-consistency prompting and zero-shot CoT prompting, also do not bridge the gap (see Appendix B.2 for new experiments). As we argue in Section 4.1, we do not claim that we should expect LMs to behave as effectively as symbolic interpreters, but often the gaps are still large enough to support the argument.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer 6Upx (2/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': '>  How were the number of examples seen by the model chosen across domains? What is the minimum number of examples needed to learn a rule?\n\nWe leverage the existing datasets for our experiments, therefore the number of seen examples for each dataset is given, except for List Functions where we only use 8-shot examples. Our preliminary experiments on List Functions suggest that increasing the number of seen examples does not improve performance. Since our tasks are relatively self-defined, a small number of seen examples is generally sufficient. Finding the minimum number of examples necessary for induction is definitely an interesting and ongoing research direction! However, as we noted in footnote 11, this is out of the scope of this paper. \n\n>  An open source model would make the evaluations more comprehensive.\n\nWe included LLaMA2-70B results in Appendix B.1. \n\n>  A separate evaluation for LLMs as symbolic interpreters of rules would help tease apart the rule-proposing / application componenets more. More on complexity: LMs might be bad appliers of complex rules.\n\nWe include this analysis in Section 4.1. In Figure 3, we compare the accuracy when applying the rules using symbolic interpreters or the LM itself as the interpreter. We observe a consistent performance drop when using the LM interpreter instead of the symbolic interpreter. This suggests that while LMs are effective at proposing rules, they may not be able to apply their own proposed rules.\n\n>  Can LLMs apply rules induced by humans? \n\nThanks for the suggestion! Our focus is to evaluate inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs, therefore we did not evaluate whether LMs can apply rules induced by humans. Wang et al. (2023) show that human-written hypotheses achieve the strongest performance on ARC, suggesting that human-induced rules might be helpful. Note that their setup still only uses the LM to translate hypotheses and relies on an external interpreter to apply the rules. Itâs definitely super interesting to explore this direction, but since itâs beyond the scope of this paper, we leave it as a potential direction for future work.\n\nRuocheng Wang, Eric Zelikman, Gabriel Poesia, Yewen Pu, Nick Haber, Noah D. Goodman. Hypothesis Search: Inductive Reasoning with Language Models.\n\n>  Is there a change in the types of rules induced if the prompt is changed to encourage communication (since this was what humans seemed to do)? Change prompt to emphasize communication?\n\nFirst of all, to investigate whether other prompts would lead to different behaviors, we evaluate an alternative hypothesis generation prompt that includes task-specific heuristics (see Appendix B.2, Task-specific Heuristics). Specifically, we use MiniARC and add a detailed task description in the prompt (Table 10). This does help LMs to generate more human-readable rules (Table 11) for a fraction of examples, but these rules are still generally distinguishable from those induced by humans. Additionally, we did not observe performance improvement by imposing these constraints. While it is possible that other prompts could encourage LMs to communicate more, this would require additional prompt engineering and is beyond the scope of this paper. We mention this as a potential direction for future work.\n\nSecondly, for a fair comparison, we also did not instruct annotators to use any communication strategies nor did we provide any constraints or hints on the types of rules (see annotation interface in Figure 8). Humans appear to naturally use pragmatic communication strategies. Our point is that, without any specific instruction, LMs demonstrate inductive reasoning behaviors that are different from those of humans. Emphasizing communication could certainly be useful from a practical standpoint, but it is not our main focus in understanding the limitations of LMs in inductive reasoning.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer 6Upx (1/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for your valuable feedback and insightful suggestions!

Comparing the complexity of the hypothesis across tasks and domains might give some insight into the model performance.\n\nItâs definitely very interesting to analyze the relationship between the complexity of the rules and model performance. However, it is challenging to determine a good measure of complexity. As a preliminary experiment, we investigate how rule complexity affects model performance using List Functions, as its data was generated by programs. For each task, we collect its Python Lambda expression and analyze its complexity using abstract syntax tree (AST), similar to Bi et al. (2023). Note that the original List Function dataset uses a domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL defines symbols for basic list operations following a Lisp-like syntax. For instance, a list `[1, 2, 3]` is represented as `(cons 1 (cons 2 (singleton 3)))`. We did not consider this DSL for our analysis, as we hypothesize that Python is better represented in LMs' pre-training data than this DSL. Analyzing Python expressions, therefore, could provide a better estimate of rule complexity.\n\nWe consider both primitive and structural complexities and investigate their correlations with model performance. The former indicates the learnability of individual primitive operations, while the latter reflects the difficulty of the compositional structures of the rule, which we approximate using the number of nodes and tree depth of the AST. \n\nWe first examine how different primitive operations contribute to rule induction. We train a logistic regression model to predict LM's task accuracy on a new instance, using the counts of different types of nodes as features. The logistic regression models achieve an averaged test accuracy of 68.4% with a small number of features, suggesting that the model performance is somewhat predictable based on the primitives of the rule. We use the coefficient as an approximation of the learnability of the primitive operations.  These coefficients vary across different primitives, with some operations such as `In` being easier to learn than others like `Sub`. \n\nFor structure complexity, we measure the Spearman correlations between test accuracy and the structure complexity measurements. The number of nodes has a correlation of -0.31, and tree depth has a correlation of -0.37. Tasks with high accuracy generally have a relatively small number of nodes and tree depth. However, some programs with low structural complexity also have low accuracy, indicating that other factors, such as the aforementioned primitive complexity, should also be considered.\n\nZhen Bi, Ningyu Zhang, Yinuo Jiang, Shumin Deng, Guozhou Zheng, Huajun Chen. When Do Program-of-Thoughts Work for Reasoning?\n\n>  Similarly, the complexity of the human induced and LLM induced rules might be interesting to analyze.\n\nSince the human-induced and LM-induced rules are often in free-form natural language, it is even more challenging to measure their complexity. Measures such as minimum description length and the number of unique n-grams could be potential solutions. However, it is unclear whether these measures correlate with the complexity of rules in our setup. We agree that this is a very interesting direction, but it is beyond the scope of this paper. Therefore, we leave this as a direction for future work.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer bJW9'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your valuable feedback! We appreciate your support for our paper.\n\n\n### Response to weakness\n\n>  A few of the experiment setups feel a bit contrived - for example, randomly perturbing a set of items in a small set of experiments, of course, makes the task harder for a language model since it also requires it to infer that the noise is noise and not itself a deterministic part of the rule.\n\nTo better calibrate model performance, we conducted human study using the same setup and added results in Appendix C.3. We observe that both the LM and humans perform worse on tasks with noisy examples. However, the relative performance drop of the LM is more significant. We clarified this in Section 4.2 footnote 9.\n\n>  The section on familiarity of exemplars should also likely mention Dasgupta et al.\'s ""Language models show human-like content effects"" there.\n\nThanks for the pointer! We discussed this paper in Section 4.2 footnote 10. \n\n### Response to questions\n\n>   In practice, did you see this when refining hypotheses? It would be interesting to see how the number of revisions affects performance, similar to Table 2 in the concurrent ""Hypothesis Search"" paper from Wang et al. I see there is some version of this in this paper\'s Table 2, but given the emphasis that this paper places of hypothesis refinement, I\'d expect a bit more detail. Especially given the self-consistency, it would be valuable to understand the tradeoff between more attempts and more revisions.\n\nHuang et al. (2023) evaluates *intrinsic* self-correction without external feedback, which is similar to Self-Refine. As shown in Table 1, we similarly found an iterative approach without external feedback is insufficient. However, we did observe performance improvement over iterations for all datasets when coupled with external interpreters. The results are shown below. See Figure 5 in Appendix B.3 for a better visualization. This is consistent with the findings in Huang et al. (2023), as they discussed in Section 5 âLeveraging external feedback for correctionâ. \n\nRaw Accuracy \n| Iteration |    1 |    2 |    3 |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|\n| ACRE      | 79.8 | 82.3 | 82.5 |\n| MiniSCAN  | 86.6 | 92.9 | 93.3 |\n| List Fns  | 62.4 | 68.3 | 71.2 |\n| MiniARC   | 12.8 | 15.4 | 18.7 |\n\nTask Accuracy \n| Iteration |    1 |    2 |    3 |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|\n| ACRE      | 48.0 | 56.0 | 59.0 |\n| MiniSCAN  | 70.0 | 84.0 | 85.0 |\n| List Fns  | 52.4 | 58.4 | 61.2 |\n| MiniARC   |  9.2 | 12.3 | 14.6 |\n\nHowever, as we mentioned at the end of Section 4.3, qualitatively, in some cases, LMs tend to make minor modifications rather than starting from entirely new hypotheses. Therefore, in cases where the initial hypothesis is completely off, iterative refinement tends to be less effective.\n\nWe agree that it is certainly interesting to investigate the tradeoff between the number of hypotheses (N) and the maximum number of iterations (T). We did preliminary exploration (in Table 1) to demonstrate the correlations between model performance and these two hyperparameters. For tasks where LMs achieve strong performance, such as ACRE and MiniSCAN, a limited number of iterations is already effective. For tasks like MiniARC, where LMs perform poorly, the trends remain positive after the maximum number of iterations.\n\nNote that the maximum number of iterations is bounded by the context lengths of LMs. Empirically, we find it is infeasible to further increase T. An alternative could be tracking only the latest K iterations. Additionally, increasing N leads to more API calls, which can be computationally expensive. A summarization strategy, as suggested in Wang et al. (2023) might offer a solution. Therefore, identifying the best tradeoff between more attempts and more revisions could require more method-wise exploration, which is beyond the scope of this paper. We hope our experiments motivate future work along this direction.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer EAiR (2/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': '### Response to questions\n\n>  What are the prompts used to generate the Python program from rules for List Functions and MiniARC?\n\nWe use the following prompt template:\n\nâYou are an expert Python programmer. Write a Python function `fn` for the following rule. {Example description}\n\nRule: {Rule}â\n\nThe {Example description} describes the input and output types, e.g. a list of integers (List Functions) or a 2D grid of integers (for MiniARC). We show the hypothesis translation prompt in Table 14 in Appendix D.\n\n>  In Table 2, on MiniScan, T=3, N=1 yields higher raw accuracy and task accuracy than T=3, N=5, which means that fewer hypotheses considered lead to worse performance. Is there an explanation for this?\n\nOne possible explanation for these results could be the differences in sampling temperature. For N=1, we use greedy decoding (temperature = 0), and for N=5, the temperature is set to 0.7. An increased temperature might lead to more inaccurate hypotheses, similar to what is observed with SC prompting compared to IO prompting.\n\nMore importantly, the MiniSCAN dataset is designed to evaluate compositional generalization: certain unseen examples require the novel composition of known concepts. The distribution shift between seen examples and unseen examples means that high accuracy on seen examples does not necessarily translate to high accuracy on unseen examples. For instance, the rule âdax fep â RED RED REDâ is less preferable, even if it perfectly explains the given example. Since iterative refinement only uses accuracy over seen examples as the scoring function, it might overfit to seen examples and select hypotheses that are less generalizable. We clarified this in Section 3. \n\n>  In Section 2, the authors claim to evaluate models on âOODâ examples by generating longer or larger examples than those in the original datasets. This is a bit confusing. Are authors actually fixing the seen examples and only changing the unseen examples for testing?\n\nYes. We clarified this in the updated version.\n\n>  When asking LMs to write Python programs given the hypothesis, are the seen examples also provided in the prompt?\n\nNo, we do not provide examples.

It is hard to judge how big the performance drop of LMs is compared with humans.\n\nThanks for the feedback! We conducted human study using the same setup and added results in Appendix C.3. We observe that both the LM and humans perform worse on tasks with noisy examples. However, the relative performance drop of the LM is more significant. We have clarified this in Section 4.2 footnote 9.\n\n>  Experiments in 4.1 and 4.2 are conducted with simple prompting which may not be the most effective method to elicit this type of reasoning from the model.\n\nFor section 4.1, we consider two alternative prompting techniques for rule application: self-consistency prompting (SC) and zero-shot chain-of-thought (0-CoT). The results are shown below. We do not observe significant performance differences across these methods, except on ACRE, where 0-CoT underperforms other methods in task accuracy. We included detailed results and discussions in Appendix B.2 and clarified this in Section 4.1 Our results show the rule application performance is consistent across various prompting methods.

According to the appendix, example rules on List Fn and MiniARC are generated from LM with a prompt that contains no format instruction. It is unknown whether LMs can generate human-like inductions with more guidance or provided with human-induced rules as few-shot examples.\n\nWe did not introduce task-specific format instructions for List Functions and MiniARC, as they cover a wide range of concepts, making it challenging to determine the most optimal constraints. To investigate whether other prompts would lead to different behaviors, we evaluate an alternative hypothesis generation prompt that includes task-specific heuristics (see Appendix B.2, Task-specific Heuristics). Specifically, we use MiniARC and add a detailed task description in the prompt (Table 10). This does help LMs to generate more human-readable rules (Table 11) for a fraction of examples, but these rules are still generally distinguishable from those induced by humans. Additionally, we did not observe performance improvement by imposing these constraints. It is certainly possible that other guidance or few-shot examples could encourage LMs to generate human-like rules. However, the former requires more prompt engineering, and the latter requires additional human annotations, which are beyond the scope of this paper.

Do any of these benchmarks contain human performance measures (e.g. I believe that there is already human behavioral data for miniSCAN in the original paper)?\n- The results on noisy rule induction are especially difficult to interpret without a human baseline. The authors cite a paper indicating that humans are somewhat robust to noise when inducing rules, but the amount of noise and the specific tasks will matter a lot. \n- Throughout the paper, the authors appeal to intuition concerning putative human performance on the benchmarks they consider (e.g. in considering the potential for human reasoners to show a discrepancy between hypothesis generation and rule application), but intuition is not always a reliable guide regarding human performance. It would be good to qualify these statements a bit more (or, to the extent possible, to include a direct comparison with human performance).\n- The 'task accuracy' measure seems designed to emphasize the consistency of the symbolic rule application. When looking at raw accuracy, the differences between symbolic and LLM rule application don't look nearly as large. I think this somewhat undermines the claim that their rule application abilities are so much worse than their hypothesis generation abilities. \n- It should be emphasized more that miniARC, unlike the other tasks, is a distinctly visual task, in that it requires understanding visual concepts like 'objectness'. It is somewhat unsurprising that a text-only model would show special difficulty on such a task.\n- Do the authors have any explanation for why the hypothesis refinement approach achieves worse performance on miniARC relative to the baselines? Given the visual nature of the task, it's not surprising that it doesn't help much, but I was surprised that it actually seems to impair performance.\n- The familiarity analysis seems to confound two very different issues: 1) The presence of the same exact problems in the LLM pretraining data (a significant possibility, given the use of pre-existing datasets), and 2) the use of familiar vs. unfamiliar words (e.g. pseudowords). I think it's important to dissociate these concerns. This can be done by creating a new dataset with similar properties, e.g. by replacing the specific pseudowords and colors in miniSCAN (but maintaining the same general pseudoword -> color structure). \n- Is the interaction between iid vs. ood and IO vs. hypothesis refinement (figure 2) statistically significant? Also, the text describes the hypothesis refinement results as demonstrating superior robustness to this ood setting, but for miniARC the ood accuracy is actually higher for the IO baseline (even though the difference between iid and ood performance is larger for IO). This should be clarified in the text.\n- Were the language model and human hypotheses systematically compared in any way, or only qualitatively inspected? Did the strength of the language model hypotheses correspond to performance on the task?

This is concurrent work, so there is no concern about novelty, but it would still be useful to have more discussion of the relationship.\n- I found the description of the approach somewhat confusing. Based on the abstract and intro, I was expecting that the hypotheses would be articulated in natural language, and this would somehow be translated into code which is then symbolically executed. It is explained later on (in section 2.2) that the LM also carries out this translation step for list functions and miniARC, but it would be good to provide some hint that this is the case earlier in the section describing the approach. My understanding is that for the other tasks, the LM is prompted so as to ensure hypotheses in a particular format, which can then be automatically parsed, is that correct? It would be helpful to clarify this (in section 2 it says that the hypotheses are 'constrained', but it's not immediately clear what that means).\n- I found this sentence, 'However, they also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance gaps in rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules)â¦' to be confusing, because it seems to say that LLMs are bad at proposing rules, even though it was just stated that they are good at this. This also seems misaligned with the results. It seems like this sentence should instead emphasize the rule application specifically (though, as mentioned above, it's not clear how significant this discrepancy really is).\n- The authors might consider citing this related work on analogical reasoning (a special case of inductive reasoning) in LLMs: Webb, T., Holyoak, K.

In particular, we focus on improving GFlowNet with partial inference: training flow functions with the evaluation of the intermediate states or transitions. To this end, the recently developed forward-looking GFlowNet reparameterizes the flow functions based on evaluating the energy of intermediate states. However, such an evaluation of intermediate energies may (i) be too expensive or impossible to evaluate and (ii) even provide misleading training signals under large energy fluctuations along the sequence of actions. To resolve this issue, we propose learning energy decompositions for GFlowNets (LED-GFN). Our main idea is to (i) decompose the energy of an object into learnable potential functions defined on state transitions and (ii) reparameterize the flow functions using the potential functions. In particular, to produce informative local credits, we propose to regularize the potential to change smoothly over the sequence of actions. It is also noteworthy that training GFlowNet with our learned potential can preserve the optimal policy. We empirically verify the superiority of LED-GFN in five problems including the generation of unstructured and maximum independent sets, molecular graphs, and RNA sequences.",Oral 3B,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=P15CHILQlg,https://openreview.net/forum?id=P15CHILQlg,P15CHILQlg,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'This paper received a unanimous and strong positive reviews.

The corresponding information is provided in the last bullet in the last paragraph of **Section 4.5**.\n\nOne can see that GFN with uniformly redistributed energy fails in the set generation **Figure 10(a)** while showing good performance for molecular generation **Figure 10(b)**.\n\n---\n\n**Q3-Method-1.

So it does not make sense to use $T$ outside of an expression where $\\tau$ is a bound variable (like a summation over $\\tau$).\n- The analysis is interesting but not fully satisfying, since it just characterizes the optimal $\\phi$ as the solution of a linear system with complicated coefficients.

However, I find this analysis somewhat irrelevant. What the analysis says is *at convergence*, there could be positive correlation between the terminal energy and the learned potential. The important question, however, is what happens in the typical scenario when the loss doesn't go to 0. This is crucial since the trajectories that the energy decomposition is trained on is not IID, and thus there is no guarantee for convergence. Moreover, the connection to [1] isn't clear to me. To be clear, I think the empirical performance is great, but this analysis, in my opinion doesn't add much to the paper. It is possible that I am missing some details so I will be happy to reconsider my comment. \n\nW2: \nThanks for including this experiment! The method holds an advantage over a vanilla GFlowNet even with longer trajectories. But it is worth noting that the gap with FL-GFN vanishes in the longer tasks. This perhaps points to the possibility that learning the potential gets harder as trajectories get longer, which would make the improved credit assignment claims somewhat weaker. \n\nW3:\nThanks for sharing the computation time results. The results seem quite promising and presumably the advantage will grow with the length of the trajectories. However, I would like to note that the reward in the molecule generation experiments is still just a neural network which is still computationally cheap. \n\nQ1: \nI believe the experiments on the longer trajectories do show promising results but equally importantly they also point to a potential limitation w.r.t FL-GFN.""}}, {'comment': {'value': ""Dear reviewer qpM8,\n\nWe express our deep appreciation for your time and insightful comments.

Is LED-GFN also applicable for the tasks where the order of actions might matter?**\n\nYes, to the best of our knowledge, all the GFlowNet frameworks (including LED-GFN) are applicable to scenarios where the order of actions matters. To this end, one can define the state to incorporate the order of actions, e.g., a state $s_{t}$ information may include the feature $[(a_0,0),\\ldots,(a_{t-1},{t-1})]$ to ensure the order of actions-dependent GFlowNets.\n\n\n---\n\n**Q2-1-Method. Why do we want to smooth potentials? In this case, can we just simply set each potential to $\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{T}$?** \n\nAs mentioned in **Section 3.1**, we want to smooth potentials to prevent heavily relying on a specific transition, e.g., $\\mathcal{E}(s_T)=\\phi_{\\theta}(s_{T-1}\\rightarrow s_{T})$. However, we do not set $\\phi_{\\theta}(s \\rightarrow s') = \\mathcal{E}(s_T)/T$ for a specific trajectory, as the potential is associated with *multiple trajectories* $\\\\{\\tau |  (s\\rightarrow s') \\in \\tau\\\\}$. In other words, the potential $\\phi_{\\theta}(s \\rightarrow s')$ should be designed to consider:\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\mathcal{E}(s_{T})\\approx\\sum_{(s_{t}, s_{t+1}) \\in \\tau}\\phi_{\\theta}(s_{t}\\rightarrow s_{t+1})\\quad \\text{for all } \\tau=(s_{0},\\ldots,s_{T}) \\in \\\\{ \\tau | (s\\rightarrow s') \\in \\tau \\\\}.\n\\end{equation*}\nThen, one can observe that the condition $\\phi_{\\theta}(s \\rightarrow s') = \\mathcal{E}(s_T)/T$ for a specific trajectory would not be optimal for another trajectory. In **Figure 10** of our updated manuscript, we add such a baseline, i.e., set $\\phi_{\\theta}(s \\rightarrow s') = \\mathcal{E}(s_T)/T$ for a given trajectory at each step. One can see that our learning method still exhibits the most competitive performance.\n\n---\n\n**Q2-2-Method. When $\\mathcal{E}(s\\rightarrow s')=0$, FL-GFN reduces to the DB, but is it common case in many tasks?** \n\nYes, it can be a common case in real-world settings. Especially, when the energy evaluation of the intermediate state may be impossible, e.g., wet-lab evaluation for incomplete molecules, the change of energy would be evaluated as zero.\n\n---\n\n**Q3-Method. LED-GFN might learn $P_F(s_{t+1}|s_t)\\propto \\phi_{\\theta}(s_t\\rightarrow s_{t+1})$, but can LED-GFN sample $x$ with probability proportional to $\\exp{(-\\mathcal{E}(x))}$?** \n\nWe would like to clarify that LED-GFN learns a policy to be $P_F(s_{t+1}|s_t)\\propto {F}(s_t\\rightarrow s_{t+1})$ since our objective (Equation (4)) just reparameterizes the flow of the GFN with the potential: $\\log{F}(s_t)=\\log\\tilde{F}(s_t)-\\sum_{u=0}^{t-1}{\\phi_{\\theta}(s_{u}\\rightarrow s_{u+1})}$. Hence, LED-GFN can sample $x$ with probability proportional to $\\exp{(-\\mathcal{E}(x))}$.\n\n---\n\n**Q1-Experiment. In Figure 9(b), what is the number of calls, and why is the number of calls for LED-GFN the same as that for GFN?**\n\nThe number of calls is the number of energy evaluations. LED-GFN has the same number of calls as the GFN since the training of the potential function does not require additional energy evaluation, as it learns from the trajectories and energies that have already been evaluated during GFN training (mentioned in the last paragraph of **Section 3.2**).\n\n---\n\n**Q2-Experiment. Ablation studies on various dropout rates $1-\\gamma$ for Figure 9(a) are missing. How does the dropout rate affect performance?**\n\nTo address your comment, we incorporate experiments with dropout rates $10\\\\%$, $20\\\\%$, and $40\\\\%$ for the set generation and incorporate the results in **Figure 9(a)** of our updated manuscript. One can see that (1) applying dropout benefits credit assignment, (2) but too high a dropout rate may result in inefficient training.  \n\n---\n\n**Additional minor issues in writing.**\n\nThank you for pointing this out!

On alternative potential learning (Figure 10), why learning $\\phi(s\\rightarrow s')$ (ours) is better than learning an extension of $\\mathcal{E}$ to nonterminal states (simple model)?**\n\nWe first clarify that the 'simple model' in **Figure 10** uses a model trained to predict the terminal energy from the terminal state but not trained with the intermediate states. Here, we assume that learning $\\phi(s\\rightarrow s')$ has shown better results, as the 'simple model' may return not informative values for intermediate states that are not considered during training. \n\n---\n\n**Q1-2. On alternative potential learning (Figure 10), why do you need to learn a proxy model to predict terminal energies (simple model) instead of using the true energy function?**\n\nWe consider such a baseline since it can be a solution to address one of our motivations: true energy evaluation for intermediate states can be expensive (described in **Section 3.1**). Since this baseline can predict the intermediate state energy as a model-based approach, there is no need to evaluate the true energy for the intermediate state.\n\n---\n\n**Q1-3. Why do you not regress each $\\phi(s\\rightarrow s')$ to $\\frac{1}{T}\\mathcal{E}(s_T)$?**\n\nWe do not set $\\phi_{\\theta}(s \\rightarrow s') = \\mathcal{E}(s_T)/T$ for a specific trajectory since the potential is associated with *multiple trajectories* $\\\\{\\tau | (s\\rightarrow s') \\in \\tau\\\\}$. In other words, the potential $\\phi_{\\theta}(s \\rightarrow s')$ should be designed to consider:\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\mathcal{E}(s_{T})\\approx\\sum_{(s_{t}, s_{t+1}) \\in \\tau}\\phi_{\\theta}(s_{t}\\rightarrow s_{t+1})\\quad \\text{for all } \\tau=(s_{0},\\ldots,s_{T}) \\in \\\\{ \\tau | (s\\rightarrow s') \\in \\tau \\\\}.\n\\end{equation*}\nThen, one can observe that the condition $\\phi_{\\theta}(s \\rightarrow s') = \\mathcal{E}(s_T)/T$ for a specific trajectory would not be optimal for another trajectory. In **Figure 10** of our updated manuscript, we add such a baseline, i.e., set $\\phi_{\\theta}(s \\rightarrow s') = \\mathcal{E}(s_T)/T$ for a given trajectory at each step.

We follow your valuable suggestion by conducting experiments with modified TB that reparameterizes the logits of the policy with the potential. We incorporate corresponding results in **Appendix E.3** of our updated manuscript. One can see that our LED-GFN with your suggested approach improves the TB. We assume that the local credits support assigning a high probability to the action responsible for the low terminal energy.\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Pan et al., Better Training of GFlowNets with Local Credit and Incomplete Trajectories, ICML 2023""}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Dear reviewer RMo5,\n\nWe express our deep appreciation for your time and insightful comments.

Limitations/costs/failure modes of the proposed algorithm are not discussed.** \n\nWe incorporate your valuable comments in our new discussion section (**Appendix D**).\n\nAs limitations, our method requires additional time and space costs to learn a potential function $\\phi_{\\theta}$. However, the increment is minor for real-world problems with prohibitively expensive energy evaluation, such as the drug discovery task that requires evaluating with docking tools or wet-lab experiments.\n\nFor detailed costs, we report the additional time costs of LED-GFN by comparing with the GFlowNets. In **Appendix E.2** of our updated manuscript, we (1) provide time costs in molecular generation task, where the conventional subTB objective takes $5.80$ seconds for obtaining $100$ samples during training while our LED-GFN takes $6.61$ seconds, and (2) discuss the efficiency with respect to the time costs.\n\nAs failure modes, one can consider an extreme case where most actions are meaningless, i.e., they do not affect energies or the terminal state.

Why not test other baselines for energy decompositions?**\n\nWe do not conduct extensive comparisons between energy decomposition methods since (1) there are no prior studies about energy decomposition-based GFlowNets and (2) our main focus is first to show the effectiveness of energy decomposition in GFlowNets. \n\nNevertheless, to further address your comment, we add an additional energy decomposition baseline by modifying a reward redistribution method in reinforcement learning [1] to decompose the energy for GFlowNets. In **Figure 10** of our updated manuscript, one can see that our method still shows the most competitive performance. \n\nIf you provide information about an essential baseline, we would be happy to incorporate it!\n\n---\n\n**Q2. Why not consider the other objectives beyond DB-based and subTB-based objectives?** \n\nThe other conventional objective, i.e., TB, is not considered since TB is defined with the full trajectory but our goal is to enable partial inference for the local trajectory-based objectives, i.e., DB and subTB. However, it is worth noting that our new experiments in **Appendix E.3** show that our energy decomposition even improves the TB-based objectives.

There are no theoretical guarantees that the learned decomposition provides meaningful local credits in all settings.** \n\nIndeed, since our main focus is on improving the performance of GFlowNets in practice, our work lacks a theoretical guarantee. We provide our best efforts to alleviate your concerns in **Appendix F** of the updated manuscript and what follows. \n\nTo this end, we derive a fixed form condition for the potential functions that imply the meaningful-ness of our local credit via the correlation between potentials and the terminal energy (similar to [1]). To be specific, in **Appendix F**, we derive \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\phi_{\\theta}(s\\rightarrow s') = K_{1}\\sum_{\\tau \\ni (s\\rightarrow s')}\\mathcal{E}(s_{T}) + K_{2},\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere the summation over $\\tau$ is defined on trajectories that include $s\\rightarrow s'$ as its intermediate transition and $s_{T}$ is the terminal state of the associated trajectory $\\tau$. Furthermore, $K_{1} > 0$ and $K_{2}$ are constants with respect to the change in $\\phi_{\\theta}(s\\rightarrow s')$ and $\\mathcal{E}(s_{T})$. \n\nOur result hints at how the potential function is likely to be positively correlated with the terminal energies $\\mathcal{E}(s_{T})$ reachable after the transition $s\\rightarrow s'$. This implies how the potential function provides meaningful local credit, as maximizing the potential function likely leads to the maximization of the terminal energy.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**W2. There are no experiments on problems with long trajectories.** \n\nTo alleviate your concern, we conduct additional experiments with relatively long trajectories: the set generation with the size of $80$. We incorporate this experiment as an additional ablation study in **Appendix E.1** in our updated manuscript. Again, one can observe how LED-GFN significantly improves the GFN. \n\n\n---\n\n**W3. The experiments do not consider tasks requiring expensive energy functions, so the significant computational advantage of LED-GFN is unclear.** \n\nTo alleviate your concern, we provide additional experiments in **Appendix E.2** of the updated manuscript that demonstrates a significant computational advantage of LED-GFN even when using moderately expensive energy functions (oracle used in molecular generation). \n\nWe compare (1) the detailed time costs and (2) the performance with respect to the time costs with the considered baselines, i.e., GFN and FL-GFN, in molecular generation. Our method (1) requires approximately $14\\\\%$ of the additional time required for FL-GFN to enable partial inference in GFlowNets, and (2) shows the time-efficient performances compared to the considered baselines.\n\n---\n\n**W4. Why not consider a task to generate continuous data?** \n\nWe focus on discrete objects due to their importance in applications such as drug discovery and protein design. Nevertheless, our framework can be naturally extended to continuous GFlowNets based on detailed balance and sub-trajectory balance objectives. This would be an interesting direction for future research.\n\n\n---\n\n**Q1. Can you comment on the (1) scalability and (2) how much of the benefits LED-GFN provides for longer trajectories?**\n\nFirst, our LED-GFN introduces a small overhead compared to the GFlowNet training procedure, as it requires the evaluation of the potential function for each trajectory. In **Appendix E.2**, we provide the detailed time costs in molecular generation tasks. The conventional subTB objective takes $5.80$ seconds to obtain $100$ samples during training while our LED-GFN takes $6.61$ seconds.\n\nNext, longer trajectories require deciding a large number of actions, which is more likely to make the local credit assignment more challenging for GFlowNets. The benefits of our LED-GFN are more significant in these scenarios by providing informative local credits for partial inference in GFlowNets, as supported by our new experiment in **Appendix E.1**.\n\n\n---\n\n**Q2. Have you considered active learning with expensive energy evaluation and there is no intermediate energy signal?**\n\nIndeed, we did not conduct experiments with expensive energy evaluations, e.g., AutoDock. Nevertheless, we agree that the suggested experiments are interesting to highlight the benefits of our method: the efficiency with respect to the number of samples or energy evaluation. Unfortunately, we are unable to conduct such experiments during the rebuttal phase due to the expensive energy evaluation itself. We will consider this as a future work for evaluating our framework.\n\n\n---\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Arumugam et al., An Information-Theoretic Perspective on Credit Assignment in Reinforcement Learning, NeurIPS 2020 Workshop on Biological and Artificial Reinforcement Learning""}}, {'summary': {'value': 'The paper studies the problem of credit assignment in the context of GFlowNets.

Please do not hesitate to let us know if you have any further questions.\n\n **Q1**: How to quantify the ""sufficiently large"" inner batch size? Is there any principle we can obtain from the proposed theorem.\n > - We made this assumption of a sufficiently large batch size for inner step adaptation to (1) **guarantee the accurately estimated inner gradients** given the number of inner steps $K=1$ in Proposition 3, and thus (2) facilitate the proof in Appendix A.3.2.\n > - In practical applications where $K>1$, as discussed in Appendix A.2, the updating rule incorporates the average of inner gradients over all $K$ steps. This averaging mechanism **alternatively ensures the accuracy of inner gradient estimation, thereby alleviating the necessity for an excessively large batch size**.\n > - We validate the above analyses with two groups of experiments.\n >   - We compare the performance of (1) VR-MCL with $K=8$ and an inner batch size of 4 and (2) VR-MCL with $K=4$ and an inner batch size of 8.

As anticipated, a larger inner batch size indeed contributes to improved performance, while the improvement brought by increasing the inner batch size tends to plateau. This is attributed to the nature of the online setting, where all samples are seen only once.

Despite having an even longer training time than VR-MCL, La-MAML with 2 epochs only achieved a performance of 38.89%, which is extremely lower than the performance of VR-MCL (i.e., 56.48%).

Thus, $\\theta^*$ is task-dependent, signifying that **the introduction of a new $j$-th task corresponds to a new $\\theta^{*}$**.\n >   - $\\theta_{(K)}=U_K(\\theta;\\mathcal{T}^j)$ as defined in Eqn. (3) represents the parameter at the the $K$-th step optimized toward the current task $\\mathcal{T}^j$ in the inner loop.\n >   - The assumption that $\\theta_K$ resides in the $\\epsilon$-neighborhood of $\\theta^*$ is grounded on our **empirical observation**. Our experiments show that for each $j$-th task, the loss value of  $\\arg\\min_\\theta\\mathcal{L}^{[1:j]}(\\theta_{(K)})$ becomes small within an average of 5 outer loop steps, indicating a close proximity between $\\theta_{(K)}$ and $\\theta^*$. Further details regarding this empirical finding are provided in Appendix F.2. \n >   - We attribute this proximity as the recursive nature inherent in the above optimization process in the context of continual learning. Starting with $\\theta^{j-1}$, which minimizes $\\mathcal{L}^{[1:j-1]}(\\theta_{(K)}^{j-1})$ in the $(j-1)$-th task, $\\theta^K$ optimized for task $j$ swiftly approaches the local minimum of $\\mathcal{L}^{[1:j]}(\\theta_{(K)})$. This fast convergence can be elucidated by decomposing $\\mathcal{L}^{[1:j]}(\\theta_{(K)})$ into $\\mathcal{L}^{[1:j-1]}(\\theta_{(K)}) + \\mathcal{L}(\\theta_{(K)})$, where $\\mathcal{L}^{[1:j-1]}(\\theta_{(K)}^{j-1})$ has been optimized before.\n > - **The sufficiently large batch size in Proposition 3.**  \n >   - This assumption of a sufficiently large inner batch size **ensures that the inner gradients of the current task $\\mathcal{T}_j$ are highly accurate and stable**, given that Proposition 3 considers the number of inner steps $K$ as 1. Accurate inner gradients facilitate subsequent analyses (i.e.,$\\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}^{j}(\\theta_2)\\approx \\nabla_\\theta \\overline{\\mathcal{L}}^{j}(\\theta_{1}) \\approx \\nabla_\\theta \\mathcal{L}^{j}(\\theta_{1})$), as demonstrated in the proof in Appendix A.3.2.  \n >   - In practice, we adopt multiple inner steps, specifically $K=4$, aligning with the extended version of Proposition 3 (details provided in Appendix A.2). In this version, the prerequisite of Proposition 3, namely accurate inner gradients, is readily fulfilled by averaging over multiple steps. \n >   - We have further **explored the practical impact of the inner batch size** by evaluating alternative settings, specifically considering inner batch sizes of 6 and 10.

During sequential training, samples are sampled from $\\mathcal{M}$ and combined with those from the new task in a joint training process to mitigate forgetting. The proposed VR-MCL **aligns with established rehearsal-based CL methods** [1,2,3] by employing the **reservoir sampling strategy** to update the samples stored in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n> - This strategy updates $\\mathcal{M}$ to ensure that the stored examples are uniformly sampled from the tasks during online training. Under this updating scenario, \n>   - (1) when the online training tasks have an equal number of samples, the memory buffer $\\mathcal{M}$ will contain balanced samples from different tasks.  \n>   - (2) if the number of samples varies across tasks, the memory buffer $\\mathcal{M}$ will store imbalanced samples across different tasks [4]. \n>   - Since the majority of experiments in this paper adhere to the standard setting where all online tasks have an equal number of samples (setting (1) above), we stated that the memory buffer is updated to maintain balanced samples from different tasks. \n>  - Our contributions do not entail a novel update mechanism for the memory buffer. Instead, the proposed variance reduction exactly alleviates inaccurately estimated $\\mathbf{H}^j_M$, a potential outcome of imbalanced samples within $\\mathcal{M}$ in setting (2).\n>  - Thanks for pointing this out, and in response, we have revised the corresponding expression in Algorithm 1 (Appendix E) and provided additional explanations to eliminate any potential ambiguity.\n> \n> [1] Experience replay for continual learning.

To address the erroneous information during the Hessian estimation due to the sampling process from the random memory buffer, the authors proposed Variance Reduced Meta-CL (VR-MCL) to control the high variance of the hypergradient under online continual learning. With a theoretical analysis, the authors showed that the proposed VR-MCL is equivalent to the inclusion of a penalty term within the implicit Hessian estimation in Meta-CL.

And how did the authors set it during the practical training?\n2. The motivation for the evaluations under the imbalance CL setting was not clear to me. I did not get the relationship between the superior performance under this setting and the main objective of this paper. Or does the author just intend to show that the proposed method could still perform well under this challenging setting? Besides, it was disappointing to see that the authors did not provide further analyses about why the proposed method could address this challenging setting.\n3. In Proposition 2, the authors mentioned the assumption of $\\beta$. However, it was not contained in the final main conclusion.\n4. After Eqn.(4), $G_{\\theta_{b}}$ appeared without further explanations, which made the reader fail to have a straightforward comprehension of the meaning of $\\Delta_{b}$.\n5.

The main finding is that Meta-CL methods implicitly utilize the second-order Hessian information through the hypergradient obtained by bi-level optimization for meta-learning. From this new perspective, the author further points out the issue existing in the methodology of Meta-CL, i.e., the presence of erroneous information in the Hessian information due to insufficient memory data. To resolve the problem, the author correspondingly proposes a momentum-based Variance-Reduced Meta-CL (VR-MCL) method and provides extensive theoretical analysis to demonstrate how the proposed method can impose a penalty on the online estimated Hessian such that the model can be updated with caution to preserve crucial parameters.

This should be the first paper that formally and clearly dissects the relationship between seminal regularization-based methods and the methodology of meta-continual learning. The key message and insights are conveyed smoothly in the whole paper, and the author does a really good job of presenting them in a decent way.

Figures 1 and 2 are also compact and reduce the difficulties for the reader to understand the technical details of the iterative update process, which also highlights the difference made in this paper.\n\nAs the Hessian information is widely used not only in continual learning but also in many different areas of deep learning (e.g., meta-learning and flatness-aware optimization), the reviewer believes that the theoretical findings provided by this paper may not only motivate novel methods on Meta-CL but may also motivate novel methods for other areas in general.\n\n2. The unification of the Meta-CL and Regularization-based method is sound. Although there exist papers that try to unify different regularization-based CL methods in a unified framework, the CL methods they considered are mainly for CL in a fully-supervised setting, to the best of my knowledge, this paper should be the first one to connect the regularization-based CL methods with the methodology of Meta-CL, which may stand as a new research direction in the future.\n\n3. The reviewer also appreciates the understanding provided by the author in Section 4.2 after Proposition 3. It is refreshing to see that the variance-reduce method can ensure cautious updates such that the model can prevent excessive updates triggered by the wrongly estimated low-curvature direction of the Hessian, which may mitigate the partiality and erroneousness in the insufficient memory data, which should also be a desideratum about the kind of model update we should purse for. The insight may also motivate future work in continual learning and may also in areas like parameter-efficient finetuning.\n\n4.

While various studies exist claiming methodological advances on the one hand, and successful application on the other hand, the field is currently hampered by a gap between theory and practice leaving fundamental questions unanswered: Can data-related and model-related uncertainty really be separated in practice? Which components of an uncertainty method are essential for real-world performance? Which uncertainty method works well for which application? In this work, we link this research gap to a lack of systematic and comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty methods. Specifically, we identify three key pitfalls in current literature and present an evaluation framework that bridges the research gap by providing 1) a controlled environment for studying data ambiguities as well as distribution shifts, 2) systematic ablations of relevant method components, and 3) test-beds for the five predominant uncertainty applications: OoD-detection, active learning, failure detection, calibration, and ambiguity modeling. Empirical results on simulated as well as real-world data demonstrate how the proposed framework is able to answer the predominant questions in the field revealing for instance that 1) separation of uncertainty types works on simulated data but does not necessarily translate to real-world data, 2) aggregation of scores is a crucial but currently neglected component of uncertainty methods, 3) While ensembles are performing most robustly across the different downstream tasks and settings, test-time augmentation often constitutes a light-weight alternative.

Is there any recommended guidelines [...], or, should users try all combinations?\n- While we have some working hypothesis on the pros and cons of applied aggregation strategies, there is no clear signal in our empirical results, thus, given testing the limited number of potential strategies is a cheap post-hoc analysis, our recommendation for reliable performance is empirical testing.\n- One advice for AL tasks could be to test the performance of aggregation strategies on proxy tasks before relying on a single strategy throughout the expensive AL training cycle.\n- We did identify one âred flagâ: using sum-aggregation when there is a potential correlation with the object size in the image. Thus, another recommendation is to reflect on such correlations when choosing an aggregation strategy.\n- In response to your feedback, and to communicate these recommendations more prominently, we added a paragraph in Sec. 4.5.\n\n---\nQ1. It seems the authors have considered sampling-based methods [...]. How would the discussion be if the method is sampling-free like [2]?\n- Since the method in [2] is proposed as an alternative to Monte Carlo-Dropout (MCD), and it is further compared to MCD showing similar behavior, we would assume that the behavior in our setting would be similar as well.\n- Evidence for this hypothesis is also given in [2 Fig.5], where the structural similarity of the uncertainty maps between Bayesian SegNet and their sampling-free method is shown.\n- It might also be interesting to discuss the performance of the uncertainty method in conjunction with the computational overhead, similarly to the cost-benefit tradeoff between ensembles and TTA discussed in our manuscript.\n\n---\nQ2. As the authors have considered SSNs, would the discussion for probabilistic (Prob.) methods like Prob. UNet [3] be similar or different?\n- Both methods use random variables to model the spatially coherent distribution of outcomes given a sample (while the SSN does so by assuming a multivariate Gaussian over the distribution of logits, the Prob. U-Net utilizes a latent variable model during the forward pass). Therefore their behavior is expected to be similar.\n- However, SSNs are a more lightweight alternative to the Prob. U-Net (no separate network to estimate the distribution, no variational inference training), rendering SSNs more applicable for users, which is why we preferred this method in our benchmark. \n- In the SSN paper, the authors claim to outperform the Prob. U-Net in terms of GED. However, in theory, the Prob. U-Net is more expressive in its abilities to model ambiguity. This can be seen in [f Tab. 2] when both models are conditioned on modeling a specific style.\n\n[f] Zepf et al. âThat Label\'s Got Style: Handling Label Style Bias for Uncertain Image Segmentationâ\n\n---\nThank you once more for your constructive feedback.

In this work, we link this research gap to a lack of systematic and comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty methods.

Empirical results on simulated as well as real-world data demonstrate how the proposed framework is able to answer the predominant questions in the field revealing for instance that 1) separation of uncertainty types works on simulated data but does not necessarily translate to real-world data, 2) aggregation of scores is a crucial but currently neglected component of uncertainty methods, 3) While ensembles are performing most robustly across the different downstream tasks and settings, test-time augmentation often constitutes a light-weight alternative.

"['Yeming Wen', 'Swarat Chaudhuri']",ICLR,Batched Low-Rank Adaptation of Foundation Models,https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19716,2024," Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently gained attention for fine-tuning foundation models by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. While \lora/ offers numerous advantages, its applicability for real-time serving to a diverse and global user base is constrained by its incapability to handle multiple task-specific adapters efficiently. This imposes a performance bottleneck in scenarios requiring personalized, task-specific adaptations for each incoming request.To address this, we introduce FLoRA (Fast LoRA), a framework in which each input example in a minibatch can be associated with its unique low-rank adaptation weights, allowing for efficient batching of heterogeneous requests. We empirically demonstrate that \flora/ retains the performance merits of \lora/, showcasing competitive results on the MultiPL-E code generation benchmark spanning over 8 languages and a multilingual speech recognition task across 6 languages.",Oral 4A,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=w4abltTZ2f,https://openreview.net/forum?id=w4abltTZ2f,w4abltTZ2f,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'The paper improves on the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) framework to fine-tune foundation models by introducing FLoRA (""Fast LoRA""), which allows distinct adapters (with different rank) for different task-specific requirements within the same batch.

Each language does have a different number of hours of fine-tuning data. For Marathi, we observed instability in the training loss of fLoRA, which may have contributed to its relative underperformance.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your insightful review and the opportunity to address your concerns.\n\n> The ""performance bottleneck in scenarios requiring personalized, task-specific adaptations for each incoming request"" isn\'t largely solved.\n\nThe primary performance bottleneck we aim to address with fLoRA is computational efficiency, particularly in serving scenarios requiring fast response times. For example, as shown in Fig. 2b, waiting 2.2 sec per output token is impractical in real-world applications. fLoRA provided an alternative solution in such scenarios, improving throughput and reducing latency without compromising accuracy. We will clarify this in our revised manuscript to emphasize that the bottleneck addressed is in computational performance.\n\n> The whole mechanism and the algorithm isn\'t mentioned clearly. e.g., how to choose the batch size for real situations, how to make each example corresponding to its appropriate adapters during inference. \n\nThank you for pointing this out. We will make sure to include more algorithmic details in the revision. For the experiment in Sec 4.1, the vLLM framework does not use batch size. Instead, it uses max number batched tokens to control how many tokens can be batched in one forward pass. For the throughput experiment, we set max_num_batched_tokens to be 8192, following the convention of using higher batch size for throughput benchmarking. Assuming the average input length of the testing dataset (the chat dataset to fine-tune the Vicuna model) is 512 then the batch size would be 16. For the latency experiment, we set max_num_batched_tokens to be 2560 which is the default setting of the vLLM framework for online serving.  \n\nWe assume the simplest case in the serving experiment where all possible adapters have been loaded in the memory. We also assume that each example (each request) in the batch is associated with an adapter id, then the adapter can be chosen by calling torch indexing.\n\n> Memory consumption.\n\nIn the serving scenario, we did not observe any memory difference between fLoRA and LoRA. The vLLM framework will fit as many tokens as possible (but less than max_num_batched_tokens), utilizing all GPU memory. In the fine-tuning stage, when the rank is small, the memory consumption of fLoRA is roughly the same as LoRA. However, when the rank gets bigger (say rank > 7), the memory consumption of fLoRA is larger than LoRA. Notice that the self-attention layer accounts for the major memory consumption which fLoRA and LoRA don\'t touch. We will clarify this in the revision.\n\n\n> What is âsame expressive powerâ\n\nWe use ""expressive power"" to denote the rank of the modulation matrix. Both fLoRA and LoRA have the capability to modulate the weight matrix up to any desired rank. In this perspective, they have the same expressive power. We will make this clearer in the revision.\n\n> Rationale for Multiplication in fLoRA\n\nThe transition from addition to multiplication is primarily driven by computational efficiency. The multiplication operator enables the batching mechanism.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your insightful review.\n> Could you explicitly clarify the definition of âexpressive powerâ in the paper?\n\nWe use ""expressive power"" to denote the rank of the modulation matrix. Both fLoRA and LoRA have the capability to modulate the weight matrix up to any desired rank. In this perspective, they have the same expressive power. We will make this clearer in the revision.\n\n> Expect a higher, rather than simply equivalent, accuracy compared to LoRA?\n\nIn our experiments (Sec. 4.2 and Sec. 4.3), we also trained task specific LoRA heads for each language in order for a fair comparison. Hence, one wouldnât expect fLoRA outperform LoRA in terms of accuracy on the tasks we considered. In practice, the **average task accuracy** of fLoRA might be higher LoRA assuming LoRA has to use the same adapter in a majority of samples. However, our experiments did not account for this scenario so we did not claim a higher accuracy from fLoRA.\n\n> In fLoRA the weight matrix specific for each example is the element-wise MULTIPLICATION of W0 and DeltaWi?\n\nThis is correct.\n\n> Scenarios when Eq 7 is less than 1.\n\nEquation 7 will not hold true when the rank (r) is large. This is supported by the data shown in Figure 2, where LoRA\'s performance begins to exceed that of fLoRA as the rank increases beyond a certain threshold. We will elaborate on this in the revised version.\n\nWe also appreciate the feedback on how to improve the paperâs readability such as removing references from the abstract and better framing in Fig 1. We will make these adjustments in the revision.'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for your thorough review and constructive feedback. We appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.\n\n> Why is the batch size not appearing in Eq 7?\n\nThis is because for presentation purposes we assume c1 and c2 are constants and c1 >> c2. But in the actual PyTorch implementation, c1/c2 is a function of batch size (c1 = c2 when batch size is 1 and c1>>c2 when batch size is large). Notice that in the linear layer during LLM serving, the effective batch size is # sequences * max_sequence_length so it is safe to assume c1 >> c2. We will clarify this aspect in the revision.\n\n> Throughput and latency under per token case.\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion that analyzing the throughput and latency under such an extreme case will offer more insights. We agree that this analysis will provide a more comprehensive study of fLoRA's serving capabilities. This scenario is expected to demonstrate even more advantages for fLoRA over BMM LoRA. This requires a new implementation under our current modification over the vLLM framework. We will include this study in the revision. We will also consider the per batch adapter case as mentioned in your questions.\n\n> Limited applicability \n\nThank you for pointing out the limited applicability due to the low-rank setup. We agree that some applicable scenarios can be taken care of by the base LLM pretraining. While it's true that certain scenarios could be addressed during base LLM pretraining, we want to point out that our approach is particularly beneficial for tailoring responses to specific user requests that may involve tail knowledge such as a personal codebase or personal browning history, which is usually not covered in pre-training. \n\n> Batch size\n\nThank you for pointing out the impact of batch size. In the vLLM framework, it uses max number batched tokens to control how many tokens can be batched in one forward pass. For the throughput experiment, we set max_num_batched_tokens to be 8192, following the convention of using the model context size (Starcoder). Assuming the average input length of the testing dataset (the chat dataset to fine-tune the Vicuna model) is 512 then the batch size would be 16. For the latency experiment, we set max_num_batched_tokens to be 2560 which is the default setting of the vLLM framework for online serving.  \n\nFurthermore, according to https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/master/blogs/deepspeed-fastgen/README.md, section 3, the number of batched tokens is a better signal than batch size when measuring the performance in the serving scenario. The convention to measure throughput is to increase the number of batched tokens to reach the throughput-saturating regime. \n\nWe ran additional experiments with max_num_batched_tokens=4096 and max_num_batched_tokens=2048. The throughput of both fLoRA and LoRA reduced roughly 10% and 20% compared to max_num_batched_tokens=8192. This is because it is not in the throughput-saturating regime of the H100 GPU. The critical rank remains the same. \n\nWe will include this study in the revision.\n\n> Confusing section 3.1\n\nWe appreciate your feedback on the clarity of Section 3.1.

We address them below.\n\n> How fast is the training of the proposed approach compared to the training of previous diffusion models? As RSGM (Riemannian Score-based Generative Model) observes that they achieve similar test NLL with only 5 in-training simulation steps (Section O.1), I think that the simulation-free training does not provide significant time efficiency.\n\nNote that in Appendix I, we provide wallclock time comparison between simulating the path and our simulation-free approach. We see a 17x improvement in training speed even after taking into account neural network evaluation and gradient descent. This is compared to a 200 step baseline.\n\nWhile it may be true that fewer steps are needed for some manifolds, we note that this can be a tricky hyperparameter to tune. To the best of our knowledge, in the existing Riemannian diffusion model works [1, 2], the number of steps is tuned on each manifold and can be very different depending on the manifold (ranging from 100 to 1000). On the other hand, being able to perform exact sampling with a simulation-free approach completely foregoes the need to consider such a hyperparameter. Also note that the likelihood values shown in O.1 in the RSGM paper [2] (with up to 200 steps) are still quite inferior to the final results reported in Table 4 (using 1000 steps) in the main part of the paper [2].\n\n> Why does the proposed method outperform the Riemannian Diffusion model? \n\nA potential reason could be that we have zero numerical & approximation errors. Please see Appendix D, where we highlighted, in red, sources of potential errors during training between our framework and Riemannian diffusion. Namely, for diffusion models, both the sample $x_t$ and the âsupervision signalâ (either denoising or implicit score matching) must be approximated. This is not the case for RFM, where we have both in closed form for simple manifolds. Also, the noising processes in diffusion models do not reach the uniform distribution until infinite time, requiring yet another hyperparameter to tune which is the time horizon of the simulation.\n\n> Further, why does CNF Matching show superior performance on Earthquake and Flood datasets over the proposed method?\n\nWhereas RFM prescribes both the marginal probability path and the marginal vector field (which is being regressed onto), there is no unique vector field for a chosen probability path. CNF Matching takes advantage of this flexibility and prescribes only the marginal probability path and gives the model the freedom to choose any vector field that matches this probability path. It may be this extra freedom that is allowing CNF Matching to perform better. Note however, that CNF Matching has a biased loss that cannot scale as well as RFM. \n\n> Why is the result of the proposed method for Flood dataset in Table 2 highlighted in bold even though CNF Matching shows better result?\n\nApologies, this is a mistake on our part. It was not our intention to mislead, and we have fixed this. Thanks for catching this. We have also weakened some of our statements surrounding the experiments to reflect that we only achieve state-of-the-art on some but not all data sets that we consider.\n\n> Can the other diffusion models applied to general manifolds such as the triangular mesh? For example, RSGM seems to be applicable when using the denoised score matching with the Varadhan approximation.\n\nThere are two approaches for approximating the conditional score function that RSGM [2] proposed: (1) based on a truncated heat kernel expansion using eigendecomposition, and (2) based on the Varadhan approximation. The second option (2) actually will not work on general manifolds as it (i) requires the logarithm map globally and (ii) is only justified for small t values.\n\nFor approach (1), the truncated heat kernel expansion using eigendecomposition is possible, but the number of eigenfunctions required for reasonable approximation of the score is very high for RSGM. It is much easier to satisfy the properties of a premetric in our RFM framework---possible with a small finite numberâthan it is to approximate the heat kernel using eigenfunctions. Indeed, we **expanded the discussion on k and added extra illustrative examples in Appendix G.1** on comparing the number of eigenfunctions required by RSGM and RFM, where we see very large score approximation errors even on a simple 2D-sphere using 100s of eigenfunctions, while spectral distance already provides a valid premetric using 3 eigenfunctions. We believe this property is further exacerbated on more general complex manifolds.\n\nWe hope this answers the reviewerâs concerns. If we missed anything, please feel free to let us know.\n\n[1] Riemannian Diffusion Models. https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07949.\n\n[2] Riemannian Score-Based Generative Modelling. https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02763.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Authors response'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for their commendations and insightful questions. Below we address their main points:\n\n> the effect of k (the number of eigenfunctions) on the learned model.\n\nTheoretically we know there exists a finite (bounded) value of k that allows the spectral distances to satisfy our premetric conditions. To help provide intuition regarding the effect of $k$, we have **expanded the discussion and added a simple experiment in Appendix G.1** where we compare spectral distance and diffusion modelâs conditional probability on the 2D-sphere for different choices of $k$. The spectral distance changes only slightly for different $k$ and already separates all points for $k=3$ and is a valid premetric. Alongside this, we compare to diffusion models, which in contrast, require many more eigenfunctions to be able to concentrate probability mass at small time values $t$ and to get an accurate estimate of the conditional score function. In fact, regardless of how many eigenfunctions are used for diffusion the score approximation is always biased.\n\n\n> choice of scheduler.\n\nWe believe the optimal choice of scheduler depends on the data distribution itself, and it is difficult to infer at the time of training how to best choose a scheduler. For instance, [1] chooses a scheduler that minimizes the kinetic energy of the learned model (for the Euclidean case). It could be interesting to see how that translates to manifolds, but it does not seem trivial.\n\n\n> Is there any benefit to considering non-uniform base distributions? While the theory easily admits arbitrary base distributions, are there practical challenges in using non-uniform distributions?\n\nWe note first that the maze manifolds use Gaussian mixture models as base and target distributions, and the high-dimensional tori experiment uses a wrapped Gaussian. It is actually often harder to use a uniform distribution because in high dimensions, the volume grows exponentially (so density decreases exponentially). For manifolds with boundaries, ideally the base distribution does not have significant mass on the boundary itself. Overall, we arenât aware of any practical challenges of using non-uniform distributions. However, choosing a good base distribution is also unclear a priori; a good base distribution for generative modeling is perhaps one that is already close to the data distribution.\n\n\n> For instance, can we say anything about what makes a particular premetric ""good""? \n\nWe agree that being able to answer such questions can bring many insights into this and similar frameworks. However, we donât think there is a clear cut answer. Similar to the scheduler, it may very well be that a âgoodâ premetric depends on the data distribution. \n\n\n> Are there principled reasons someone would choose the diffusion distance over the biharmonic distance?\n\nDiffusion distances have a time parameter ($\\tau$) that can be tweaked to achieve certain properties. For example, as can be seen in Figure 2 in [1], that long time parameter provides a smoother overall distance field, while short time parameters is more isotropic near the source point at the cost of a more wiggly distance landscape. Practically, we note that the biharmonic is often easier to use as a first choice because of the lack of hyperparameters, where diffusion distance requires strict tuning of the time parameter which we found it is quite sensitive to.\n\n\n> Are spectral distances chosen in Section 3.2 primarily for practical reasons, or are there other aspects that make the corresponding premetrics desirable?\n\nSpectral distances have a certain computational benefit over geodesic distances as they can be computed on the fly between any pair of points on the manifold by simply computing the euclidean distance following a weighted eigenfunction embedding of these points. Apart from that, diffusion distances are intuitively constructed by averaging many random walks, so they end up being smoother and more robust to topological noise (e.g., holes, narrow passages). See https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0500334102, e.g., Figure 2, which initially motivated diffusion distances and diffusion maps. We see the benefit of spectral distances in Figure 1 (bottom row), where the geodesic (bottom-left) wants to always transport along the boundary, but this is not ideal as the marginal distribution ends up being a Dirac on the boundary. Spectral distances (bottom-right) avoid the boundary and allow for a diffeomorphic flow of mass within the manifold. \n\n\n> Is there a compelling reason spectral distances use the spectrum of Laplace-Beltrami operator, rather than some other operator?\n\nThe eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator are considered to be the most natural (or even, the âcorrectâ) generalization of the Fourier basis on the unit circle (arguably the simplest 1D compact manifold) to general manifolds. \n\n[1] On Kinetic Optimal Probability Paths for Generative Models. https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06626.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'This paper proposes Riemannian flow matching (RFM), a generalization of Euclidean flow matching techniques to arbitrary (complete and connected) Riemannian manifolds.

"['Seohong Park', 'Oleh Rybkin', 'Sergey Levine']",ICLR,METRA_ Scalable Unsupervised RL with Metric-Aware Abstraction,https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19745,2024," Unsupervised pre-training strategies have proven to be highly effective in natural language processing and computer vision. Likewise, unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of discovering a variety of potentially useful behaviors that can accelerate the learning of a wide array of downstream tasks. Previous unsupervised RL approaches have mainly focused on pure exploration and mutual information skill learning. However, despite the previous attempts, making unsupervised RL truly scalable still remains a major open challenge: pure exploration approaches might struggle in complex environments with large state spaces, where covering every possible transition is infeasible, and mutual information skill learning approaches might completely fail to explore the environment due to the lack of incentives. To make unsupervised RL scalable to complex, high-dimensional environments, we propose a novel unsupervised RL objective, which we call Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). Our main idea is, instead of directly covering the entire state space, to only cover a compact latent space $\mathcal{Z}$ that is metrically connected to the state space $\mathcal{S}$ by temporal distances. By learning to move in every direction in the latent space, METRA obtains a tractable set of diverse behaviors that approximately cover the state space, being scalable to high-dimensional environments. Through our experiments in five locomotion and manipulation environments, we demonstrate that METRA can discover a variety of useful behaviors even in complex, pixel-based environments, being the first unsupervised RL method that discovers diverse locomotion behaviors in pixel-based Quadruped and Humanoid.

While we agree that evaluating METRA on more diverse benchmarks like Atari games would further strengthen the paper, we would like to note that we have included a large fraction of the most widely used benchmarks for unsupervised RL and unsupervised skill discovery [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], including both locomotion and manipulation environments. Also, please understand that adapting the current METRA implementation to Atari games requires a considerable amount of time and work as they require a very different RL backbone (other than SAC) due to the difference in action spaces. (We also tried to find an existing unsupervised skill discovery implementation for Atari, but most prior methods do not evaluate on Atari games, and the only available [repository](https://github.com/mklissa/dceo) we found seems to require 5-7 days of training.) That being said, we believe further extending the idea behind METRA to other types of environments is an exciting future research direction.\n\nAs the reviewer pointed out, pure exploration approaches (e.g., RND) achieve decent performance in Atari games (sometimes in combination with extrinsic rewards), as games are often *intentionally* designed for the player to seek novel states or scenes. At the same time, however, pure exploration methods often fail in complex robotics environments (Fig. 3), where it is infeasible to visit every possible state. Having not evaluated METRA on Atari games, we cannot claim that METRA is better than pure exploration approaches on the Atari benchmark. However, we do believe that the idea behind METRA has better potential scalability in principle, as it does not attempt to cover every possible state (and as empirically shown in our experiments), unlike pure exploration methods. We hope that METRA provides a complementary aspect to existing unsupervised RL approaches, toward truly scalable unsupervised RL. We have revised the limitation section regarding this point in the updated manuscript (Appendix A).\n\n\nWe thank the reviewer again for the helpful feedback and please let us know if there are any additional concerns or questions.\n\n[1] Ferns et al., Metrics for finite Markov decision processes (2004).\n\n[2] Castro et al., Scalable methods for computing state similarity in deterministic Markov decision processes (2020).\n\n[3] Eysenbach et al., Diversity is all you need: Learning skills without a reward function (2019).\n\n[4] Sharma et al., Dynamics-aware unsupervised discovery of skills (2020).\n\n[5] Mendonca et al., Discovering and achieving goals via world models (2021).\n\n[6] Laskin et al., Urlb: Unsupervised reinforcement learning benchmark (2021).\n\n[7] He et al., Wasserstein unsupervised reinforcement learning (2022).\n\n[8] Park et al., Lipschitz-constrained unsupervised skill discovery (2022).\n\n[9] Zhao et al., A mixture of surprises for unsupervised reinforcement learning (2022).\n\n[10] Shafiullah and Pinto, One after another: Learning incremental skills for a changing world (2022).\n\n[11] Laskin et al., Unsupervised reinforcement learning with contrastive intrinsic control (2022).\n\n[12] Park et al., Controllability-aware unsupervised skill discovery (2023).\n\n[13] Yang et al., Behavior contrastive learning for unsupervised skill discovery (2023).'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the thorough review and constructive feedback about this work. Below, we present new ablation study results and provide answers to the questions. We believe that these changes strengthen the paper, and welcome additional suggestions for further improving the work.\n\n* **âCould METRA be modified to model non-linear skills even in the latent space?â**, **Ablation study on approximated objectives**\n\nYes, it is possible to modify METRA to model non-linear skills in the latent space by using the *full* $\\psi(z)$ form (instead of simplifying it with $\\psi(z) = z$ in Eq. 7), and we discuss this full version of METRA in detail in Appendix E.3. Below, we empirically compare METRA with the original version before the $\\psi(z)=z$ simplification (Eq. 6). We test two different dimensionalities for $\\psi$ ($D=2$ and $D=16$).\n\n| Environment | DIAYN | DADS | METRA (full, $D=2$) | METRA (full, $D=16$) | METRA (simplified) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| HalfCheetah | $2.00 \\pm 0.00$ | $2.75 \\pm 0.96$ | $\\mathbf{183.50} \\pm 10.85$ | $155.75 \\pm 4.35$ | $171.75 \\pm 1.71$ |\n| Ant | $4.75 \\pm 0.96$ | $7.25 \\pm 1.71$ | $\\mathbf{2398.50} \\pm 51.00$ | $2209.00 \\pm 37.21$ | $2307.25 \\pm 150.14$ |\n\nThe table above shows the results (policy state coverage) on Ant and HalfCheetah (at epoch 10000, 4 seeds each). In these environments, while both the simplified version (with $\\psi(z) = z$) and the full version (without setting $\\psi(z) = z$) perform similarly, the setting with $D=16$ exhibits slightly slower learning due to the added complexity. \n\nIn general, we believe using the full version of METRA could lead to more diverse skills in highly complex environments, as there is less restriction on latent behaviors (though it could be more computationally expensive or relatively harder to optimize). Another interesting aspect of the full METRA objective is that it resembles contrastive learning (Appendix E.3). As such, combining the full version of METRA with contrastive learning techniques may further help scale up the idea of METRA to more complex or even real-world environments, which we leave for future work.\n\n* **âAre there any other metrics that are promising for their applications to the reinforcement learning setting in the METRA framework?â**\n\nAs the reviewer pointed out, it is possible to combine our WDM objective (Eq. 3) with distance metrics other than temporal distances. For example, as mentioned in Sec 4.2, LSD (a previous unsupervised skill discovery method) can be viewed as a special case of WDM with the *Euclidean* distance metric (though this is not as universally applicable as the temporal distance metric). Another potentially interesting metric is the bisimulation metric [1, 2], which measures the similarity between states based on both environment dynamics *and* a reward function. Although this metric requires a pre-defined reward function(s), it may serve as a way to inject human priors about tasks into unsupervised learning of skills. We believe considering and comparing various distance metrics (or quasimetrics) is an interesting future research direction.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the thorough review and constructive feedback about this work. Please find our answers to the questions below. We welcome additional suggestions for further improving the work.\n\n* **âIf we apply METRA to a traditional RL setting with external rewards, how would the discovered skills help in finding task-specific policies?â**\n\nIn Section 5, we have (already) shown two ways to utilize skills learned by METRA for downstream tasks. First, we train hierarchical high-level policies $\\pi^h(z|s)$ that selects skills as temporally extended actions. In Fig. 6, we show that the high-level policies (trained on fixed METRA skills) effectively solve challenging downstream tasks defined by external rewards (e.g., jumping over multiple hurdles, navigating through multiple goals, etc.). Second, specifically for *goal-reaching* tasks, METRA provides a very simple way to directly select a skill in a *zero-shot* manner (Section 4.2). We empirically demonstrate this capability of METRA in Fig. 8, which shows that METRA achieves the best zero-shot goal-reaching performance.\n\nMoreover, while we did not mention in the paper, we can also combine METRA with *successor features* by noting that the METRA reward $(\\phi(sâ) - \\phi(s))^\\top z$ can be interpreted as the inner product between the feature vector $\\tilde \\phi(s, a, sâ) = \\phi(sâ) - \\phi(s)$ and the task vector $z$. Based on this interpretation, we can compute via linear regression the most suitable skill $z$ for *any arbitrary reward function* in a zero-shot manner, similarly to successor feature methods. We are currently working on this as a follow-up to METRA.\n\n* **âDoes METRA have the potential to be applied to environments with temporal dependencies (NetHack, MineDojo, ...)?â**\n\nMETRA can be applied to any fully observable MDP in principle. However, METRA in its current form does not particularly deal with partially observable environments (e.g., Minecraft), like many prior works in unsupervised skill discovery [1, 2, 3, 4]. We believe this limitation can be resolved by considering *observation histories*, and combining METRA with world models that use recurrent structures (e.g., Dreamer) would be an exciting future research direction. We have clarified this limitation in the revised manuscript (Appendix A).\n\nWe thank the reviewer again for the helpful feedback and please let us know if there are any additional concerns or questions.\n\n[1] Eysenbach et al., Diversity is all you need: Learning skills without a reward function (2019).\n\n[2] Sharma et al., Dynamics-aware unsupervised discovery of skills (2020).\n\n[3] Park et al., Lipschitz-constrained unsupervised skill discovery (2022).\n\n[4] Laskin et al., Unsupervised reinforcement learning with contrastive intrinsic control (2022).'}}, {'comment': {'value': '* **Applying METRA to other types of environments such as Atari or Google Research Football**\n\nThank you for the suggestion.

We leave devising an unsupervised RL algorithm for non-stationary environments and continual learning settings for future work. We believe one potential way to deal with this issue is to combine METRA with recurrent latent state spaces [14].

Below, we describe how we have added new comparisons with DGPO and a new ablation study with different sizes of latent states. We believe that these changes strengthen the paper, and welcome additional suggestions for further improving the work.\n\n* **Additional baseline â DGPO**\n\nThank you for suggesting the new baselines. We additionally compared METRA with DGPO [2] on the MuJoCo Ant and HalfCheetah environments. With the addition of this comparison, the paper compares to a total of $12$ different methods.\n\nSince DGPO [2] (as well as RSPO [1]) was originally proposed for the quality diversity (QD) setting (i.e., learn diverse behaviors *while maximizing rewards*), unlike our unsupervised RL setting (i.e., learn diverse behaviors *without rewards*), we only use the intrinsic motivation part of DGPO for our experiments. Specifically, we use $\\min_{zâ \\neq z} \\log{\\frac{q(z|sâ)}{q(z|sâ) + q(zâ|sâ)}}$ as the reward function for DGPO.\n\n| Environment (Metric) | DIAYN | DGPO | METRA (ours) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| HalfCheetah (policy state coverage) | $6.75 \\pm 2.22$ | $6.75 \\pm 2.06$ | $\\mathbf{186.75} \\pm 16.21$ |\n| HalfCheetah (total state coverage) | $19.50 \\pm 3.87$ | $22.25 \\pm 5.85$ | $\\mathbf{177.75} \\pm 17.10$ |\n| Ant (policy state coverage) | $11.25 \\pm 5.44$ | $7.00 \\pm 3.83$ | $\\mathbf{1387.75} \\pm 77.38$ |\n| Ant (total state coverage) | $107.75 \\pm 17.00$ | $121.50 \\pm 4.36$ | $\\mathbf{6313.25} \\pm 747.92$ |\n\nThe table above compares the performances of METRA, DIAYN, and DGPO on Ant and HalfCheetah (at epoch 10000, 4 seeds each). The results suggest that both DIAYN and DGPO struggle to cover the state space in the absence of supervision. This is an expected result, given that DGPO also considers a **KL divergence** as a divergence measure, which is a *metric-agnostic* quantity. As such, DGPO shares the same limitation as DIAYN of not necessarily encouraging exploration (Section 2). Hence, while DGPO succeeds in the QD setting with the guidance of rewards, it does not necessarily achieve strong performance in our unsupervised settings.\n\nThat being said, we believe combining existing KL-based intrinsic rewards, such as DGPO, with our temporal distance-based **Wasserstein** metric could potentially lead to another performant unsupervised RL algorithm, which we leave for future work. We have updated the new results in the draft (Appendix F.4).\n\n* **How does the dimensionality of the latent space affect the performance of METRA? Is there a trade-off between the dimensionality of the latent space and the complexity of the behaviors that can be learned?**\n\nAs the reviewer pointed out, the size of the latent skill space affects the performance of METRA. Since METRA maximizes state coverage *under the capacity of the latent space $\\mathcal{Z}$*, a too small skill latent space could lead to less diverse skills. To empirically demonstrate this, we evaluate METRA with 1-D, 2-D, and 4-D continuous skills as well as 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 discrete skills on MuJoCo Ant and HalfCheetah.\n\n| Environment | \\| | 1-D skills | 2-D skills | 4-D skills | \\| | 2 skills | 4 skills | 8 skills | 16 skills | 24 skills |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| HalfCheetah | \\| | $-17.84 \\pm 4.09$ | $-12.86 \\pm 1.51$ | $\\mathbf{-11.16} \\pm 0.89$ | \\| | $-26.76 \\pm 12.36$ | $-10.85 \\pm 1.80$ | $-11.43 \\pm 0.63$ | $\\mathbf{-9.97} \\pm 1.52$ | $-12.10 \\pm 1.75$ |\n| Ant | \\| | $-29.11 \\pm 6.35$ | $-7.58 \\pm 3.90$ | $\\mathbf{-7.54} \\pm 0.90$ | \\| | $-23.42 \\pm 4.00$ | $-13.81 \\pm 3.69$ | $-10.64 \\pm 4.25$ | $-8.96 \\pm 1.78$ | $\\mathbf{-7.28} \\pm 1.71$ |\n\nThe table above shows the goal-reaching performances (negative goal distance, the higher the better) of different skill latent spaces (at epoch 10000, 4 seeds each). In general, the diversity of skill (and thus goal-reaching performance) increases as the capacity of $\\mathcal{Z}$ grows. However, using a too large skill space may slow down the training of the skill policy, as the agent needs to learn more behaviors. We have added qualitative results from these experiments to the revised draft (Appendix F.3).'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""We thank the reviewer for the thorough review and constructive feedback about this work. Please find our answers to the questions below. We welcome additional suggestions for further improving the work.\n\n* **Failure of DIAYN/LEXA in goal-conditioned tasks**\n\nAs the reviewer pointed out, DIAYN and LEXA struggle with complex goal-conditioned tasks. This is mainly because they often fail to cover the state space, as shown in Figure 3 (for LEXA, please refer to the âP2E/Disag.â column, which is the exploration method LEXA uses). This is an expected result, given that DIAYN maximizes mutual information, which does not necessarily encourage exploration (Section 2), and LEXA (a pure exploration method) struggles in complex environments, where it is infeasible to completely cover every possible state or fully capture environment dynamics.\n\n* **Does the advantage of METRA mainly come from visual learning?**, **âWill the proposed method still outperform if we only consider state-based tasks?â**\n\nIn our experiments, Ant and HalfCheetah are state-based environments (Fig. 4), in which METRA outperforms most previous unsupervised RL methods by significant margins (Fig. 5, Fig. 7). This suggests that the performance gain mainly comes from our objective, not from visual representation learning. In state-based environments, however, LSD (a previous Euclidean-distance maximizing skill discovery method) shows comparable performance to METRA. Yet, LSD fails to scale to pixel-based environments because Euclidean distances do not necessarily provide meaningful learning signals in pixels.\n\nThe fact that the performance gain of METRA mainly comes from its objective becomes further clearer if we contrast the objectives of DIAYN and METRA: DIAYN essentially minimizes $\\\\\\|\\phi(s) - z\\\\\\|_2^2$ (Appendix E.1), while METRA maximizes $(\\phi(s') - \\phi(s))^\\top z$ under the $\\\\\\|\\phi(s) - \\phi(s')\\\\\\|_2 \\leq 1$ constraint (Eq. 8). They both have the exactly same (visual) encoder $\\phi$ in their objectives, but the results are very different (Fig. 3). This is, again, because mutual information does not encourage the agent to cover the state space (Section 2).\n\n* **âIn Figure 7, some methods are very unstable on the Kitchen tasks (variance of different seeds is large). Can the authors give any reason?â**\n\nWe believe this is mainly because we use a *queue* (or *policy*) coverage metric for Kitchen, while we use a *total* coverage metric for the other environments (please refer to Appendix G.1 for details). The rationale behind this choice is that, as mentioned in Sec 5.3, most methods max out the total coverage metric in Kitchen. The queue coverage metric in Kitchen measures the number of achieved subtasks from the trajectories within a specific window. Exploration methods may exhibit high variances in this metric since they may visit different parts of the space on different iterations. That being said, we would like to note that METRA outperforms the best exploration method for Kitchen (P2E = LEXA) in a different goal-reaching metric by a statistically significant margin (Fig. 8).\n\nWe thank the reviewer again for the helpful feedback and please let us know if there are any additional concerns or questions.""}}, {'summary': {'value': 'This paper introduces a novel unsupervised RL objective called Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA).

This novel approach ensures that the skills are estimated within a manifold preserving the temporal properties of the state space, allowing for maximization of spread-out trajectories over time. The incorporation of a metric, specifically temporal distance, grounds the latent space to be compact, distinguishing it from previous metric-agnostic alternatives relying solely on mutual information.

One of the key advantages of pre-training RL agents using this objective lies in its scalability, enabling the learning of a compact skill space even from high-dimensional observations, such as images, where prior methods faced challenges in scalability.

Likewise, unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of discovering a variety of potentially useful behaviors that can accelerate the learning of a wide array of downstream tasks. Previous unsupervised RL approaches have mainly focused on pure exploration and mutual information skill learning. However, despite the previous attempts, making unsupervised RL truly scalable still remains a major open challenge: pure exploration approaches might struggle in complex environments with large state spaces, where covering every possible transition is infeasible, and mutual information skill learning approaches might completely fail to explore the environment due to the lack of incentives. To make unsupervised RL scalable to complex, high-dimensional environments, we propose a novel unsupervised RL objective, which we call Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). Our main idea is, instead of directly covering the entire state space, to only cover a compact latent space $\\mathcal{Z}$ that is metrically connected to the state space $\\mathcal{S}$ by temporal distances. By learning to move in every direction in the latent space, METRA obtains a tractable set of diverse behaviors that approximately cover the state space, being scalable to high-dimensional environments. Through our experiments in five locomotion and manipulation environments, we demonstrate that METRA can discover a variety of useful behaviors even in complex, pixel-based environments, being the first unsupervised RL method that discovers diverse locomotion behaviors in pixel-based Quadruped and Humanoid.

We are glad that you have appreciated our work!\n\nIndeed, FID is not suitable for Bayesian reconstruction problems and as far as we are concerned, there are no other consistent methods that permit a reliable assessment of such reconstructions. Note that in the particular case where the posterior is concentrated, it is possible to âconfidentlyâ compare different reconstruction algorithms, through the LPIPS metric using the groundtruth image. However, we have been particularly interested in ill-posed problems, where this type of comparisons is not relevant. One line of exploration could be to run MCGDiff with a very large number of particles and use the resulting samples as a groundtruth with some metric over distributions, for example the sliced Wasserstein distance.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Dear reviewer,\nWe thank you for the time and effort taken to review our manuscript. Regarding your comments: \n- We think that the point 3 is an empirical contribution in itself since we show that the current methods used for solving linear inverse problems with diffusion do not actually correctly sample the posterior in the most straightforward cases. \n- While we agree that our method is computationally more expensive than existing works such as DDRM and DPS, we believe that this is the price to pay to obtain more faithful approximations of the posterior. Indeed, as we show in the Gaussian mixture experiment, DPS and DDRM do not actually sample approximately from the posterior and cannot be made more precise using more computational resources. On the other hand, our method has an extra parameter (the number of particles $N$) which controls the accuracy of the approximation. We firmly believe that there is an intrinsic tradeoff between accuracy and computational burden when dealing with the posteriors of generative models. That being said, in moderate dimensions, drawing $N$ parallel samples from DPS or DDRM has the same computational cost as running one particle filter with $N$ particles, which returns $N$ samples that approximate the posterior (the resampling cost is negligible in front of the cost of running the diffusion). In much larger dimensions, taking $N$ particles in MCGDiff will result in $N$ collapsed particles, which is not qualitatively the same thing as running DPS or DDRM with $N$ samples. However, we advocate in our experiments that in such cases, one should use a small number of particles and instead run $M$ parallel MCGDiff with $N/M$ particles, to obtain a particle approximation of the posterior with $M$ different and independent particles. In such cases, the computational cost of our algorithm is larger than that of DPS and DDRM (in the sense that with the same computational cost you can draw $N$ i.i.d. samples from DPS and DDRM). While it is true that the particles from a single particle filter lack diversity in global level features, still, we believe that the quality of our proposal allows us to draw samples in the support of the posterior, and not outside, as it is the case of the other methods. Hence running parallel particle filters allows us to have samples that are globally diverse. \n- For our imaging experiments, we believe that no method can quantitatively assert the performances of all three algorithms, as we do not have samples from the posterior to compare to. This is precisely the reason why we focus on tractable experiments in the main paper. In the appendix though, we have compared MCGDiff and other algorithms in some image tasks by at first generating 100 samples from the posterior and then showing the 2 samples from those that are the furthest apart. We can see that MCGDiff seems to obtain more coherent samples, even though, as we said before, this is purely a qualitative evaluation and is of course subject to discussion.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Dear reviewer,\nWe thank you for the time and effort taken to review our manuscript. We are glad that you have appreciated our work and thank you for the positive feedback!\n\n The code that is currently available in the anonymous git will be available once the submission process is over.

We thank you for the points that you raised concerning the bibliography and the speed issues and will be integrating it into the main text in the future. We will also add a precise pseudo code that reflects exactly the source code, in the appendix.\n\n- We would like to point out that we refrain from comparing to the ground truth. Indeed, our main focus on the numerical part is indeed the mixture of gaussians and mixture of funnel cases. The main reason is that in those cases it is possible to have access to samples from the real posterior and we show that our algorithm outperforms the competition in all settings and manages to match well the posterior.\n\n- Indeed in figure 5 and 6 we see that unlike the other existing methods, MCGDiff finds all the modes but in some cases the tails of each mode are thinner. A straightforward answer to your question, relying on the theorems presented in the main paper, would be to increase the number of particles being used. There are also other alternatives, as for example using the unadjusted Langevin algorithm initialized at the particles resulting from MCGDiff and targeting the posterior of the model. This requires having the score at time 0, to which we may not have access as the data distribution may not have a density in practice. However, we can replace it with the score at some timestep epsilon, close to 0. We have tried this method and in some cases it leads to better spreading around the mode and smaller sliced Wasserstein distance. \n\n- The current work is an effort to handle bayesian linear inverse problems when using a pre-trained denoising diffusion generative model as a prior, without any need of (further) training. In this sense, the measurement $y$ can be a noisy linear observation of the state. But if we understand your question correctly, it concerns the training data for the underlying generative model, which we do not have control over as we use off the shelf trained diffusion models. However, if one has some prior information on the noise present in the dataset, perhaps there might a path forward. This is a really interesting yet difficult question that we believe is outside the scope of the current paper.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'The authors introduce a method for addressing ill-posed inverse problems by employing a diffusion-based neural network model guided by Monte Carlo sampling.

The performance improvement was obvious, however, they often fail to address inherent ambiguities of matching, such as textureless regions, repetitive patterns, large displacements, or noises. To address this, we propose DiffMatch, a novel conditional diffusion-based framework designed to explicitly model both the data and prior terms for dense matching. This is accomplished by leveraging a conditional denoising diffusion model that explic- itly takes matching cost and injects the prior within generative process. However, limited input resolution of the diffusion model is a major hindrance. We address this with a cascaded pipeline, starting with a low-resolution model, followed by a super-resolution model that successively upsamples and incorporates finer details to the matching field. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements of our method over existing approaches, and the ablation studies validate our design choices along with the effectiveness of each component.

Regarding the prior term.**\n\nThank you for your question. Firstly, we would like to clarify that $F_\\mathrm{init}$ is a condition for noise restoration in the Conditional Denoising Diffusion Module, closely related to the âdata termâ derived from the data, $I_\\mathrm{src}$ and $I_\\mathrm{tgt}$.\n\nMore specifically, in a probabilistic interpretation, the objective for dense correspondence includes a âdataâ term, which measures matching evidence between source and target features, and a âpriorâ term, encoding prior knowledge about correspondence. Specifically, the âpriorâ term in our paper discusses the formation of the matching field manifold and the distribution of the ground-truth flow field.\n\nTraditional methods [1,2,3,4] typically reduce this matching prior to a hand-crafted âsmoothnessâ constraint, suggesting that the flow at one point should be similar to those of its surrounding points. In contrast, current learning-based methods [5,6,7,8] emphasize the âdataâ term by training neural networks under the assumption that the network architecture itself can learn the optimal matching prior with a large-scale training dataset. However, our paper is the first to propose learning both the âdataâ and âpriorâ term simultaneously for dense correspondence, utilizing a diffusion-based generative model. We welcome any further questions you may have. Thank you.\n\n**Citations:**\n\n[1] Javier SÃ¡nchez PÃ©rez, Enric Meinhardt-Llopis, and Gabriele Facciolo. Tv-l1 optical ï¬ow estimation.

As you rightly pointed out, $F_\\mathrm{init}$, derived from feature descriptors, plays a crucial role in providing an initial guess within our framework. In response to your suggestion, we tested DiffMatch using an alternative feature backboneâResNet [1]. It's important to note that our model was initially pre-trained using VGG-16. Ideally, for this analysis, the model should have been trained with ResNet. However, due to the time constraints of the rebuttal period, we simply replaced the $F_\\mathrm{init}$ of our VGG-16 pre-trained DiffMatch with a flow field derived from ResNet101 during the sampling phase. **We observed that the initial flow field derived from ResNet feature descriptors was effectively refined by DiffMatch, despite the model not being originally trained with the ResNet backbone.** Nevertheless, it showed lower performance compared to our original results. We believe this is due to two main reasons: firstly, our model was not trained with ResNet, and secondly, the $F_\\mathrm{init}$ from ResNet demonstrated lower accuracy than that from VGG-16 in our evaluation dataset, ETH3D. We plan to train our model with different feature backbones, such as ResNet or DINO [2]. We intend to include these results in our paper as soon as the experiments are complete.\n\n|  | ETH3D AEPEâ |\n| --- | --- |\n|  $F_\\mathrm{init}$ by ResNet101 | 16.78 |\n| DiffMatch combined with ResNet101 | 5.74 |\n| $F_{init}\u200b$ by VGG16 | 14.27 |\n| DiffMatch combined with VGG16 | **3.12** |\n\nMoreover, as we addressed in Weaknesses 2 & 3, our findings demonstrate that DiffMatch significantly enhances semantic matching performance on both PF-PASCAL and PF-WILLOW when integrated with SD-DINO. **This suggests the possibility of using other dense matching models as alternative backbones for DiffMatch, potentially enhancing their performance.**\n\nWe plan to evaluate DiffMatch on additional datasets and explore the possibility of integrating our model as a plug-in for other models to make it more lightweight.

Regarding novelty.**\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback. Firstly, we would like to emphasize that a key novelty of our work is the novel formulation of dense correspondence as a diffusion generative process, a point also positively acknowledged by reviewers **8Vji**, **kgjX**, and **nL9F**. Our approach differs from previous methods [1,2,3] that relied on hand-crafted design prior terms or recent studies [4,5,6] that focus on the data term, assuming that the network architecture learns optimal matching priors with large-scale training datasets. Our unique contribution lies in **learning both the âdataâ and âpriorâ terms by leveraging a powerful generative model, the diffusion model**, demonstrating its effectiveness in the challenging dense correspondence task.\n\nRegarding the novelty of our architecture design, we have conducted additional ablation studies compared with previous works [7,8,9,10] that applied diffusion models for specific dense predictions, such as semantic segmentation [7,8] and monocular depth estimation [7,9,10]. These studies typically use a single RGB image or feature descriptor as a condition for predictions aligned with the input RGB image. A concurrent study [11] has also applied a diffusion model to predict optical flow, using concatenated feature descriptors from both source and target images. However, this model is limited to scenarios with small displacements, typically in the optical flow task, which differs from the main focus of our study. DiffMatch, in contrast, aims to predict dense correspondence between two RGB images, $I_\\mathrm{src}$ and $I_\\mathrm{tgt}$, in scenarios involving textureless regions, repetitive patterns, large displacements, or noise. To achieve this, **we introduced a novel conditioning method using a local cost volume $C^{l}$ and initial flow field $F_\\mathrm{init}$**, which captures pixel-wise interactions and initial guesses of dense correspondence between the images.\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of our architecture, in response to your insightful suggestion, we trained our model using only feature descriptors from the source and target, $D_\\mathrm{src}$ and $D_\\mathrm{tgt}$, as conditions. Please note that this approach is similar in architectural design to [7] and [11]. The quantitative results, which compare different conditioning methods, show that our conditioning method significantly outperforms those using only two feature descriptors. We attribute these results to our architectural design, which is specifically tailored for dense correspondence. Table 4 in the âSection 5.3 ABLATION STUDYâ of our main paper further demonstrates the effectiveness of each component in our architecture. We will ensure to include an extended discussion and additional ablation studies on this aspect in the final version of our paper.

Discussion on integration with other methods.**\n\nThank you for your insightful question. In the Appendix, Table 6 and Figure 8 in âSection C.3 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GENERATIVE MATCHING PRIORâ present a comparison between the initial flow field $F_\\mathrm{init}$, derived from raw correlation, and the refined flow field resulting from DiffMatch on the harshly corrupted HPatches and ETH3D. While the raw correlation results in poor performance, with Average Endpoint Errors (AEPEs) of 165.0 and 96.30 respectively, DiffMatch effectively refines this poor initialization using the diffusion generative prior, achieving significantly better performance with AEPEs of 33.15 and 26.45, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, as you insightfully suggested, considering the relationship between the initial flow and overall performance, there seems to be substantial potential for performance enhancement by using results from other models as the initial flow field. We appreciate your excellent suggestion. One issue under consideration is the need to extract the results of existing models for training. Due to time constraints, we were unable to conduct this experiment. However, we chose a simpler approach which replaces $F_\\mathrm{init}$ in our VGG-16 pre-trained model with the flow field obtained from a pre-trained PDC-Net+. Unfortunately, as shown in the below table, we did not find any improvement over the performance of our paper. We think this is because the flow field from PDC-Net+ differs significantly from the VGG-16 $F_\\mathrm{init}$ used in the training phase. The flow field from PDC-Net+ tends to produce much smoother results compared to the flow field from raw correlation, as PDC-Net+ learns smoothness in their network with a large-scale dataset.\n\n|  | ETH3D AEPEâ | C-ETH3D AEPEâ |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DiffMatch  | **3.12** | **26.45** |\n| PDC-Net+  | 3.14 | 27.11 |\n| DiffMatch combined with PDC-Net+  | 3.55 | 26.49 |\n\nInstead, we evaluated our method on the semantic matching datasets PF-PASCAL [1] and PF-WILLOW [2].

Please note that SD-DINO uses intermediate diffusion features in a pre-trained diffusion model, so there is no need for training or fine-tuning. We believe that not training the neural network and directly using the feature descriptors from the diffusion model seems to provide more adequate initial flow field for our network. **Interestingly, we found that DiffMatch notably improves semantic matching performance compared to the original SD-DINO on both PF-PASCAL and PF-WILLOW.** **This indicates the potential of our Conditional Denoising Diffusion Module to be integrated on top of other dense correspondence methods to enhance their performance.**\n\n| Datasets |  | PF-PASCAL |  |  | PF-WILLOW |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Methods | PCK@0.05 | PCK@0.1 | PCK@0.15 | PCK@0.05 | PCK@0.1 | PCK@0.15 |\n| PDC-Net+ | 34.34 | 56.84 | 70.13 | 30.81 | 54.71 | 68.56 |\n| SD-DINO | **71.67** | 86.04 | 91.92 | 67.26 | 88.61 | 94.32 |\n| DiffMatch combined with SD-DINO | 70.67 | **88.69** | **95.15** | **67.37** | **89.39** | **95.29** |\n\nWe find your suggestion very promising and plan to explore integrating our model as a plug-in for other models to make it more lightweight.

As you mentioned, leveraging a global cost volume might indeed provide the model with pixel-wise interaction between given images, potentially enhancing performance. However, as you rightly pointed out, we have empirically found that the increased memory consumption required to build the cost volume, along with the increased channel dimension, pose significant challenges. To address this, as you kindly proposed, utilizing a global cost volume at a lower resolution could be an effective strategy to establish a coarse flow field. We are planning to conduct experiments that leverage a coarsely estimated flow field, derived from a global cost volume, as the initial flow field instead of those derived from raw cost volume. This approach, we anticipate, could further improve the overall performance of our model by providing a better initialization.

First, we would like to clarify that our method is trained using DPED-COCO [1], which augments synthetic image pairs from DPED with randomly sampled independently moving objects from MS-COCO. This allows our model to alleviate overfitting to synthetic homography and enables it to generalize to non-rigid transformations.\n\nAs you thankfully suggest, we explore other datasets to evaluate the generalizability of our model. We wish to clarify that our method is specifically tailored for challenging dense correspondence tasks, including textureless regions, repetitive patterns, large displacements, or noise. In contrast, the KITTI and RobotCar datasets, which contain road sequences captured by stereo cameras, typically exhibit relatively small displacements and do not align with our primary objective. Similarly, ScanNet and YFCC100M are used for evaluating sparse matching tasks in outdoor and indoor pose estimation, respectively, while our focus is on dense matching. Recent works [2,3] have been evaluated on these datasets, post-processing the results with RANSAC [4]. This was achieved as the goal of these works is to estimate uncertainty of the predicted matches, so that they selectively choose confident matches to find homography by RANSAC.\n\nTo address your concerns regarding generalizability, **we have extended our evaluation to include the MegaDepth dataset**, known for its large-scale collection of image pairs with extreme viewpoint and appearance variations.

Discussion about matching prior.**\n> Exactly how is the prior ""learned within the model architecture""?\n\nThank you for your constructive question. We would like to clarify that the concept of âthe matching prior within the model architectureâ has been already discussed in previous works [1,2,3]. These studies argue that the matching prior inherently exists within the model architecture or is learned from large-scale training datasets. However, as you insightfully asked, âhow the prior is captured in the model architecture and how much it isâ might be challenging to precisely visualize, because we regard the âprior termâ as encoding the general prior knowledge of correspondence and matching field manifold.\n\nAs earlier methods [4,5,6] design a hand-crafted prior term as a smoothness constraint, we can assume that the ""smoothness"" of the flow field is included in this ""prior"" knowledge of the matching field. Based on this understanding, we reinterpret Table 6 and Figure 8 in ""Section C.3 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GENERATIVE MATCHING PRIOR"", showing the comparison between the results of raw correlation and learning-based methods [7,8,9]. Previous learning-based approaches predict the matching field with raw correlation between an image pair as a condition. We observe that despite the absence of an explicit prior term in these methods, the qualitative results from them exhibit notably smoother results compared to raw correlation. This difference serves as indicative evidence that the neural network architecture may implicitly learn the matching prior with a large-scale dataset. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the concept of ""prior"" extends beyond mere ""smoothnessâ. This broader understanding underlines the importance of explicitly learning both the data and prior terms simultaneously, as proposed in our paper. We will make sure to include this extended discussion in the final version of our paper.

We wish to clarify that our method is specifically tailored for challenging dense correspondence tasks, including textureless regions, repetitive patterns, large displacements, or noise. In contrast, the KITTI dataset, which contains road sequences captured by stereo cameras, typically exhibits relatively small displacements and does not align with our primary objective. Similarly, ScanNet and YFCC100M are used for evaluating sparse matching tasks in outdoor and indoor pose estimation, respectively, while our focus is on dense matching. Recent works [1,2] evaluated on these datasets, by post-processing the results with RANSAC [3]. This was achieved as the goal of these works is to estimate uncertainty of the predicted matches, so that they selectively choose confident matches to find homography by RANSAC.\n\nTo address your concerns regarding generalizability, **we have extended our evaluation to include the MegaDepth dataset, known for its large-scale collection of image pairs with extreme viewpoint and appearance variations.** Following the procedure of PDC-Net+ [2], we tested on 1600 images.

More discussions or baselines about some diffusion-enabled dense prediction networks.**\n\n> Adding more discussions / baselines to some diffusion-enabled dense prediction networks.\n\n\nThank you for your question. First, we wish to clarify that the previous methods [1,2,3,4] applying a diffusion model for dense prediction, such as semantic segmentation [1,2], or monocular depth estimation [1,3,4], use a single RGB image or its feature descriptor as a condition to predict specific dense predictions, such as segmentation or depth map, aligned with the input RGB image. A concurrent study [5] has applied a diffusion model to predict optical flow, concatenating feature descriptors from both source and target images as input conditions. However, it is notable that this model is limited to scenarios involving small displacements, typical in optical flow tasks, which differ from the main focus of our study. In contrast, our objective is to predict dense correspondence between two RGB images, source $I_\\mathrm{src}$ and target $I_\\mathrm{tgt}$, in more challenging scenarios such as image pairs containing textureless regions, repetitive patterns, large displacements, or noise. To achieve this, we introduce a novel conditioning method which leverages a local cost volume $C^{l}$ and initial flow field $F_\\mathrm{init}$ between two images as conditions, containing the pixel-wise interaction between the given images and the initial guess of dense correspondence, respectively.\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of our architecture design, as you have thankfully suggested, we train our model using only feature descriptors from source and target, $D_\\mathrm{src}$ and $D_\\mathrm{tgt}$, as conditions. Please note that this method could be a similar architecture design to DDP [1] and DDVM [5], which only condition the feature descriptors from input RGB images. We present quantitative results to compare different conditioning methods and observe that the results with our conditioning method significantly outperform those using two feature descriptors. We believe that the observed results are attributed to the considerable architectural design choice, specifically tailored for dense correspondence. Table 4 in ""Section 5.3 ABLATION STUDY"" of the main paper also shows the effectiveness of each component in our architecture. We will make sure to include this extended discussion and ablation studies on this aspect in the final version of our paper.

With this structure they are able to achieve competitive results compared to the SOTA in dense correspondence matching. The use of a diffusion model to model the data prior of their system implies that the proposed solution is actually a generative system that given an initial dense matching field can sample plausible output ones; as a by-product of this formulation the authors propose to model matching uncertainty as discrepancies in the sampling process with some preliminary interesting results.'}, 'soundness': {'value': '2 fair'}, 'presentation': {'value': '3 good'}, 'contribution': {'value': '3 good'}, 'strengths': {'value': '+ **Novel formulation of the problem**: to the best of my knowledge I have not seen a diffusion model used in this context to refine a matching field. \n\n+ **Possibility to model uncertainty**: the proposed formulation models a distribution of plausible matching fields given an initial guess and therefore models implicitly the uncertainty of the matching process.

For example in the extreme case where the method is trained only with match fields coming from homographies it will probably not generalize well to other types of non-rigid transformations between frames. The competitors have this type of limitation in a less pronounced way since they focus on improving feature extraction and matching rather than modeling a global prior on what a âgood matching fieldâ should look like. Whether this problem arises in practice is hard to estimate from the current paper since the experimental validation is rather limited compared to the main competitors.T he proposed method is evaluated only on two datasets for dense correspondence matching and on two corrupted versions of the same datasets. Competitors like GOCor, PDCNet and PDCNet+ are evaluated on other datasets (e.g., MegaDepth and RobotCar) and additional correspondence tasks (e.g., Optical Flow on KITTI, Pose Estimation on YFCC100M and ScanNet).\n\nb) **Inference time concerns**: Tab. 5 of the paper compares the inference time of PDCNet(+) vs the proposed method with 5 sampling steps and shows that the two proposals are comparable. However in Sec. 4.6 the authors mention that in practice they sample multiple times and average the diffused fields to get the final performance. Depending on how many samples are drawn it will have an impact on the runtime making it grow significantly. From the current paper it is unclear if this multiple sampling strategy is used in the experimental validation ro only in Appendix C.2 and whether the inference time of Tab.5 are taking this into account or not. If not (as it seems like from the text) the inference cost will be significantly higher than competitors.\n\nc) **More ablation studies and unclear dependency on the initialization**: the core of the work is the use of a diffusion model to refine an initial estimation of a matching field ($F_{init}$). From the paper it is unclear how much the prior is able to recover in case of a bad initialization or not and whatever, if possible, the model will need more diffusion steps to recover from a bad conditioning. I would have liked these aspects to be discussed as part of the ablation study. Another interesting ablation that would have nicely complemented the work would have been using the dense cost volume as conditioning to the diffusion process.

While conventional techniques focused on defining hand-designed prior terms, which are difficult to formulate, re- cent approaches have focused on learning the data term with deep neural networks without explicitly modeling the prior, assuming that the model itself has the capacity to learn an optimal prior from a large-scale dataset. The performance improvement was obvious, however, they often fail to address inherent ambiguities of matching, such as textureless regions, repetitive patterns, large displacements, or noises. To address this, we propose DiffMatch, a novel conditional diffusion-based framework designed to explicitly model both the data and prior terms for dense matching. This is accomplished by leveraging a conditional denoising diffusion model that explic- itly takes matching cost and injects the prior within generative process. However, limited input resolution of the diffusion model is a major hindrance.

Without interventions, these biases could propagate a skewed worldview and restrict opportunities for minority groups. In this work, we frame fairness as a distributional alignment problem. Our solution consists of two main technical contributions: (1) a distributional alignment loss that steers specific characteristics of the generated images towards a user-defined target distribution, and (2) adjusted direct finetuning of diffusion model's sampling process (adjusted DFT), which leverages an adjusted gradient to directly optimize losses defined on the generated images. Empirically, our method markedly reduces gender, racial, and their intersectional biases for occupational prompts. Gender bias is significantly reduced even when finetuning just five soft tokens. Crucially, our method supports diverse perspectives of fairness beyond absolute equality, which is demonstrated by controlling age to a 75% young and 25% old distribution while simultaneously debiasing gender and race. Finally, our method is scalable: it can debias multiple concepts at once by simply including these prompts in the finetuning data.

Mistakenly identifying other regions as faces can lead to incorrect application of the distributional alignment loss and result in erroneous edits. Therefore, we use a relatively high detection threshold for the face detector. The failure to recognize faces is less problematic. It means some faces might not be considered in our fairness objective. To reduce the frequency of this oversight, we use two different face detectors, the face_recognition [2] and the insightface [3] packages.\n\nWe do not require the face classifiers to be highly accurate, such as over 95%. In our experiments, the gender classifier has 98% validation accuracy, the race classifier has 86% validation accuracy, and the age classifier has 90% validation accuracy. A few points are worth noting. Firstly, predicting certain attributes like race and age from visual cues can be inherently challenging. Secondly, the Distributional Alignment Loss (DAL) actually steers images towards those for which the classifier shows high confidence in distinguishing between male and female.  These high-confidence classifications can still provide a reliable visual guidance of gender, even when the classifier might have lower accuracy for the low-confidence classifications.\n\n***References***\n\n[1] Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt, and Arvind Narayanan, Fairness and Machine Learning: Limitations and Opportunities, 2023, https://fairmlbook.org\n\n[2] https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition\n\n[3] https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface\n\n---\n\nFinally, we note that many other improvements have been made in the revised paper.

We respond below to your questions and concerns:\n\n***W1: This paper kind of mixing fairness and bias and uses both terms interchangeably, especially for the experiment evaluation part, they define the metric for bias by themself which reduces the credential of the evaluation. I wonder if any other metrics from other research papers have been used for evaluation. Is it possible to use well-defined fairness metrics like demographic parity/ equal opportunity, etc?***\n\nWe apologize for the confusion arising from our uncareful use of the terms fairness and bias. They indeed have different meanings in our paper. We consider fairness as the distributional alignment with a user-defined target distribution, a flexible notion. Since our main experiments use a perfectly balanced target distribution, we define the metric bias to measure how far the generated images are from the perfectly balanced target distribution. When evaluating fairness for age, where we consider 75% young and 25% old as the target distribution, we directly report the percentage of age=old. We added clarification in the second paragraph  of section 5.1, highlighted in blue.\n\nWe note that demographic parity (DP) and equal opportunity (EO) are defined for prediction problems, where every individual has a protected attribute $S$, a true label $Y$, and a prediction $\\hat{Y}$ (chapter 3 of [1]). For T2I generative models, every generated image has only a protected attribute $S$. Therefore, DP and EO do not exactly apply here. In a way, the fairness problem in T2I generative models is simpler than that in prediction problems. Our objective is simply to control the generated imagesâ marginal distribution in terms of $S$ towards a target distribution.\n\nWe understand the reviewer has concern over whether the bias metric is truthful. In response, we have added plots of gender and racial representations by each prompt in Appendix Fig. A.2, A.3, A.4, and A.5, specifically at page15 & 16. These results provide a more detailed analysis than those presented in Tab. 1. \n\n\n***Q1: for the equation 4, what is the u?***\n\nWe have significantly revised Section 4.1 to enhance the clarity of our presentation. Eq. 4 in the initial paper corresponds to Eq. 4 and 5 in the updated paper. $\\\\{\\boldsymbol{u}_1,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{u}_N\\\\}$ are $N$ iid samples drawn from the target distribution $\\mathcal{D}$. Say we use the one-hot vectors [0,1] and [1,0] to denote male and female, and consider a balanced target distribution over these two classes. Then approximately half of $\\\\{\\boldsymbol{u}_1,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{u}_N\\\\}$ will be the vector [0,1] and the other half will be [1,0]. We construct $\\\\{\\boldsymbol{u}_1,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{u}_N\\\\}$ in this way so that it represents the target distribution and the optimal transport finds the most efficient modification of the current images towards the target distribution.\n\n \n***Q2: As for the alignment loss, have you tried some other metrics other than the optimal transport loss? And why did you choose the optimal transport metric?***\n\nWe naturally arrived at the optimal transport (OT) formulation and didnât experiment with other losses. We start by considering the following problem: suppose we have a set of 10 images, composed of 2 female and 8 male images, and our goal is to reconfigure this set to contain an equal number of female and male images, specifically 5 of each. The key question is determining which gender class every image should be reconfigured to. Additionally, it is essential to minimise alterations to the images when striving to attain an equal distribution of 5 female and 5 male images. This is naturally the OT (or linear assignment) problem, identifying which class every image should be transported to while minimising the transport distance. Finally, the OT problem considered here is low dimensional (2 for gender, 4 for race, and 8 for gender$\\times$race) and therefore efficient to solve.\n\nWe sample $\\\\{\\boldsymbol{u}_1,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{u}_N\\\\}$ from the target distribution and compute the expectation of OT because it (1) acknowledges even a perfectly balanced distribution can still produce unbalanced finite samples, (2) takes into account the sensitivity of OT, and (3) produce a confidence measure for the target class assignment.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer qhuJ (2/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': '`Response [2/2]`\n\n***Q6: The optimal transport approach in Eq. (4) was a bit confusing to me at first because it differs from the usual setting in which the optimal transport scheme between two distributions is considered. By contrast, the authors consider an expectation over the optimal transport schemes between two vectors here. I believe everything is actually described correctly, but maybe there is a way to make this section even easier / more intuitive for readers to grasp? (Sorry, possibly not very helpful.)***\n\nYour observation is correct: we consider the optimal transport (OT), or the linear assignment problem, between two sets of vectors here, followed by computing the expectation of OT w.r.t. randomness of the target set of vectors $\\\\{\\boldsymbol{u}\\_1,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{u}\\_N\\\\}$. We are particularly grateful that you pointing out our presentation of Equation 4 was not clear. We have thoroughly revised Section 4.1 to enhance its clarity. Eq. (4) in the initial paper corresponds to Eq. (4) and (5) in the revised paper.\n\n\n***Q7: It is a little bit confusing that y denotes both the generated target labels (normal font) as well as the images generated by the frozen model (boldface).***\n\nWe have changed $\\boldsymbol{y}^{(i)}$ to $\\boldsymbol{o}^{(i)}$ to denote the original images generated by the frozen model.\n\n\n***Q8: What does it mean that CLIP-ViT-bigG-14 and DINOv2 vit-g/14 are ""more performative than the ones used in training""?***\n\nBy âmore performativeâ, we meant the CLIP-ViT-bigG-14 used in evaluation has higher ImageNet zero-shot acc than the CLIP ViT-H/14 used in training. Similarly, the DINOv2 vit-g/14 used in evaluation also has higher ImageNet zero-shot acc than the dinov2-vit-b/14 used in training. In the revised paper, we have removed this sentence due to its lack of clarity.\n\n***Q9: The authors might want to consider citing Lester et al. regarding soft prompt tuning?***\n\nThank you for highlighting relevant previous research on soft prompt tuning.

We have diligently incorporated the suggestions from all reviewers into the revised paper. We respond below to your questions and concerns:\n\n***Q1: CLIP is not without its own issues; see e.g. Shtedritski et al., Wang et al., Wolfe et al., or Zhang and RÃ©. Could the authors discuss how this might affect the efficacy of their proposed method?***\n\nThank you for pointing out our oversight regarding CLIP\'s own biases. We added acknowledgement in Section 4.1, page 4, highlighted in blue. We did not observe significant negative impact on our debiasing method arising from CLIP and DINOâs own social impacts.  But we did observe DINOâs ViT architecture that splits an image into fixed-size patches can cause faces to appear rectangular in finetuning during our initial experiments. This observation is one of the factors that led us to use both CLIP and DINO. \n\nThe inherent image-image biases of CLIP and DINO, as opposed to text-image biases, could potentially affect our debiasing methods, given that we use CLIP and DINO to minimize image-image similarities. These biases might vary from the text-image biases documented in Shtedritski et al. [1], Wang et al. [2], Wolfe et al. [3], and Zhang and RÃ© [4]. We hypothesise that CLIP could be more biased than DINO in our context because CLIP is trained with text supervision while DINO is trained using image self-supervision. CLIP\'s training process, which aligns image features with text captions, is likely to introduce social biases. Our use of both CLIP and DINO might help mitigate the impact of these biases from CLIP.\n\n\n***Q2: How do the authors implement using different lambda values for different regions of the same image, as they describe at the end of section 4.1? (""We use a smaller weight for the non-face region ... and the smallest weight for the face region."") L_img is per image, not per pixel, no?***\n\n$\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\textrm{img}}$ can differ between the detected face region and non-face region in the same image, and therefore is per pixel. We implement $\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\textrm{img}}$  by adding a gradient manipulation layer right before inputting the generated image $\\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)}$ to CLIP & DINO. By scaling the gradients at the level of the generated image $\\boldsymbol{x}^{(i)}$, we can effectively implement a per-pixel $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textrm{img}}$.\n\n\n***Q3: I was confused about the training of the gender and race classifiers for the evaluation. Were separate classifiers trained for the training and the evaluation stage? If yes, why? â¦***\n\nWe trained separate gender and race classifiers for evaluation. We trained them for twice longer iterations, using the same architecture and training data. We do so in an effort to make the evaluation fairer. The debiasing method should not overfit to the classifier used during training and generates images that the training classifier views as fair but not the separately trained evaluation classifier. We added clarification in the revised paper.\n\n\n***Q4: It was unclear to me which of (soft prompt, text encoder, U-Net) were actually finetuned for all of the main experiments in section 5.1?***\n\nFor all of the main experiments, except explicitly stated otherwise, we finetune a LoRA adaptor with rank 50 applied on the text encoder. We added clarification in the first paragraph of Section 5.1, page 6, in the revised paper.  \n\n***Q5: Can the authors think of (and comment on) any drawbacks of applying their method at scale and for many fairness-relevant properties simultaneously? Could there be any negative consequences (e.g., in terms of image quality or biases) when e.g. generating very different images (bears, tables, groups of people, ... )? Recent observations by Qi et al. could also be interesting to discuss in this regard.***\n\nThank you for pointing us to consider the potential negative impacts of our debiasing finetuning. In response, we added an evaluation and discussion of the debiased SDâ generations for general prompts in Appendix page 17-22. We identify the debiased SD can occasionally and to a mild extent decrease the naturalness and smoothness of the generated images. Additionally, there are limitations in the generalizability of the debiasing effect. As illustrated in Figure A.11 on page 23, for the prompt ""A beautiful painting of woman by Mandy Jurgens, Trending on artstation"", the debiased SD increases the representation of Asian women, but does not similarly enhance the representation of Black and Indian women. We refer the reviewer to the more detailed discussion at Appendix Section A.5, specifically at page 14 & 17, highlighted in blue.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer T8Ls (2/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': '`Response [2/2]`\n\n***Q2: In Table 2, on unseen prompts, how good is the proposed method compared with the baselines?

We generally do not find overfitting, as demonstrated by the additional evaluation on general prompts (Appendix Section A.5, page 14 & 17~22). We did identify some negative impacts on image quality for the debiased SD, including occasional reduced naturalness and smoothness in the generated images. We discuss these in Appendix page 14 & 17, highlighted in blue.\n\n---\n\nFinally, we note that many other improvements have been made in the revised paper.

We respond below to your questions and concerns:\n\n***W1: The paper only tested the method on single-face generation, limiting the applicability of the proposed method.***\n\nWe have updated our manuscript accordingly. (1) We\'ve included an evaluation of multi-face generation in Table 3, page 7, highlighted in blue. The results show that the debiasing effect generalizes to images with multiple faces. (2) This evaluation also includes a bias metric calculated for all faces in the generated images, corroborating the original bias metric calculated using the most prominent face in each generated image. (3) Examples of generated images with multiple faces are shown in Appendix Figure A.13 & A.14, at page 29 & 30.\n\nWe have also considered directly debiasing all faces in generated images but find it is more appropriate to focus on debiasing the most prominent face in each image. This is because there may be legitimate correlations among individuals within the same image, and those at the forefront should not be simply equated with those in the background. As a result, defining an ideal fair outcome for all faces in the generated images is a more intricate task. But technically, our method is capable of directly debiasing all faces in the generated images.\n\n\n***W2: It is unclear whether fine-tuning with the fairness loss affects the quality and diversity of the generated images on general prompts.***\n\nWe have incorporated an evaluation of general prompts in the revised paper, on Appendix Section A.5, page 14 & 17~22. In short, the quality of the generated images remains largely unchanged but we do identify occasional and relatively minor reduction in naturalness and smoothness of the generated images. We observed no reduction in diversity of the generated images in general. We observed increased diversity for the prompt âbeautiful painting of a woman by Mandy Jurgens, trending on ArtStationâ, even though the model was debiased for templated occupational prompts and never for the term ""woman"". We refer the reviewer to the more detailed discussion at Appendix page 14 & 17, highlighted in blue. It analyzes the quality, diversity, and fairness of images generated from general prompts. \n\n\n***W3: Although experiments in the paper show better performance than baseline methods, it is unclear how expensive the fine-tuning is compared with the baseline methods.***\n\nDebiasing SD may require a one-time training cost or additional compute at every inference time. Our fine-tuning method generally requires more training compute than baselines. But it effectively scales to a large number of prompts and does not incur additional inference compute. In the second paragraph of the introduction (highlighted in blue), we recognized existing methods are more lightweight.\n\nIn terms of specific comparisons, Ethical Intervention is a prompting method and does not incur additional training or inference compute.  Based on our experiments, DebiasVL requires around 1 GPU-hour (using an A100) training. UCE requires around 24 GPU-hours to debias 50 prompts. But we find the required compute time increases drastically when we increase the number of prompts. Concept Algebra does not require training but doubles the inference cost, which can be undesirable. Our method requires 8 GPUs * 48 hours for debiasing 1000 prompts but does not increase inference compute.\n\nWe have included the training losses plot in Appendix Figure A.1, page 14. This plot indicates that although we train for 10k iterations for best performance, the finetuning achieves debiasing quite early, within 1k iterations, and can potentially be early stopped at 5k iterations. Therefore, the computational requirements for our method might not be as extensive as reported.\n\n\n***Q1: In Equation (4), how to obtain the expectation in practice?***\n\nWe have significantly revised Section 4.1 to improve its clarity. Eq. 4 in the initial paper corresponds to Eq. 4 and 5 in the revised paper. In general, the expectation is approximated by repeatedly drawing $\\\\{\\boldsymbol{u}\\_1,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{u}\\_N\\\\}$ from the target distribution $\\mathcal{D}^{N}$, computing the optimal transport from $\\\\{\\boldsymbol{p}\\_1,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{p}\\_N\\\\}$ to $\\\\{\\boldsymbol{u}\\_1,\\cdots,\\boldsymbol{u}\\_N\\\\}$, and computing the average of these OTs. When the number of classes $K$ as well as $N$ is small, we can enumerate all possible samples from $\\mathcal{D}^{N}$, compute OT for all of them, and analytically compute the expectation by weighing different OTs according to the target distribution.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'To all reviewers: we uploaded a revised version of the paper'}, 'comment': {'value': ""We sincerely thank all reviewers for their insightful and constructive feedback.

This scenario is formulated as Evolving Domain Generalization (EDG), where models aim to generalize well to unseen target domains in a time-varying system by learning and leveraging the underlying evolving pattern of the distribution shifts across domains. However, existing methods encounter challenges due to the limited number of timestamps (every domain corresponds to a timestamp) in EDG datasets, leading to difficulties in capturing evolving dynamics and risking overfitting to the sparse timestamps, which hampers their generalization and adaptability to new tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach SDE-EDG that collects the Infinitely Fined-Grid Evolving Trajectory (IFGET) of the data distribution with continuous-interpolated samples to bridge temporal gaps (intervals between two successive timestamps). Furthermore, by leveraging the inherent capacity of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to capture continuous trajectories, we propose their use to align SDE-modeled trajectories with IFGET across domains, thus enabling the capture of evolving distribution trends. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it can achieve superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.",Oral 5C,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=bTMMNT7IdW,https://openreview.net/forum?id=bTMMNT7IdW,bTMMNT7IdW,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'Evolving domain generalization (EDG) is an important problem because the distribution changes over time in many scenarios.

I understand neural SDEs that neural SDEs do not rely on the assumption of the model being uni-modal, in contrast to prevelant uni-modal Gaussian distributions. However, most deep learning methods assume the classification tasks to exhibit uni-modal characteristics through using ERM classifi cation loss. Therefore, I am wondering whether uni-modal or multi-modal classification loss contributes to the accuracy improvement of SDE-EDG in EDG.\n\nA5. We conduct the experiments with uni-modal and multi-modal classification loss respectively. The results reveal that the performance of the uni-modal approach closely resembled that of the multi-modal. The choice between the modalities often hinges upon the inherent characteristics of the datasets themselves. In real-world applications, employing cross-validation can be applied to determine the most suitable method to a specific dataset.\n\n|       Datasets |RMNIST    |Portrait       | PowerSupply     \n|:-------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|\n|Uni|52.4 | 89.6 | 75.7|\n|Multi|52.6|88.9|75.1\n\nWe have added this experimental result to our appendix.\n\n> Q. The computational costs of Neural SDEs, particularly regarding backward gradient propagation, are relatively high. However, this paper does not provide discussions of this aspect.\n\nA. We appreciate the thoughtful comments. The computational efficiency of the Vanilla SDE method can be time-consuming, but our implementation utilizing the ""torchsde"" package, as in [1], significantly saves computational resources. According to [1], the computational complexity of the neural SDE component in the SDE-EDG method is characterized by $\\mathcal{O}\\Big((M+L) D\\Big)$, where $M$ is the number of source domains, $L$ is the number of target domains, and $D$ accounts for the number of parameters within the drift and diffusion neural networks.\n\nRegarding the backward gradient propagation, ""torchsde"" leverages the adjoint method for gradient computation, for which an exact time complexity analysis is unavailable in literature to the best of our knowledge. We conduct experiments and record the runtime per iteration during the training phase. The below results indicate that SDE-EDG is not the fastest computational time among the considered methods. However, it\'s noted that SDE-EDG consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of at least 11.6% across all datasets.\n\n\n\n\n|       Algos |DDA    |GI       | SDE-EDG     \n|:-------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|\n|RMNIST|0.19s | 2.80s | 0.27s|\n|Portrait|0.77s|7.48s|0.31s\n\n>Typos\n\nThanks.

We now address your concerns.\n\n>W1. I doubt the existence of evolving dynamics. It's worth considering scenarios where time-related tasks might lack evolving patterns and instead exhibit random shifts.\n\nA1. We appreciate the thoughtful comments.  In cases where evolving dynamics aren't present, it aligns with the traditional Domain Generalization problem that's extensively discussed and explored in existing literature [1]. On the other hand, numerous real-world applications exhibit evolving dynamics. For instance: i) An ocular disease detection system requires an acquisition of evolving patterns across different ages to accurately predict outcomes for elder patients. ii) Self-driving systems contend with latent factors that shift over time, encompassing seasonal changes, varying weather conditions, and alterations in street environments. iii) Recommendation systems employed in fashion retail, where sales are influenced by temporal factors such as trends, weather, seasons, and more. This demonstrates that latent evolving patterns are pervasive in real-world scenarios.\n\n>W2. Linear interpolations may not reflect the true evolving trajectories, since the real evolving trajectories might be nonlinear and complex.\n\nA2. Yes, there are approximating errors between the linear interpolations and real samples. To mitigate such issues,\nthe interpolation rate $\\lambda$ is drawn from the Beta distribution. By setting $\\beta_1,\\beta_2<1$ for the Beta-distributed $\\lambda\\sim\\mathcal{B}(\\beta_1,\\beta_2)$, $\\lambda$ tends to approach either $0$ or $1$. When $\\lambda\\rightarrow 1$, linear interpolation can be viewed as a first-order Taylor expansion around $\\small(m+1)$ here\n$$\\hat{z}=(1-\\lambda) z_{m}+\\lambda z_{m+1}=z_{m+1} +[(m+\\lambda)-(m+1)]\\frac{z_{m+1}-z_{m}}{(m+1)-m}\\approx z_{m+1}+(1-\\lambda) f'(m+1)$$\nwhere $z_m$ is parametrized by a function $f(m)$, $\\frac{z_{m+1}-z_{m}}{(m+1)-m}$ approximates the first-order derivative. The aim is to minimize error by sampling $\\lambda$ such that it approaches $1$, causing $(1-\\lambda)$ to approach $0$. Conversely, if we expand around $m$, we tend to sample $\\lambda$ closer to $0$ to minimize the approximation error. Overall, the approximating errors remain tolerable, as the interpolations show capabilities of improving learning evolving patterns and enhancing performance. Using mixup [2] as an example, an interpolation generated through a weighted sum of two samples from distinct domains doesn't exist in the real world. Despite this, it facilitates learning and functions effectively as a regularizer.\n\n>W3.  Considering that IFGET is an approximation, and the existence of ground truth sample-to-sample correspondence is uncertain, how do we guarantee that IFGET accurately represents the real evolving trajectories?\n\nA3. The existence of evolving dynamics is normally decided by prior knowledge or expert knowledge. The ground truth sample-to-sample correspondence might not exist in the collected datasets, but the efficacy of IFGET learning is validated by its contribution to the acquisition of evolving representations, as demonstrated by Figure 2 and Figure 3 (d). For instance, in datasets such as the Ocular Disease dataset, where images of the same individual at different ages might be absent, we can search the possible sample by leveraging similar features existing in behaviors or symptoms. This enables the approximation of complete latent evolving trajectories effectively, filling in the absence left in the evolving path. \n\nOn the other hand, the linear interpolation, being a first-order Taylor expansion, introduces approximation errors sailing as $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)$, an error that remains tolerable. Furthermore, we have computed the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the interpolations and the real samples on the Sine dataset in the table below. Using the identity function as the backbone, this table demonstrates that the approximation error remains relatively low.\n\nDomain Interval |$(0,\\frac{\\pi}{24}]$    |$(\\frac{\\pi}{24},\\frac{\\pi}{12}]$|$(\\frac{\\pi}{12},\\frac{\\pi}{8}]$|$(\\frac{\\pi}{8},\\frac{\\pi}{6}]$|$(\\frac{\\pi}{6},\\frac{5\\pi}{24}]$|$(\\frac{5\\pi}{24},\\frac{\\pi}{4}]$  |$(\\frac{\\pi}{4},\\frac{7\\pi}{24}]$           |$(\\frac{7\\pi}{24},\\frac{\\pi}{3}]$           |$(\\frac{\\pi}{3},\\frac{3\\pi}{8}]$           |$(\\frac{3\\pi}{8},\\frac{5\\pi}{12}]$           |$(\\frac{5\\pi}{12},\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$           |\n|:-------:|:-------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|\n|MSE|0.352|0.401|0.125|0.210|0.302|0.148|0.136|0.167|0.195|0.371|0.531|""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Rebuttal from Authors of Paper2147 to Reviewer y1vq (2/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': '>Q4.

We now address your concerns.\n\n> W. The illustration of continuous-interpolated samples is not very clear. I am a little bit confused about why the samples generated with the linear interpolation method are called ""continuous"".\n\nA. We call it ""continuous"" because: For each interpolation, $\\hat{z}=(1-\\lambda)z_m+\\lambda z_{m+1}$, $\\lambda$ is sampled from a Beta distribution. Thus, $\\lambda$ is expected to be any value between $(0,1)$ with possibility and hence it allow us to approximate any time moment between the $m$-th and $(m+1)$-th timestamps. We have made it clearer in the revisions (above Section 4.2). \n\n> Q1. What are the differences between continuous-interpolated samples and samples used in previous works?\n\nA1. Previous works use samples from a limited number ($M$) of source domains to train the temporal model (using LSTM [1] or temporal transition model [2]), potentially leading to overfitting issues. To tackle this issue, we propose the use of interpolated samples, creating a finer-grid latent trajectory, which facilitates the learning of evolving patterns.\n\n>Q2. From my perspective, the interpolated samples are generated discretely. Thus, does the SDE-EDG method approximates the continuous case in the way of discretely sampling?\n\nA2. Yes. As mentioned in (A) above, given that the interpolation coefficient $\\lambda$ ranges between $0$ and $1$, we consider the possibility of sampling data from any timestamp within the interval $[0,T]$. This enables us to view the trajectory as continuous.\n\n>Q3. According to my understanding, Eq.(7) aims at learning a set of parameters for $f_k$ and $g_k$ so that the learned model can mimic the approximated trajectory of data. In my opinion, such an operation relies heavily on the quality of data representations, especially at the early phase of training, since the feature extractor is not well trained yet. Thus, in such a case, will the linear interpolation result in some ""bad interpolation""?\n\nA3. We appreciate your valuable comments. During the initial training stage, the interpolation unavoidably might not be precise approximations. However, as the training goes on, the model is updated and the representations gradually converge to optimal representations. This training process involves mutual interactions: The IFGET acts as a regularizer, preserving evolving information within the representations, as illustrated in Figure 2 and Figures 3 (d-e); Simultaneously, the representations contained the evolving dynamics in turn facilitate the learning of $f_k$ and $g_k$.  In typical classification tasks, initial representations may not be optimal but are still utilized for training the classification head (often an MLP). Eventually, all components in SDE-EDG converge towards an optimum due to the benefits of the end-to-end training protocol.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Rebuttal from Authors of Paper2147 to Reviewer KuA7'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your time and valuable comments. We now address your concerns.\n\n>Q1. In one iteration, for two consecutive domains, only one interpolated sample is generated. Can more than one sample be generated and used? For example, we can first generate one interpolated sample via Eq.5 and then set this sample as $\\tilde{z}_{m+1}$ to generate the second sample. If so, how does this influence the performance?\n\n\n\nA1. Sorry for causing the misunderstanding.  We have clarified this in the Equation 5 of the revisions. In practice, we generate an interpolation for each sample pair within the sampled batch of size $N_B$, resulting in $N_B$ interpolations per iteration. \n\nInterpolating twice to generate the second sample is equivalent to generating the interpolation once. Specifically, if we denote the second sample resulting from interpolation twice as:\n\n$${\\hat z_{twice}}=( 1 - \\lambda_2) z_m+ \\lambda_2 {\\hat z_{m+1}} =(1-\\lambda_2)z_{m}+ \\lambda_2 [(1-\\lambda_1) z_m+\\lambda_1 z_{m+1}] =(1-\\lambda_1\\lambda_2)z_m+\\lambda_1\\lambda_2 z_{m+1}$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are two interpolation rates for the first and second interpolated samples.

How many interpolation points are generated between two consecutive data points, i.e., how many $\\lambda$ are drawn; am I right in assuming that only one is drawn? Would an increase in the number of intermediate points result in better performance?\n\nYes, we generate one interpolation in each training iteration and utilize a single $\\lambda$ to maintain computational efficiency through batch operations on CUDA. While employing interpolations helps mitigate overfitting, it\'s essential to find a balanced tradeoff. Increasing the number of interpolations may introduce accumulated approximation errors between interpolated and real samples, causing a decline in performance.

Neural SDEs are known to be very resource consuming. Can you assess the runtime complexity, for example?\n\nYes, Vanilla SDE can be time-consuming.

According to [1], the computational complexity of the neural SDE component in SDE-EDG method is $\\mathcal{O}\\Big((M+L) D\\Big)$, where $M$ is the number of source domains, $L$ is the number of target domains, and $D$ is the number of parameters of the drift and diffusion neural networks. \n\nWe conduct experiments and record the runtime per iteration during the training phase. The below results indicate that SDE-EDG is comparable among the considered methods, and both our SDE-EDG and DDA are much faster than GI.

The IFGET module reminds me on a approach by Kidger et al. 2020 (Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Irregular Time Series) in which the authors also try to improve the learning of latent trajectories by including interpolated sample trajectories, in their terms a ""controlled pathâ. This is done in the ODE setting, but can be integrated into the SDE setting if the approach is applied to learning the drift coefficient. Can you explain in more detail how your approach differs?\n\nA3.  We highlight distinctions between [6] and our approach SDE-EDG in four aspects. \n\n1. Interpolation is applied for different purposes: [6] aims to obtain gradients via interpolations, but we aim to obtain augmentations from unseen timestamps. More specifically, [6] employing a spline method to approximate the trajectories of $X$, and computing gradients from the derivative of the spline function. In contrast, SDE-EDG utilizes interpolations as augmentations to enhance the learning of latent trajectories, aiming to mitigate overfitting to limited timestamps.\n\n2. Different problem scope: [6] focuses on predicting the labels $Y$ based on the whole time series $( X_1,\\ldots,X_M)$, which is a time-series classification task. Conversely, in EDG setup, SDE-EDG aims to utilize latent temporal patterns learned from $\\(X_t,Y_t)$, $t=1,\\ldots,M$ collected from the seen timestamps to improve predictions of $Y$ based on observations of $X$ in future timestamps.\n\n3. Interpolate in different spaces: [6] utilizes interpolation on $X$ within the original space, whereas SDE-EDG employs interpolation on $Z$ within the latent space. The choice of interpolating $Z$ offers potential advantages in capturing the underlying evolving dynamics of the data generation process compared to the original observations $X$.\n\n4. We adopt different interpolation techniques: SDE-EDG uses direct linear interpolation to reduce time computational complexity, while [6] employs cubic spline interpolations.\n\nAdditionally, our novelty doesn\'t lie in the interpolation method itself; rather, it lies in addressing overfitting to sparse timestamps through interpolations and effectively capturing evolving dynamics by constructing IFGET under EDG settings.\n\n>Q1. (p.3) Do you assume all source domains have the same sample size $N$ or can it vary? \n\nA1. For simplicity in notation, we use the same symbol $N$ for source domains. Empirically, this value can actually vary in each domain. In other words, we do not assume the same sample size $N$ in our algorithm implementation.\n\n>Q2. (p.4) You repeat here (unnecessarily, in my opinion) the argument of ""sample complexity"", which already appeared on p. 1. However, I would like to ask if you could explain this argument in more detail?\n\nA2. Thanks for your valuable feedback. We have deleted this sentence in Section 4.1 in revisions. We use the sample complexity as a support to our motivation. The sample complexity, with a smaller number of timestamps $M$, leads to **a looser generalization bound**, showed by the complexity term $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{1/M})$. This indicates that **overfitting occurs when the model learns from a limited number of timestamps**. In light of this, our proposed IFGET involves interpolation between timestamps to generate approximations that act as augmentation from different unseen intermediate timestamps. \n\n>Q3. (p.4) Can you define $N_B$?\n\nA3. $N_B$ denotes the number of samples for a batch in a training iteration. We define it below the Equation 4.\n\n> Q4. (p.4) Why do you choose to draw the interpolation rate $\\lambda$ from a Beta distribution?\n\nA4. Beta-distribution is verified for linear interpolation in literature [8, 9]. In SDE-EDG, $\\lambda$ thereby will have higher chances to be close to either $0$ or $1$ by sampling from Beta distribution, leading to a more accurate approximation. By choosing $\\beta_1,\\beta_2<1$ of Beta-distribution $\\lambda\\sim\\mathcal{B}(\\beta_1,\\beta_2)$, $\\lambda$ is closer to $0$ or $1$. When $\\lambda\\rightarrow 1$, we can regard linear interpolation as the first order Taylor expansion at $\\small(m+1)$ here\n$$\\hat{z}=(1-\\lambda) z_{m}+\\lambda z_{m+1}=z_{m+1} +[(m+\\lambda)-(m+1)]\\frac{z_{m+1}-z_{m}}{(m+1)-m}\\approx z_{m+1}+(1-\\lambda) f\'(m+1)$$\nwhere $z_m$ is parametrized by a function $f(m)$,  $\\frac{z_{m+1}-z_{m}}{(m+1)-m}$ approximates the first-order derivative. Since it is an approximation, we aim to reduce the approximation error by sampling $\\lambda\\rightarrow 1$ and thus $(1-\\lambda)\\rightarrow 0$. On the other hand, if we expand on $m$, we tend to sample $\\lambda$ closer to $0$ to minimize the approximation error.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Rebuttal from Authors of Paper2147 to Reviewer bSwA (1/3)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your time and valuable feedback. We now address your concerns.\n\n> W1. Learning neural SDEs is traditionally successfully presented in the framework of variational Bayesian inference (e.g. Li et al. 2020), where stochastic gradient descent methods are applied to minimize the evidence lower bound (ELBO). I wonder why the authors do not clearly address the reference to variational Inference in the manuscript, especially since the indications (e.g., the graphical model in Figure 1, derivation of the likelihood loss of IFGET in Lemma B.1) are given.\n\nA1. Thank you for your insightful comments. We admit in SDE models, variational inference is commonly employed, allowing the assumption of a prior distribution for the diffusion term, such as the OrnsteinâUhlenbec (OU) process or Wiener process. This serves as a regularization technique, mitigating overfitting by regularizing the diffusion term. We also highlighted this in the final line of page 2 within Section 2 (Related Works) and we revised the last sentence of Section 2 to stress this point.\n\nOn the other hand, we also note that variational inference is not a mandatory requirement for optimizing SDE models [2, 3, 4]. Maximum likelihood, a widely used method, is also applicable for optimizing SDEs [2, 4]. In SDE-EDG method, we indeed adopted maximum likelihood rather than variational inference. \n\nThe graphical models depicted in Figure 1 of our paper and Figure 4 in [1] serve similar purposes. Their roles are not related to variational inference but rather illustrate the generative process of the data. Lemma B.1 also shows the derivation of maximum likelihood, not the ELBO in variational inference.\n\n>W2. The Sine experiment (Figure 3) is arguably a rather simple problem from a dynamic point of view and yet already indicates the limited extrapolation quality of the approach. Of course, this reduces my confidence in the generalization ability of the approach. I suspect possible causes in (i) unfavorable modeling of drift and diffusion coefficients and (ii) that the linear interpolation approach in the IFGET module is too coarse. Can you comment on this?\n\nA2. We appreciate the valuable comment. The cause is not modeling or interpolation method, but the EDG setup of the Sine dataset in our experiments making the task very challenging. We follow the setup of LSSAE [5], where we divide a complete sine $[0,2\\pi]$ into 24 domains, each spanning $\\frac{\\pi}{12}$. Most importantly, sine in EDG experiments only has 12 domains $[0,\\pi)$ for training, $[\\pi, \\frac{4\\pi}{3})$ for validation, $[\\frac{4\\pi}{3},2\\pi]$ for reporting test results. This means we train the model using only half of the sine instead of the entire period of the sine curve, which makes the task significantly more challenging. \n\nFrom Table 6 in the appendix, the results of Sine show that under this setting, none of the methods can generalize well to unseen domains, especially when the test domains are far away from the training domains. However, our method SDE-EDG shows performance improvement by 0.8% compared to the best baseline.\n\nIn Figure 3(d), where we illustrate the latent paths learned by the SDE component, we set the backbone as the identity function and the hidden dimension to $2$ for better visualization compared to the original Sine. However, for the experiments reported in Table 1, we apply a hidden dimension of $32$, as indicated in Table 12 of the appendix. This leads to better fitting capabilities and better generalization than what Figure 3(d) displays especially for the test domains that are close to the training domains.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'The present work proposes SDE-EDG, a novel learning approach for solving the problem of Evolving Domain Generalization in the context of (neural) Stochastic Differential Equations.

But are we making the best use of data? How more economical can we be? In this work, we attempt to answer this question by making two contributions. First, we investigate first-person videos and introduce a Walking Tours'' dataset. These videos are high-resolution, hours-long, captured in a single uninterrupted take, depicting a large number of objects and actions with natural scene transitions. They are unlabeled and uncurated, thus realistic for self-supervision and comparable with human learning. Second, we introduce a novel self-supervised image pretraining method tailored for learning from continuous videos. Existing methods typically adapt image-based pretraining approaches to incorporate more frames. Instead, we advocate a tracking to learn to recognize'' approach. Our method called DoRA, leads to attention maps that D isc O ver and t RA ck objects over time in an end-to-end manner, using transformer cross-attention. We derive multiple views from the tracks and use them in a classical self-supervised distillation loss. Using our novel approach, a single Walking Tours video remarkably becomes a strong competitor to ImageNet for several image and video downstream tasks.",Oral 5D,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Yen1lGns2o,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yen1lGns2o,Yen1lGns2o,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'The paper presents a self-supervised setting on egocentric videos and introduces an egocentric video dataset to demonstrate its use cases.

Stability of SK**  \n\nSK is an iterative optimization algorithm that indeed converges, with its cost function monotonically decreasing with the number of iterations.\n\nWe understand that the reviewer asks about training stability when using SK---if not, please clarify. We empirically find that, when using SK with the features from the last layer of the transformer to compute refined object prototypes $P'$, training is indeed stable.\n\nUsing annealing to transform the coupling matrix from soft to hard might be needed if we target hard assignment between object prototypes and patch features. Hard assignment can also be achieved by using a smaller value of $\\epsilon$ (coefficient of entropy regularizer), which improves one-to-one matching, although it makes optimization harder. We evaluate the performance of DoRA with a smaller value of $\\epsilon$ and increasing the number of iterations to 60 (default iterations is 30), observing sub-optimal results on downstream tasks. This indicates that downstream task performance does not benefit from hard assignment.  \n\n**3. Overlapping attention maps.**  \n\nThe overlap of the attention maps obtained from different heads is commonly observed as there is no supervisory signal during training to ensure diverse attention from different heads. For example, see Fig. 10 of DINO (Appendix), where the authors show overlap for the different heads in the last layer.  \n\nIn our previous experiments, we used a simple heuristic inspired from CutLer [2*]. This is an unsupervised object discovery method that iteratively uses normalized cuts on patch affinity matrix to find foreground objects. Similarly, we iteratively removed attended regions to find more, non-overlapping ones. However, on WT videos, we observed that this heuristic did not achieve consistent improvements on all downstream tasks. In particular, its results were sub-optimal on linear probing on Imagenet and unsupervised object discovery on Pascal VOC.\n\n[2*] Wang *et al.*, Cut and Learn for Unsupervised Object Detection and Instance Segmentation, CVPR 2023.  \n\n**4.

Given this dataset contribution, the authors propose a self-supervised method which tracks objects to act as a signal for a classical multi-view self-supervised learning (SSL) loss. This method leverages some key properties from the dataset, specifically that the videos have natural scene transitions and are of a person-person view.

To pretrain on Walking Tours, the paper proposed a novel SSL method, based on DINO, to first discover objects and then track objects, named DoRA. In every batch, DoRA randomly sampled 8 frames temporally separated by 1 second, discovered objects in the first frame, and tracked them over the following 7 frames. In the default setting, objects are tracked by cross-attention in the multi-object tracker, which leads to spatially overlapping. The paper then proposed to establish object-patch correspondences using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to deal with the problem. After finding separated objects, the input video clip in the student branch would be masked to contrast with the clip in the teacher branch. Experiments on dense prediction tasks show that DoRA on Walking tours shows comparable performance with other SSL methods pretrained on ImageNet.'}, 'soundness': {'value': '4 excellent'}, 'presentation': {'value': '3 good'}, 'contribution': {'value': '3 good'}, 'strengths': {'value': '1.\tThis paper proposed a new pretraining method on egocentric videos which are uncurated and comparable with human learning.

Detecting this type of contamination is challenging because the pretraining data used by proprietary models are often not publicly accessible.We propose a procedure for detecting test set contamination of language models with exact false positive guarantees and without access to pretraining data or model weights. Our approach leverages the fact that when there is no data contamination, all orderings of an exchangeable benchmark should be equally likely. In contrast, the tendency for language models to memorize example order means that a contaminated language model will find certain canonical orderings to be much more likely than others. Our test flags potential contamination whenever the likelihood of a canonically ordered benchmark dataset is significantly higher than the likelihood after shuffling the examples.We demonstrate that our procedure is sensitive enough to reliably detect contamination in challenging situations, including models as small as 1.4 billion parameters, on small test sets only 1000 examples, and datasets that appear only a few times in the pretraining corpus. Finally, we evaluate LLaMA-2 to apply our test in a realistic setting and find our results to be consistent with existing contamination evaluations.",Oral 6B,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=KS8mIvetg2,https://openreview.net/forum?id=KS8mIvetg2,KS8mIvetg2,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'This paper studies the problem of identifying test set contamination in large language models, i.e., detecting that a test set is present in the pretraining data of a language model.

We consider contamination detection as the problem of detecting a statistical dependence between the test data and model parameters, and show that we can provide provable guarantees in the case of verbatim contamination, where the full test set (with examples and labels) is embedded in the pretraining data. Prior work is primarily heuristic in nature; To our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind to provide provable guarantees of contamination for language models. \n\nFor comparison against a baseline, we provide a comparison against a contamination detection method called Min-K% Prob, a state of the art heuristic method for contamination detection in language models proposed contemporaneous to our work by Shi et. al. (2023). \n\nWe find that our method matches or exceeds the performance of this state of the art heuristic method. Please see the table in the top-level comment for numbers. \n\nThank you for your question regarding the impact of model size on the performance of the test. Existing work on memorization in language models suggests that larger models memorize their training data more strongly. For example, Carlini et. al. (2023) show that both model size and repetitions in the training data increase the extractability of training data sequences. Our empirical results show that the power of our test increases dramatically in the number of repetitions (duplication rate), and we posit that our test enjoys a similar increase in power for larger model sizes, since larger models likely memorize example order more strongly.\n\nWe present preliminary results on the impact of model size on the power of our test. We evaluated three models of increasing parameter counts trained on the same data mixtures as in section 4.1, on the test sets present in the pretraining data at a duplication rate of 1. These results suggest that the test performs better with larger models.\n\n| Parameter Count | Average Logarithm of P-Value |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| 355M          | -1.427  |\n| 774M          | -1.825 |\n| 1500M          | -12.783  |'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for your thorough analysis and constructive feedback on our paper. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the points raised and to provide additional insights into our research.\n\nN-gram overlap is a commonly utilized measure of contamination in the literature; however, it should be noted that it acts more as a measurement tool rather than as a definition of contamination. N-gram overlap may fail to distinguish between coincidental overlap and genuine contamination in some situations, and has been observed to potentially lead to false positives under certain conditions. For example, the Stanford Question-Answering Dataset (SQuAD v2) uses background information derived from Wikipedia, and in the GPT-3 paper, Brown et. al. (2020) find high N-gram overlap for this reason, even if labels are not present in the data and no true contamination exists. Please see pg. 43 of that paper for examples of false positives in their contamination study. \n\nWe believe that the definition introduced in our paper, of contamination as a statistical dependence between the model and the dataset, is precise and formal, and better captures the notion of contamination as a transfer of information between the test set and the modelânot simply a correlation that appears because both the test set and pre-training data share information. \n\nWhile verbatim contamination of ordered data does not encompass all forms of contamination, we found that the presence of ordered test sets in pre-training data is surprisingly common. A search of The Pile, a large open-source language modeling dataset, yielded numerous instances of real-world datasets embedded with examples appearing in-order; see our top-level comment for an example. \n\nIn pre-training, shuffling of the data occurs at the document level, and is not typically applied to the data within a document. Files collected from the internet would typically be treated as singular documents in dataset construction pipelines. \n\nMore importantly, the use of ordering allows us to give provable guarantees of contamination, which is more difficult to achieve for other, less direct forms of contamination. Our work is the only existing contamination detection method for language models to give guarantees of this kind. \n\nRegarding concerns about sensitivity of the test to the shard count, figure 3 (left) shows that a wide range of shard counts (between 10 and 150) attain p-values below 1e-4. Once the p-value is low enough that statistical significance is attained, there is no added benefit to lowering the p-value. Therefore, the plot suggests that the test is robust to shard count, so long as the shard count is not too low (so that the t-test can still be used reasonably), and not too high (so that there are enough examples per shard to get sufficient signal from log-prob differences.)\n\nSimilarly, figure 3 (right) shows that increasing the permutation count monotonically decreases the p-value, and that the p-value stabilizes beyond about 25 permutations per shard. This suggests that the test is not sensitive to the permutation count, provided that the permutation count is not too low. Our empirical results use a permutation count of at least 50. We welcome further discussion on this point to ensure we fully understand and address your concerns.\n\nDetecting contamination at the instruction fine-tuning stage would be interesting follow-up work, but is complicated by the fact that examples are commonly shuffled in this setting, and so we cannot test against a known example order. In this setting, heuristic methods may prove to be more effective.\n\nWe hope this response has addressed your concerns effectively. We are grateful for the chance to discuss our work's potential, and wish to thank you again for your valuable input.""}}, {'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for your thorough review and valuable feedback on our work.\n\nWe'd like to address the concern regarding the computational complexity of our test. It's important to note that the test is a one-time process for any given model and dataset; once the p-values are computed, there is no need for recalculation. Our findings indicate that a number of permutations beyond 30-50 per shard offers diminishing returns, as shown in Figure 3 (right).\n\nFurthermore, the test's design allows for easy parallelization. Each shard permutation can be evaluated independently, enabling the use of inexpensive commodity hardware to run the test significantly faster.\n\nRegarding the assumption of data exchangeability, this is a strictly weaker condition than the commonly held assumption of independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.) data in machine learning. Most datasets satisfy this assumption to some extent.\n\nWe acknowledge the validity of our test hinges on data exchangeability. However, depending on the source of non-exchangeability, it is often the case that a dataset can be altered slightly so that our test is still valid. For example, a common source of non-exchangeability is the presence of ascending IDs (e.g. as in SQuAD and HumanEval). We can adjust the dataâby either removing these IDs or permuting the examples while keeping IDs constantâto retain the test's applicability. This is discussed in more detail in the revised paper.\n\nFinally, we appreciate your suggestion to include baseline comparisons. We provide a comparison against a contamination detection method called Min-K% Prob, a state of the art heuristic method for contamination detection in language models proposed contemporaneous to our work by Shi et. al.

Such a data selection step is useful to reduce the requirements of data labeling and the computational complexity of learning. We assume to be given N unlabeled samples $x_{i}$, and to be given access to a 'surrogate model' that can predict labels $y_i$ better than random guessing. Our goal is to select a subset of the samples, to be denoted by {$x_{i}$}$_{i\in G}$, of size $|G|=n < N$. We then acquire labels for this set and we use them to train a model via regularized empirical risk minimization. By using a mixture of numerical experiments on real and synthetic data, and mathematical derivations under low- and high- dimensional asymptotics, we show that: (i) Data selection can be very effective, in particular beating training on the full sample in some cases; (ii) Certain popular choices in data selection methods (e.g. unbiased reweighted subsampling, or influence function-based subsampling) can be substantially suboptimal.",Oral 6C,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HhfcNgQn6p,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HhfcNgQn6p,HhfcNgQn6p,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'The paper studies the problem of selecting a subsample of the data that can be used in an ERM framework.

However, it would be also understandable if this is left for a future work.'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""We thank the reviewer for their thorough and insightful feedback and questions. Below we summarize the responses to weaknesses and questions.\n\n**Imperfect surrogate.** It is not true that our analysis beyond Section 4 is limited to perfect surrogates.\n- The analysis summarized in Section 5 (and Appendix L) covers the general case in which the surrogate model is misaligned with the true model. The strength of the surrogate model is represented by the parameter $\\beta_s$ in Eq 5.2, where a perfect surrogate is a special case with $\\beta_0 =  || \\theta_0 || $. \n- We use this theory to study the effect of surrogate model misspecification in Figure 2 and estimation error in the surrogate model in Figure 7 (Appendix L). \n- Notice in particular that the panels in Figure 7 capture the qualitative behavior of Figure 1 (the âmagicâ effect) with comparable choices for sample size and dimension. We conclude that this theory provides a good starting point for understanding these effects.\n- We also point out that the analysis of imperfect surrogates summarized in Section 5 occupies the whole appendix K. \n\n**Theorem 1.** *This theorem is not about adversarial examples*, but random i.i.d. ones (âthere exists a distributionâ). Further, by inspection of the proof (Example G.2), the distribution is very simple and natural (as ânaturalâ as the Gaussian distribution). We simply take feature vectors $x_i$ that are generated as $x_i=r \\cdot u_i$, where $u_i$ is uniform on the sphere, and $r$ is a scalar that is independent of $u_i$ and has a power law tail. Gaussian with identity covariance does not work for this example because (informally) 'all Gaussian vectors look the same'. In a sense, this is what makes Gaussian data an unrealistic model in many applications: they have way less variability than real data.\n\n**Dimensionality of the parameter.** The theory of Section 4 accommodates for a number of parameters (indicated by $p$) different from the number of input dimensions ($d$). The theory of Section 5 assumes a generalized linear model, and therefore $p=d$.\n\n**Explaining Figure 1.** The experiment settings of the Figure 1 that you described are correct. The test accuracy of the weak (strong) surrogate model is 87% (91%). Weaker models can perform better than stronger ones, depending on $N/p$, see Figure 9 Appendix O. \nWe agree that these results are surprising. Indeed, we were motivated to work out the theory in order to demystify these results. In summary:\n\n- The high-dimensional theory of Section 5 and Appendix L captures this phenomenon. See in particular Figures 2 and 7, where (in some of the settings) the same phenomenon is observed both under misspecification and imperfect surrogate estimation.\n- Theorem 2 also proves the same phenomenon in a low-dimensional setting. (In this case the surrogate is assumed to be perfect, but it is elementary to see that using parameters estimated by a number of samples much smaller than $d$ yields the same result).\n- The reason for this is that the intuition âevery sample is usefulâ is only correct if the data distribution is perfectly matched to the loss function (e.g. logistic and logistic). As soon as this does not hold (which is the case in most real data applications), not all datapoints improve the estimation error. \n\n**Theorem 2.** The theorem states that the error is strictly increasing for gamma in the interval $(\\gamma_0,1)$. In particular, this means that the error at $\\gamma=\\gamma_0$ is strictly smaller than the error at $\\gamma=1$. Recalling the definition of $\\gamma$, the theorem proves that the (test) error achieved by training on subsampled data is strictly smaller than the error on the full sample ERM. We also note that:\n\n- For brevity, we state the theorem in the form âthere exists.â However, the proof is constructive and provides data distributions for which data selection improves over full sample ERM.\n- As mentioned above, the same claims can be shown to hold if the surrogate model is trained on a vanishing fraction of the n samples for which labels are provided.\n\nWe also fixed the typographical error pointed by the reviewer in the updated version. Thank you for catching it.\n\n**Proposition 4.1.** First of all, we apologize for the somewhat awkward formulation here. We were led to this by the attempt to defer to appendices material that is pedagogically useful, but is not novel.\n \nSecond, if the assumption is not satisfied, then the subsampling scheme is (roughly speaking) âmuch worseâ than (say) random subsampling. (Technically, the procedure is not consistent.) In other words, we could write a longer form of this proposition without this assumption, and establish that schemes that do not satisfy it are âvery bad.â\n\nFinally, under many models, satisfying these assumptions is fairly easy.\n\n**Proposition 4.3.** Thanks, this is a typographical error, please see the updated version.""}}, {'comment': {'value': '**Close to $n$.** Here $n$ is the target  subsample size.

Below we summarize the responses to weaknesses and questions.\n\n**Presentation.** We agree that some of the sections are somewhat terse, largely as a byproduct of fitting all the results within the space constraints. Any advice is welcome. \n\n**Semi-supervised learning.** Semi-supervised learning addresses the same problem as the one in our paper: learning under a limited âlabeling budget.â However a formal comparison is at the moment difficult because of the differences between the two settings. In semi-supervised learning, the subset of labeled examples is given (not chosen algorithmically) and the learner tries to make the best use of unlabeled examples.\n\nIn our setting, we are allowed to choose which examples to label, but once this is done, learning is carried out uniquely on the labeled examples. The two models are both interesting, but motivated by different use cases.\n\nOn the other hand, we believe it should be possible (and interesting) to define a unified setting that captures both scenarios. We expect that in this setting, a mixture of the two strategies will be required.\n\n**Imperfect surrogate models.** Empirically, Figure 9 in Appendix O carries out a comparison of surrogate models of different strength.\nMathematically, formalizing what 'optimality' means in the context of imperfect surrogates is far from obvious. This requires formalizing the notion of uncertainty about the true model.\nWe provides two types of rigorous results for imperfect surrogates:\n- *Low-dimensional.* This is mainly contained in Appendix K and summarized in Section 4.5. In particular, we prove that using a weaker model can yield better data selection (in minimax sense) than using the perfect surrogate (See Theorem 7 and Example K.2).\n- *High-dimensional.* This is mainly contained in Appendix L and summarized in Section 5. In this case we fix an imperfect surrogate and associated data selection procedure, and characterize the resulting generalization error of data learned on data selected by that procedure (See Theorems 4 and 8). We study the effect of surrogate model misspecification (Figure 2) and estimation error in the surrogate model (Figure 7).""}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful feedback and questions. Below we summarize the responses to weaknesses and questions.\n\n**Non-convexity and related questions.** We present two sets of results:\n- *Low-dimensional asymptotics*: These are not limited to convex methods, but they do assume that the global optimizer is used for estimation.\n- *High-dimensional asymptotics*: these assume a (generalized) linear model, and convex loss.\n\nThe referee raises an interesting question, which we rephrase as: \n\n*""What is the impact of data selection on the global optimization landscape in non-convex settings?""*\n\nThis is a very difficult question and indeed more basic questions are widely open in non-convex statistical settings. A few remarks:\n- If subsampling is unbiased then we expect that uniform convergence results for the landscape [e.g. Mei, Bai, Montanari Ann. Stat. 2018] can be applied to show that the whole landscape under subsampling is \'as good as\' the original one.\n- For biased subsampling, the same uniform convergence results will imply that the landscape can be characterized in terms of a certain \'modified population landscape\'. The latter can be \'worse\' or \'better\' than the original landscape, and which one will depend on a case-by-case analysis. \n- For models outside the uniform convergence regime (e.g. highly overparameterized models) the above arguments will not apply, but uniform convergence of the landscape is often too strong of a requirement, and convergence in a neighborhood of the optimization trajectory is sufficient.\n\nOverall, we think there is some promise for extending the present results to capture the effects of data selection on non-convex optimization.\n\n**Dependency on estimated parameters.** Indeed, some of our estimates depend on unobserved parameters (as pointed out in Remark C.1). However, empirical versions of these quantities can be plugged in. Under the stated assumptions, corrections due to this preplacement are negligible. We refrain from making this explicit at each passage uniquely to avoid further notational burden.\n\n**Known labels.** Our experience is that our weakly supervised approach compares well with data selection methods that make use of the actual labels.

The central objective, in the absence of access to the true labels of the data points, is to leverage the surrogate model to perform subsampling on the training data, resulting in a reduced dataset of size $n = \\gamma N$, where $\\gamma$ is a parameter in the range of $(0,1)$. This reduced dataset is then used to train the final model.\n\nThe experiments conducted by the authors have shown some intriguing outcomes. Firstly, the choice of subsampling strategy seems to have a significant impact, offering more than mere randomness in the process of reducing the samples. Secondly, in specific cases, subsampling can actually yield lower estimation errors during testing. It's worth noting that this study is supported by a solid framework of theoretical guarantees.\n\nWhile the authors have made notable strides in their experimental validations, I believe some theoretical aspects remain unaddressed through analytical tools. Several propositions and theorems presented inside the paper are scattered and might be considered as ancillary results. Nevertheless, this paper is still a solid theoretical work with robust mathematical underpinnings. The theoretical formulation of the problem and the experimental observations collectively present a nice contribution to the field, which makes this work a nice addition to ICLR.

While it is difficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar capabilities, we can measure whether they compositionally generalize, that is, whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is subsequently able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we characterize several different forms of compositional generalization that are desirable in program synthesis, forming a meta-benchmark which we use to create generalization tasks for two popular datasets, RobustFill and DeepCoder. We then propose ExeDec, a novel decomposition-based synthesis strategy that predicts execution subgoals to solve problems step-by-step informed by program execution at each step. When used with Transformer models trained from scratch, ExeDec has better synthesis performance and greatly improved compositional generalization ability compared to baselines. Finally, we use our benchmarks to demonstrate that LLMs struggle to compositionally generalize when asked to do programming-by-example in a few-shot setting, but an ExeDec-style prompting approach can improve the generalization ability and overall performance.",Oral 6A,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oTRwljRgiv,https://openreview.net/forum?id=oTRwljRgiv,oTRwljRgiv,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': ""I recommend the acceptance of the paper based on the reviews and responses provided by the authors.

This is described in Appendix C, where the beam search checks for beam states where âsome computation limit such as a maximum number of steps is reachedâ.\n\nFor the models trained from scratch:\n* For RobustFill, we have a limit of 20 steps, but we almost never reach that limit because we also require that each subprogram makes correct progress with respect to the desired output. Most of the time, if a subprogram prediction is wrong, incorrect progress will be made (which we cannot recover from due to the concatenation structure of RobustFill programs) and the beam state will be marked as invalid and removed from the beam search.\n* For DeepCoder, we have a limit of using 10 variables in the entire program (including variables used for the inputs), where each step uses a fresh variable.\n\nFor the LLM experiments: we use a limit of 3 steps.\n\n> My reading of the results in 5.2 (specifically, Table 1) is that I should divide all numbers by 200 to compare them with the results in 5.1 (Figure 2). Is this correct?\n\nIn Table 1, dividing the numbers by 200 results in percentages of problems solved. However, those percentages are not comparable with those in Figure 2 because the problems in the LLM experiments are easier, as explained in Section 5.2 and Footnote 4.\n\n> What is the comparison in FLOPs between the ExeDec models and the baseline models?\n\nThe loop in our step-by-step synthesis approaches does not lead to more âpowerâ, because our step-by-step approaches predict multiple shorter subprograms, while the Transformer baseline and Latent Programmer predict the entire long program at once. If we assume that subprograms, a set of subgoals for each example, and I/O specifications all have an equal number of tokens, then ExeDec-Small and the No-Subgoal Ablation use roughly the same number of FLOPs, or slightly more FLOPs than the Transformer baseline and Latent Programmer (only because those approaches donât need to encode the step-by-step execution information).\n\n> How do models perform on generalization tasks that they were not trained for?\n\nThe best way to answer this question may be to use the models trained without generalization, tested on the various generalization datasets. Our results for âtest on training distributionâ (i.e., the no-generalization case) can be seen as a combination of this for all generalization tasks, since the no-generalization distribution contains all of the generalization train and test distributions. But, the exact test problems themselves are different.

This is still expensive, and we thought this experimental setup would lead to less interpretable results, since weâd be testing on a distribution of programs that were seen during fine-tuning but are absent from the few-shot examples. We also werenât sure how such a setup might mirror a real-life scenario, as typically one does not have a large finetuning dataset comprising all of the generalization patterns seen at test time.\n\n> It'd be interesting to see how the Transformer baseline performs when it also has access to [execution traces]\n\nThis is also an interesting suggestion. We assume you mean that we should âpauseâ the Transformer baselineâs program prediction after each line, collect the execution trace, inject the trace into the decoding, and then âunpauseâ the prediction to get the next line. As a step-by-step program generation procedure with program execution between steps, this is already quite similar to the No-Subgoal Ablation.\n\nIf we then consider that the Transformer baseline has no way of âbacktrackingâ to change its prior prediction, and we already have a setup where we can specify all remaining work for the problem in the form of I/O examples, it would make sense that each step should not care about what prior predictions or execution traces led to the current state. In fact, conditioning on the prior steps could actually be distracting to the model, teaching it about spurious patterns that harm the generalization performance. If we treat each subprogram as a fresh prediction that is not conditioned on the previous steps, we arrive (at least in spirit) to the No-Subgoal Ablation.\n\n> Do you have an insight into why the no-subgoal ablation performs better on some generalization benchmarks?\n\nThis may be related to the kind of spurious pattern involved in the compositional generalization split. Specifically:\n\n* For Length-Generalization and Switch-Concept-Order, the index of the current subprogram carries major implications in the training distribution, i.e., âthe problem should be almost solved by nowâ or âwe must use this category of operationâ. However, those implications are drastically changed in the test distribution. The Transformer baseline is aware of the length of the prediction so far, so it can be easily confused by the distribution shift -- and indeed, it performs particularly poorly on these tasks. On the other hand, both ExeDec and the No-Subgoal Ablation are less aware of the current index of the subprogram, since the prior subprograms are only indirectly provided to the models through the program state. For these tasks, the No-Subgoal Ablation sometimes outperforms ExeDec slightly.\n* For Compose-Different-Concepts and Compose-New-Operation, the spurious pattern arises from comparison to what work needs to be done outside the current subprogram: âthis subprogram uses the same category of operation as the other subprogramsâ or âthis subprogram can only use operation X if there are no other subprogramsâ. Again, these patterns are changed between the train and test distributions. The No-Subgoal Ablation is susceptible to overfitting on these patterns because it sees the I/O specification for the current subprogram composed with all future subprograms. On the other hand, ExeDec is shielded from these spurious patterns because its SynthesizerModel only sees the I/O specification for the current subprogram (provided that the SubgoalModel predicts the correct subgoals), which may explain the larger performance gap.\n* For Add-Operation-Functionality, actually the spurious pattern is within an individual subprogram, i.e., some subprograms in test problems are outside the distribution of subprograms seen during training. None of the compared approaches are well-shielded from this form of spurious pattern, leading to the relatively low performance of our methods on this generalization task for RobustFill.

That is, for a single step in a trajectory that matches the ground-truth so far, how often does the SubgoalModel predict subgoals exactly matching the ground-truth ones (for all I/O examples) with a single greedy decoding? And, how often does the SynthesizerModel predict a program whose behavior matches the ground-truth subgoal?\n\nFor RobustFill, the SubgoalModel gets 90% - 98% single-step accuracy for the different generalization tasks, while the SynthesizerModel gets 84% on Add-Operation-Functionality and 94% - 99% on the other tasks.\n\nFor DeepCoder, the SubgoalModel gets 56% accuracy for no-generalization and 16% - 41% on the generalization tasks, while the SynthesizerModel gets 99% on no-generalization, 60% on Add-Operation-Functionality, 78% on Switch-Concept-Order, and 91 - 96% on the other tasks.\n\nNote that our âsingle-step accuracyâ metric is particularly low for the SubgoalModel on DeepCoder because there are potentially many correct ways of solving the problem, and this metric only considers the single ground-truth solution. In fact, the SubgoalModel does not need to have super high accuracy in order to achieve good end-to-end results, because the SynthesizerModel can ignore slight errors in the subgoals and still produce a program that behaves as closely as possible while only using 1 DSL operation. We have seen many concrete cases of the SynthesizerModel being given a slightly-incorrect subgoal and then producing the correct subprogram anyway, which disagrees with the subgoal but correctly makes progress overall.\n\n> In Figure 2, why do you think that ExeDec improves over the No-Subgoal ablation primarily in the Compose New Operation and Compose Different Concepts settings, and not in the other settings?\n\nThis may be related to the kind of spurious pattern involved in the compositional generalization split.

Indeed, in unit tests, educational or competitive programming challenges, and on forums like StackOverflow, I/O examples are often expected. Of course, they may be combined with other forms of specification like natural language, but developing approaches that reason about I/O examples is still an important aspect of program synthesis overall.\n\n> Both DSLs seem simple straight-line code, and there are no recursion, loops, or if-else conditions, all of which are important components to construct a realistic large program.\n\nIn general-purpose programming languages, these control flow constructs are definitely important. Extending the ExeDec approach to handle these is important future work. That said, we note that many important programming libraries do not rely on these explicit control flow constructs. For example, matrix or tensor manipulation with TensorFlow / PyTorch / Numpy for machine learning and scientific computing, exploratory data analysis with Pandas, plotting with Matplotlib, spreadsheet formulas in Excel, and MapReduce pipelines are all typically expressed with a sequence or composition of library operations, usually without explicit control flow structures from the underlying programming language.

Then in practice, with some care in implementation, one can approximate this ideal by choosing uniformly random minimal-weight solutions when generating fresh random training data for every training step. (Our code does not yet select among minimal-weight solutions uniformly, but we do generate fresh training data for each training step.)\n\n> How to process different numbers of I/O examples (the size of which may also vary) in transformer models?\n\nIn our model (Section 4.2), a Transformer encoder turns each I/O example $X_i$ into an encoding $\\\\phi_i$, which has fixed length regardless of the exampleâs size. To combine these $\\\\phi_i$ across examples, we simply concatenate them which does assume (as in our experiments) that every problem is specified with a constant number of examples.\n\nMore generally, to handle any number of I/O examples, one can instead pool across examples, $\\\\phi_{\\\\text{pool}} \\\\gets \\\\operatorname{Pool}(\\\\{\\\\phi_i\\\\})$. Then, when predicting a subgoal for example $X_i$, the SubgoalModel may use a concatenation of $\\\\phi_{\\\\text{pool}}$ (encoding the overall problem) and $\\\\phi_i$ (encoding the specific example for which we need a subgoal), passed to a Transformer decoder which predicts the desired subgoal. The SynthesizerModel can directly apply a Transformer decoder to $\\\\phi_{\\\\text{pool}}$ to predict a subprogram.\n\n> Straight-line code can be split arbitrarily, how to decide which snippets form a proper sub-goal?\n\nIn our experiments, we make initial progress by simply using a subgoal after every line (with one DSL operation per line). Future work may investigate our ideas on more realistic code, where there are other signals that may identify plausible subgoals. For instance, blank lines, comments, and logging statements often break up real code into logical steps which we can use as subgoals. Even if the ground-truth code does not contain any such signals, one may prompt a code language model to guess where blank lines might be added, to receive a suggestion based on the language modelâs ability to pattern-match to other code. Applying these ideas to real code would be very exciting to explore in future work, made possible by our initial findings on synthetic code.\n\n> It is a bit surprising that No-subgoal Ablation performs pretty well. Shouldn't it behave like the Transformer baseline?\n\nThere are two main difference between these approaches. First (and most importantly), the No-Subgoal Ablation receives program execution information after every predicted subprogram, so it can change its solution on the fly depending on the current program state, while the Transformer Baseline receives no execution information at all. Second, the No-Subgoal Ablation is trained on individual subprograms, while the Transformer Baseline was not explicitly shown how entire programs are composed of individual subprograms. In our view, these differences make the relative comparison expected.""}}, {'summary': {'value': 'This paper improves the composition generalization of neural program synthesis by introducing execution decomposition.

It was a joy to read. It explains the context of the problem well, as well as establishing the necessary preliminary knowledge before delving into its actual contribution. There is a minor exception to this for the derivations (see Weaknesses)\n2) Under the simplifying assumption that eps follows an isotropic Gaussian, the authors derive a close-form solution to the minimizer of the Gauss-Netwon loss in expectation. Under the assumption that the authors claim about poor generalization due to training-data-biased feature maps holds (see Weaknesses), the proposed solutions has the main advantage that it provides unbiased feature map. In addition, it provides the ability to control the basin of convergence, which in turn makes the proposed method more robust to bad initialization (cf. Fig 3). Lastly, the assumed simplification which was necessary to derive the closed-form solution has been shown to lead to negligible differences (cf. Fig 5)\n3) Using self-supervised features, the proposed method is capable of outperforming supervised related work on almost all metrics. This is a strong statement, as the method can be used in conjunction with large and powerful foundation models, enabling bigger generalization due to the superior dataset sizes of such models. Therefore it is complimentary to these works.\n4) The authors provide an interesting insight when using Gauss-Newton as feature matching and indicate that it may be inherently limited.

The authors claim both in the abstract as well as in the appendix that prior art use feature maps that may embed the inductive bias of the training data. While I can comprehend the underlying reasoning, such a claim needs to be empirically shown. \nFor example, an experiment on out-of-distribution test sets demonstrating the superiority of the closed-form solution would back the authors claims and in turn strengthen the paper.\n2) On the same topic of bias, I argue that the authors should explicitly state that their method still exhibits bias, but that the source of this is the underlying feature representation (result of this can be seen in Tbl. 1, Aachen Night dataset). Otherwise it may read that the authors claim their method is not biased. This is stated at the end of Section 3, but I think it should be stated clearly in either Abstract, Introduction and Conclusion section. This is a minor point however and only serves to improve clarity.\n3) A little contradictory to my point in the Strengths section, I believe the math heavy section 4 and 5 could be made a little more clearer when derivations skip multiple steps. Otherwise the sections read as if one equation immediately follows from the other, which is not always the case. (e.g Eq 6. -> Eq. 7). This would enhance the readability of the paper.\n4) On the Aachen-Night dataset, the proposed method clearly suffers. The authors claim that this is due to the underlying feature representation used, which was not trained day-night correspondences. While I find the reasoning sound, it would help the authors claim to have used a feature representation that have used such correspondences during training.

It adds convolution modules to a transformer to learn both local and global dependencies. In this work we describe a faster, more memory-efficient, and better-performing transformer, called Zipformer.  Modeling changes include: 1) a U-Net-like encoder structure where middle stacks operate at lower frame rates; 2) reorganized block structure with more modules, within which we re-use attention weights for efficiency; 3) a modified form of LayerNorm called BiasNorm allows us to retain some length information; 4)  new activation functions SwooshR and SwooshL work better than Swish.  We also propose a new optimizer, called ScaledAdam, which scales the update by each tensor's current scale to keep the relative change about the same, and also explictly learns the parameter scale. It achieves faster converge and better performance than Adam. Extensive experiments on LibriSpeech, Aishell-1, and WenetSpeech datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Zipformer over other state-of-the-art ASR models.

This is not by itself disqualifying; it is the nature of the field that SOTA systems are often published without source code. However, I expect that future work iterating on this design will struggle with direct comparison, much in the same way that this paper compares to a weaker reproduction of the original Conformer.\n\nOur code is open-sourced. The link will be put in the final version. \n\n> The comparison to the original conformer is not quite apples-to-apples, in that Zipformer-L is substantially larger than Conformer-L in both the original publication and in this paper's reproduction. I think the authors should consider including a variant of Zipformer with ~120M parameters, as originally used by Gulati et al. This would prevent the suspicion that the stronger WER simply reflects the fact that the Zipformer is larger. Still, I think Zipformer's substantially reduced computational needs demonstrate that superiority over Conformer does not only reflect model size. So, I'll recommend this paper for acceptance despite the flaw in this comparison.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the observation. We would like to suggest that the majority of the experiments are all conducted using M-scaled Zipformer model, hence the difference of # params on L-scaled model between Zipformer and Conformer does not invalidate the conclusions we claimed in the manuscript.

The model structure is mainly for higher efficiency. Swoosh functions and ScaledAdam have greater impact on performance improvement. \n\n> Will the other variants of transformer get better WER with the author proposed optimizer ?\n\nWe validated ScaledAdam on LibriSpeech using a 12-layer Conformer  (attention dim=512, feed-forward dim=2048).

To the best of our knowledge, this is so far the lowest WER reported on GigaSpeech as on https://github.com/SpeechColab/GigaSpeech. \n\n> The authors propose changes to many widely used components, ..., I am intrigued to learn how generalizable this claim can be.\n\nWe would like to emphasize the components are focused on ASR. Our experiments on LM task suggest that these can be generalized to other tasks to a certain extent, e.g., ScaledAdam and Swoosh. Please refer to the response of question 3. \n\nEmpirically, the mean subtraction is used by systems with LayerNorm as a way to ""defeat LayerNorm"", by making certain elements very large and nearly constant. This is not necessary with BiasNorm because we can ""defeat normalization"" by having a large learnable bias. We normalize the vector by RMS instead of Var. We found an extra sqrt in the denominator in Eq.2 and removed that in the revised version. \n\n> Some of the proposed modification seem arbitrary. It would be great if the authors can explain a bit. For example, in Eq (4), for the swooshR and swooshL functions, how the -0.08 is selected ? The authors mentioned that the coefficient 0.035 in Eq (4) is slightly tuned. How general is this parameter?\n\nThe -0.08 is chosen to make the negative slope to be 10% of the positive slope. \nThe coefficient 0.035 was tuned on LibriSpeech and maintained the same on all other experiments including the LM ones, suggesting its capability of generalization (refer to the response of question 3). \n\n> How sensitive of the WERs on librispeech relative to other factors like checkpoint choosing, different training run with different seed?\n\nIn our experiments, we search for different checkpoints for decoding and report the best result. In training, we set a fixed random seed for the libraries, such as random, numpy, and torch. \n\n> Missing references\n\nWe have added these references in Section 2. \n\n> About the referred paper Accelerating rnn-t training and inference using ctc guidance\n\nWe cited it in Section 2 as a related work. It leverages the guidance from the auxiliary CTC head to skip frames on the encoder output and even in the middle of the encoder. However, our work focus on improving the sequence encoder structure itself. \n\n> In Table 5 and section 4.0.3, it is unclear to me ... for different temporal resolution.\n\nAs described in Section 3.1 and Section 4.0.1 (in Table 1), stacks are of various embedding dims and feed-forward dims. For the ablation study ``no temporal downsampling"", we use Conv-Embed with downsampling rate of 4, and 12 Zipformer blocks with the same dimensions as in the middle stack (embedding dim=512, feed-forward dim=1536).'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Thanks and response to concerns'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your detailed review, below we address the key concerns. Spelling issues are fixed in the revised version, link to the code will be attached in the final version.\n\n>  About the proposed BiasNorm, Swoosh, ScaledAdam on language modeling task\n\nWe validated these components on LM task. Results indicate that using ScaleAdam and Swoosh function achieves better performance. A 18-layer transformer LM was built w. GeLU (# param. is 98M). The model was trained on the Libriheavy transcripts (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08105.pdf).  \n\nExp1: Adam w. CosineAnnealingLR and lr=4e-4;\n\nExp2: ScaledAdam w.

It is possible that the BiasNorm might not work for LM task, since our modification are done based on the observation on ASR experiments. The ablation study in Tab. 5 manifests that it is effective on Zipformer models. \n\n> For comparisons, it would have been better to use a more standard transducer, ... would have made it easier to compare the results to other results from the literature (Table 2).\n\nWe updated results of Zipformer models with CTC and CTC/AED systems in Appx. Sec. A.4.2 in the revised version. Overall, Zipformer models still outperform other ASR encoders. \n\n> The actual measured speed on some given hardware.\n\nWe compared the speed and memory usage between different ASR encoders in inference mode on a 32G V100 in Figure 3. In overall, Zipformer achieves a better trade-off between performance and efficiency than other encoders. \n\n> No systematic comparison to other Conformer variants\n\nBesides the performance comparison in Table 2, Figure 3 compares their efficiency in terms of speed and memory usage, and Sec. 2 describes their architectures and main difference between Zipformer and these variants. \n\n> How long does the training take? What batch sizes are used?\n\nPlease refer to Appx. Sec. A.4.1 of the revised version.  \n\n> ""Downsample module ... What happens if you just take the average? Or maybe use max-pooling instead? \n\nWith a factor of 2, the Downsample just performs the weighted average on every 2 frames with 2 learnable scalars that sum to one. This slightly outperforms average-pooling and max-pooling, on LibriSpeech test-clean/test-other: \n\n* ours, 2.21/4.79\n\n* average, 2.18/4.96\n\n* max-pooling, 2.24/4.87\n\n> If you downsample at the very end to 25 Hz, why not do that earlier ... So how much worse does this get?\n\nThis degrades the performance of Zipformer-M from 2.21/4.79 to 2.45/5.43 on LibriSpeech test-clean/test-other. This level of downsampling at the middle stack might be too aggressive to cause information loss. \n\n> LayerNorm/BiasNorm: When there is a large value, ..., I wonder if there are numerical problems.\n\nIt wouldn\'t be so large as to cause numerical problems. It just needs large enough to dominate the denominator so that the some length information could be retained, e.g., 50 in LayerNorm. \n\n> What is the influence of exp(Î³) vs just Î³ (without exp) in BiasNorm?\n\nLearning the scale in log space is safer in theory, since it avoids the gradient oscillation problem that we describe in Sec. 3.3. \n\n> How does ScaledAdam compare to methods like WeightNorm, where the weights are also normalized? For ScaledAdam, as I understand, adding the learnable parameter scale would actually change the model, as this scale now is also part of the model? Is this added for every parameter, or only some selected ones, e.g. the linear transformations?\n\nWeightNorm decouples the magnitude of a parameter from its direction, resulting in two parameters. ScaledAdam does not learn an extra parameter for the scale. It learns the scale by adding an update term (in Eq. 7), which amounts to adding an extra gradient term in the direction of rescaling each parameter. It eliminates the need to specify the modules to apply the weight normalization. \n\nWe mentioned this in Sec. 3.5 of the revised version.\n\n> I\'m not sure that this would make the code simpler, to have this special case? But I also wonder, what is the influence of this?\n\nThis makes the code simpler as we don\'t need to compute $\\boldsymbol\\theta_{t-1}\'$, which makes almost no impact since Adam\'s update magnitudes are invariant to gradient rescaling. \n\n> What is the influence of the Eden learning rate scheduling?\n\nEden is specially designed for ScaledAdam. Since ScaledAdam is more stable than Adam, we don\'t need a long warm-up period like in Conformer\'s learning rate schedule. We also use larger learning rate values, because we scale the update by parameter RMS (in Eq. 6), which is normally much smaller than one.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Thanks and response to concerns'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for your detailed review, below we address the key concerns.\n\n> While the motivation for biasnorm and scaledadam are well explained, the motivation for zipformer blcok, especially those downsampling and upsampling modules are not well presented.\n\nZipformer uses a downsampled encoder structure which processes the sequence at various frame rates. It allows to efficiently learn representation at different temporal resolutions. According to the comment, we have made this motivation more clear in the revised version.\n\nAs described in Section 3.2, Zipformer block has about twice the depth of the Conformer block, reusing the attention weights in different module to save computation and memory.\n\n> The results on aishell1 is not quite convincing compared to other conformer variants. The author could elaborate more on the performance. Could be that this is a small dataset?\n\nYes, Aishell-1 is a small dataset containing only 170 hours of speech, which is described in Section 4.0.1. Note that as presented in Table 3, Zipformer-S achieves better performance than Conformer implemented in ESPnet toolkit with fewer parameters, and scaling up Zipformer achieves better performance. \n\n> Curious about whether the authors tried the new activation functions, biasnorm and scaledadam on other tasks? Do they still show superiority?\n\nWe tried Swoosh function, BiasNorm, and ScaledAdam on language modeling task. Experimental results indicate that ScaledAdam and Swoosh function are able to improve the performance, while BiasNorm can't. Specifically, we build an 98M language model with 18 transformer layers with GeLU activation. The model is trained on the transcripts of Libriheavy dataset (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08105.pdf). The transcripts are converted into 500-class BPE tokens.

Specifically, for attention modules, in training we could limit the future contexts by applying the block-triangular masks on attention weights. We should also replace regular convolutions with causal convolutions. In inference, we could cache the left contexts for attention modules and convolution modules.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Thanks for the reviews and summary of key paper changes'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewers for their detailed and thoughtful reviews.

The ablation study is basically only a single experiment, showing ScaledAdam vs Adam, or LayerNorm vs BiasNorm. A single experiment is not really enough to really see how ScaledAdam vs Adam performs, or BiasNorm vs LayerNorm, etc. E.g. replaying LayerNorm by BiasNorm in a standard Transformer, maybe for language modeling, how would this perform?

Though the author gives some motivations behind these changes and give some ablation studies, it still points to the following unanswered questions: \n\n  - the authors claim that the zipformer is better than the (reproduced) conformer, squeezeformer or other variants of transformer. However, it is unclear to me whether this is because of the model structure or because of the modified optimizer ? For example, in Table 5, the author presents that with all the proposed change (model and optimizer), zipformer-M can achieve 4.79% WER on test-other, however, with the standard adam optimizer, the WER becomes 5.51%. Will the other variants of transformer get better WER with the author proposed optimizer ? \n\n  - On the other hand, I am wondering whether the proposed optimizer, which has many adhoc modifications compared with the much widely used adam optimizer, can be more widely used for other deep learning optimization tasks or does it only work for speech tasks or does it only work for zipformer ? Given the zipformer-L is a pretty small model (only 60M parameters) trained on limited data (<1000hrs) according to today\'s standard,  will the proposed change still work better than the standard adam when the model and the training data scales up? \n\n\nOther weakness of this paper include: \n\n  - The authors propose changes to many widely used components, which have been well tested over time and over different tasks beyond just speech recognition. For example, the authors claim that the mean extraction in layer norm is not necessary and also remove the variance normalization. While this may seem to work for authors use case, I am intrigued to learn how generalizable this claim can be. \n\n  - Some of the proposed modification seem arbitrary. It would be great if the authors can explain a bit. For example, in Eq (4), for the swooshR and swooshL functions, how the -0.08 is selected ? The authors mentioned that the coefficient 0.035 in Eq (4) is slightly tuned. How general is this parameter ? \n\n- In the ablation study, quite a few modifications results in less than 0.2% absolute WER change. How sensitive of the WERs on librispeech relative to other factors like checkpoint choosing, different training run with different seed ? In my own experiments, these factors can result in up to 0.1% WER changes.\n\n\n- The authors also miss a series of work in the literature that directly apply standard transformer (without much modification) for ASR.

Current research efforts mainly focus on improving model architectures and learning algorithms on fixed datasets to achieve this goal. In contrast, in this paper, we address an orthogonal yet crucial problem: given a fixed convex learning model (or a convex surrogate for a non-convex model) and a function of interest, we assess what data benefits the model by interpreting the feature space, and then aim to improve performance as measured by this function. To this end, we propose the use of influence estimation models for interpreting the classifier's performance from the perspective of the data feature space. Additionally, we propose data selection approaches based on influence that enhance model utility, fairness, and robustness. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches not only for conventional classification scenarios, but also under more challenging scenarios such as distribution shifts, fairness poisoning attacks, utility evasion attacks, online learning, and active learning.",Oral 7B,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HE9eUQlAvo,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HE9eUQlAvo,HE9eUQlAvo,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'The paper presents an innovative data-selection approach that enhances model performance.\n\nKey strengths highlighted by reviewers include: 1) addressing an important research problem; 2) considering various settings ranging from noisy labels, active learning, and adversarial robustness to fairness; 3) conducting thorough experiments with promising results; and 4) having numerous applications.\n\nDuring the rebuttal, the authors made significant clarifications, and all reviewers acknowledged that all major concerns have been well addressed.\n\nGiven the positive feedback from reviewers, the AC recommends accepting this paper.'}, 'justification_for_why_not_higher_score': {'value': 'NA'}, 'justification_for_why_not_lower_score': {'value': 'Many strengths have been highlighted by reviewers, including addressing an important research problem, considering various settings, conducting thorough experiments, and having many applications.

It seems that for some different seed values, indeed TMC-Shapley can work as intended (somewhat similar trends as the reviewer obtained), which we unfortunately did not see originally for our single seed experiment.\n    * We realized that another reason for the unsatisfactory result was possibly a mismatch in the logistic regression classifier; we use the one for our influence computation (we used PyTorch to train the model) to evaluate accuracy upon deletion/retraining, but this is different from the one used by TMC-Shapley to do data valuation in the backend. As a result, the mismatch might have been leading to slight errors. We  thank the reviewer for their efforts in providing code which led us to think about why this might be happening more critically.\n    * Thus, we will mention and showcase in Section E.2 of the paper (after working to minimize the classifier mismatch) that TMC-Shapley can work well but there might be inconsistencies in comparison (such as in the classifier implementation used and seed values considered). We will provide trends averaged over multiple seeds for TMC-Shapley for this reason. However, our main point stands that TMC-Shapley does not run in reasonable time on the full sized datasets we consider in the paper and we would like to emphasize this as well.\n    \n___\n\n* **Percentages in Deletion and Two-way Deletion**:\n    * We are deleting percentages in an automated fashion, but as is evident if the percentage leads to a fractional value, we make them integral as the number of points to be deleted has to be an integer value.\n    * For our main experiments (Section 4) and non-conventional classification experiments (Section 5), even 5% data deletion can be a large number of samples, in contrast with the subsampled Bank dataset experiment of Appendix E.2 which was just a simple experiment with 100 training samples. For example, for CelebA, 5% deletion implies deleting 3124 samples (5% of 62497 training samples). \n    * Regarding two-way deletion (high influence and low influence samples), we agree with the reviewer's great suggestion. Given that we have a large number of experiments in the paper and the dataset sizes are quite large, re-running all experiments would be quite time consuming. If the reviewer would like to see a specific experiment with high influence sample removal, we are happy to explore it and try to finish it within the author-reviewer discussion period. Also thematically, our applications considered in this paper are geared towards improving performance and hence, deleting low influence samples makes more sense. Our primary focus in this work is also not just influence trimming, but only using it as a tool for one facet of the paper and showcasing how feature ranges can be interpreted for improved performance in diverse settings (such as active learning and online learning). We will definitely aim to study high influence sample deletion in future work.\n\n___\n___\n\nThank you once again for all your efforts, we are very grateful.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Additional Response to Reviewer MEKL [1/2]'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Dear Reviewer MEKL, thank you for your prompt response and evaluating the newly provided code.

We apologize for any inconvenience due to a lack of clarity on our part. We also would like to thank the reviewer for their excellent code which we have now used to provide clarifications.\n\n* **Time Complexity Experiments**: \n    * Our time complexity results in the paper (Table 2 in Appendix E) and the results comparing training sample deletions for our influence approach and TMC-Shapley (Figure 10 in Appendix E) are NOT undertaken on the same (Bank) dataset. \n    * For all the results in the entire paper (Figures 2, 5, 6, 9, and others) we have considered full versions of the Bank, CelebA, Adult, and Jigsaw Toxicity datasets. \n    * However, as Table 2 shows, TMC-Shapley was unable to run in reasonable time on these full datasets, and hence, we resorted to doing a simple experiment on a subsampled training set for Bank (only 100 samples), but the test set was kept unchanged. We also mentioned this in Appendix E.2, but we will aim to make this point much more clearly.\n    * This subsampled version of the Bank dataset is the one we provided to the reviewer since TMC-Shapley was unable to run on the full versions that we did all our experiments on. This is also why the reviewer noted that the 80-20% split was not adhered to, and that the shape of the training set was (100, 51) and test set was (6098, 51). \n    * We have now used the reviewer\'s excellent code and provided our original data files for all datasets here: <https://anonymous.4open.science/r/time_complexity_iclr-EB0A/>. In this repository, we provide the experiments on time complexity as a notebook (please refer to `time_complexity.ipynb`), and it can be seen that TMC-Shapley fails to run in a reasonable time on these full versions of the datasets.\n    * We would also like to mention that our first original code repository provided in the paper: <https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IDS/> contains all the experiments for our approach where we experimented on the full datasets. The sizes of these datasets are as follows: Bank (30488), Adult (45222), CelebA (104163), and Jigsaw Toxicity (30000). The split details are also provided in Appendix C.1.\n\n___\n\n* **Random Deletion Experimental Results**:\n    * We would like to mention that in the reviewer\'s provided code, random deletion is undertaken till up to 40% of the dataset. In contrast, our experiments in the main paper (Figure 2 and others such as Figure 8 and 9) all focus on 5% data ""trimming."" Here our goal was to show how our influence based trimming approach can be extremely advantageous even for small % of data removals especially on full sized datasets. \n    * In the specific experiments of Appendix E.2 we decided to trim up to 12.5%. Even for the reviewer\'s obtained results for random deletion that match with this setting on the subsampled Bank dataset (`rebuttal_results2/dval_10_lowtohigh`) it can be seen that random deletion is almost a constant line up till 10-12%. \n    * The reason for a low removal % in our main experiments on the full datasets is that even 5% of removal often leads to desired performance: for example in Figure 2, Bank and CelebA reach DP (fairness) values close to 0 around 1% or 2% and hence, further trimming is not necessary. Similarly for a lot of the accuracy/robustness experiments, no further improvements in utility can be obtained after a certain point, indicating that we have reached the desired upper bound for accuracy. For fair comparison with our approach, we also randomly delete samples only up to 5%.\n    \n___'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Additional Response to Reviewer ZqCd'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Dear Reviewer ZqCd, thank you for your prompt response, we appreciate your help in strengthening our paper.\n\nRegarding the additional comparisons with time complexity, we agree with the reviewer. We have provided additional details comparing time complexity of multiple approaches, categorized across sections of the paper (Section 4 in the conventional classification setting and Section 5.1 with a number of fairness intervention baselines):\n\n* **Influence Trimming Comparison Baselines (Section 4):**\n\n    * As described previously, for our methods, Algorithm 1 can achieve a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n(pm + d))$ (by using better tree-building methods). For Algorithm 2 the time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(n(pm + log(n)))$. \n    * For a Shapley value based data valuation approach, (for example TMC-Shapley of Ghorbani et al), the time complexity will be $\\mathcal{O}(2^{n}mT) + \\mathcal{O}(nlog(n))$ where $T$ is the training iteration count (epochs). This complexity is computed similar to time complexity for Algorithm 2: the first term is the data valuation step, and the second is the sorting/trimming step. It can be seen that just by the first term time alone, time complexity is exponential in $n$ which is much slower than our methods.\n    * Further, note we can remove the dependence of the number of parameters $p$ in our approach by using more improved influence computation approaches such as Representer Point (Yeh et al, 2018). The improved time complexity of Algorithm 1 would then be $\\mathcal{O}(n(m + d))$ and of Algorithm 2 would be $\\mathcal{O}(n(m + log(n)))$. This modification would lead to very high computational efficiency.\n\n___\n\n* **Fairness Distribution Shift Methods (Section 5.1):** \n\n    * Influence-based Reweighing (Li et al, 2022): First, this method also requires an influence computation step similar to our work which can take $\\mathcal{O}(npm)$ time. Then it solves a linear program (LP) with $n$ variables, and using interior point methods an LP can be solved in polynomial time. For e.g. using Vaidya's method (Vaidya, 1989) an LP can be solved in $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2.5})$.

However, it is not clear that the difference between previous work and this work mathematically.**_\n\n     - The difference between previous work (such as Koh and Liang\'s work) is that those provide an approach for computing influence at the sample-level whereas we are trying to derive general ""rule sets"" at the feature-level for how features affect influence. For example, in Koh and Liang\'s work, they can obtain influence $I(x_i)$ for a sample $x_i$ (or change in output with sample-level perturbations). In our work, we use a large set of such samples (and their labels) and their influence values, to train an interpretable estimator, such as CART. This can then be used to derive a general interpretation for influence using the feature space-- for example some rules for Accuracy from our 2-D feature space in Figure 1 are: Feature 1 $>= 1.9$ and Feature 2 $< 0.1$ lead to high influence while Feature 1 $< 1.9$ and Feature 2 $< 0.1$ lead to low influence.\n\n    - This sort of feature-level interpretation of performance gain via influence has not been undertaken in the literature previously. This can be useful in many scenarios, some of which we outline below but are not limited to only these: \n\n        **(1)** When new data needs to be added that we do not have influence scores for yet, we can use the influence estimator to obtain influence scores simply via inference. For Koh and Liang\'s approach, they would still need to train the model once with all samples under consideration every time a new sample arrives. \n\n        **(2)** In algorithmic data recourse scenarios [4] such as to describe why an individual was denied a loan, it can be used to provide an interpretable justification for why a decision was made simply by describing the tree rules that were either met or violated by the data sample.\n\n        **(3)** In active learning, traditional influence computation (such as using Koh and Liang\'s work) is not viable since there is no access to the sample labels. Previous work such as ISAL [5] (one competitive method in our paper) have still utilized influence in these scenarios, but these do not work as well, since they use the base model itself to generate pseudo-labels for prediction. Our approach using the decision tree serves as an effective and much better alternative, as is evident in the active learning experiments of our paper (Section 5.5 - Figure 6E), where we compare with ISAL. \n\n        **(4)** In some sense, we are bridging feature-interpretation approaches (such as Shapley values and LIME) with sample-interpretation approaches (such as Data Valuation and Influence), and hence, can accommodate any applications that these are used for.\n    ___\n\n\n* _**I am confused about the proposed method of this paper, as the paper just combines the influence estimation and decision tree. Also, why do we need this tree?**_\n\n    Please refer to our response above for our answer to this question. Thank you. If the reviewer raised extra concerns, we are happy to address them.\n\n    ___\n\n\n* _**For the method in Section 3.2, what is its time/space complexity?**_\n\n    Our algorithms are computationally efficient and can scale with large datasets. We provide analytical details on the time complexity below.\n\n    **Algorithm 1 Time Complexity**: For calculating computational complexity, we need to analyze the two steps of our influence estimation process. First, the influence computation of training samples and a given base model requires $\\mathcal{O}(npm)$ time where $n,p$, and $m$ are number of training samples, model parameters, and test samples respectively. Please refer to Section 3 of Koh and Liang\'s paper for how influence can be computed in $\\mathcal{O}(npm)$ using stochastic estimation or conjugate gradients. Second, the cost of training time of the influence estimation tree in the worst case is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$ where $d$ is the number of features. Thus, the overall complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(npm) + \\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$. Note that the quadratic dependence of the second term can be made linear in $n$ simply be using more sophisticated tree-building methods [6] which have a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(nd)$. Since the overall time complexity will then be linear: $\\mathcal{O}(n(pm + d))$, the approaches proposed are amenable to large scale datasets (CelebA in our experiments has 104K samples). Furthermore, our approaches work with very high-dimensional data as well. As shown in experiments on the image (CelebA) and NLP (Jigsaw Toxicity) datasets we consider in the paper, we utilize embeddings obtained by deep learning models as a preprocessing step prior to our approach. This significantly reduces the dataset feature size, and at the same time allows for a rich and powerful feature space that can be used to train our models/methods.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer ZqCd [1/3]'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We would like to sincerely thank the reviewer for their review, we are appreciative of their efforts, time, and consideration. Below we provide answers to the concerns raised:\n\n* _**Essentially, this paper studies the problem of ""coreset selection"", which is not a new problem in machine learning. Coreset selection surely is related to the above topics. Therefore, it seems that there is no need to introduce so much redundant content in the main paper.**_\n\n    We would like to emphasize here that coreset selection and our work differ in multiple ways and our main motivation is not aligned with the motivation for coreset selection. We provide more details on these differences below:\n\n    **Motivation and Research Question**: Coreset selection [1,2] is primarily associated with condensing and reducing the size of the training dataset for accelerating training and making training more efficient (for e.g. in deep learning) without sacrificing performance. In contrast, our work is motivated by assessing what type of data is generally beneficial/detrimental for the model by _interpreting the feature space_, and then using _data trimming/selection_ approaches to minimally modify the training set so as to improve performance with respect to _multiple functions of interest_. In our paper currently we had already cited both [1] and [2] (coreset selection approaches) and discussed them at a high-level, but we can describe these differences of motivation in comparison with our work in more detail in the revision.\n\n    **Other Empirical Justification**: To further reinforce the differences in motivation, it can be seen that for coreset selection [1,2] the training data is reduced to be just about 20-30% of the original training dataset size (that is trimming of up to 80%). This is in stark contrast to our work, where we are minimally trimming the training set-- for example, in Figure 2 we only trim up to 5%. Note that we trim minimally in all experiments of our paper, and do not consider removing a large set of samples, as data efficiency is not our main concern.\n    \n    **Differences in Generality**: Different coreset selection methods generally need to be proposed for each function of interest, as it is non-trivial to apply a coreset selection method for accuracy to fairness [3]. This is also in stark contrast to our work, where we seek to have general and simple approaches that can easily be applied to multiple functions of interest (fairness, accuracy, robustness, etc.) in a trivial way. This makes our approaches more general than coreset selection, which would be more specific. This is also observable by the widespread application of our methods to problem scenarios that extend beyond conventional classification, such as online learning and active learning. For instance, it is not immediately clear how coreset selection could be applied to active learning.\n\n    ___\n\n* _**Could the paper provide more high-level intuitions about the formulas of the overall regression tree prediction and hierarchical shrinkage regularizes?**_\n\n    We apologize for any lack of clarity and will make these descriptions clearer in the main text. \n\n    **Overall Regression Tree Prediction**: Since the predictions for a particular node are dependent on where it lies in the tree, the tree model prediction can be denoted as a telescoping sum. We start with the average prediction response at the root node and then keep summing over the individual prediction response at each node (calculated as differences in the average prediction response between successive nodes). This provides us with the prediction at a particular query leaf in the tree. \n\n    **Hierarchical Shrinkage Regularization**: Without hierarchical shrinkage the tree might have some leaves that noisily influence estimates as they have only a few samples. This can affect both interpretability of the tree as well as predictive capability. To counteract this, hierarchical shrinkage is a powerful yet simple approach. Here, we replace the average prediction response over a leaf with a weighted average of the mean or average responses over the leaf and each of its ancestors. The weights depend on the number of samples in each leaf, and are controlled by the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ specified at run-time. Mathematically, this is observable with the slight modification to the summation over individual predictive responses at nodes where we divide the predictive response by the number of samples the node contains as well as $\\lambda$, the regularization parameter.\n    \n    ___'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer MEKL [3/3]'}, 'comment': {'value': '* _**It looks like the authors do one utility at a time. Due to often competing utilities, for example, key features and samples for fairness might not necessarily be the same for accuracy, and in most cases might have a negative influence. It would be interesting to see an interplay of various utilities.**_\n\n    Thank you for the great suggestion, we can do this using our current obtained results. By observing the joint overlapping influence regions (or influence tree rules) for multiple functions of interest we can assess what samples contribute positively or negatively to both the functions of interest being considered (fairness, utility, etc.). In the current version of our paper, we did not do this since visualization for this is somewhat non-trivial and messy; however, in practice this is easy to do using our approach. **To exemplify this, we provide new analysis for the synthetic toy dataset of Section 4, for both accuracy + fairness in Figure 25 (Section R1, Page 32) of our revised paper PDF, and for accuracy + robustness in Figure 26 (Section R2, Page 32) of our revised paper PDF**. It can be seen that there are certain samples that are beneficial to remove for both accuracy and robustness, but for fairness and accuracy there is no overlap. Through this, we would like to emphasize that making joint improvements along multiple functions of interest is a dataset-dependent property and at times it might not be possible to make improvements along both functions (for e.g. the fairness-accuracy tradeoff [3]).\n\n    ___\n\n* _**Although authors use several datasets, all of them are binary settings. Value computation increases with classes, so I am curious to know if this is the reason authors only focused on binary settings or if there is another reason behind this design choice.**_\n\n    The choice for utilizing binary classification datasets are based on three factors. **First**, a number of approaches and work in fairness explicitly consider binary classification [3-5] as it is easier to interpret outcomes, and since we wanted to compare with these fairness baselines, we sought to utilize binary datasets throughout the paper. For example for works in both Section 5.1 (fairness distribution shift) and Section 5.2 (fairness poisoning attacks) datasets have binary classes. **Second**, we believe and hope that since our approaches are general, the binary case can be empirically extended to the multi-class case in future work without too much of a challenge. **Third**, a minor consideration was to have _neater_ looking trees when visualized. In the binary case, the class label can only take on two values, but in the multi-class case it would take on many different combinations and interplay with features in numerous ways leading to more complex trees. \n\n\n___\n___\n\n**References:**\n1.

Could the authors also explain Figure 2C?**_\n\n    - We understand the reviewer's point of view regarding constant utility values, but this is not as surprising as the very small number of randomly sampled points that are then deleted (less than 5%) might not necessarily be contributing to utility in a significant way. This trend is also observable in other work on data valuation. For example in the Data Shapley paper by Ghorbani et al, observe Figure 1 (a) and (b) and only view the scale till 5% (as the authors there consider up to 40% removals). It is evident that random deletion does not change the results that much up until a very large portion of the data is removed.\n\n    - Regarding Figure 2C, since CelebA is a high-dimensional complex image dataset and we are using a logistic regression model the accuracy value obtained is most likely an upper bound and the model cannot improve upon it further. That is why even after removing low influence samples, we do not see performance improvements (but it also does not drop). With random deletion, since the scale is fairly zoomed in between 0.853 and 0.854 the variance is possibly leading to more of an observable trend (it drops below the original value as well at times). Note that when we use the MLP model on CelebA which has a non-linear decision boundary we can actually improve upon accuracy much more significantly (as is observable in Figure 8C in the Appendix), backing the above hypothesis.\n\n    ___\n\n* _**Figure 10 in the appendix.

However, despite this lack of provable theoretical guarantee, by adding a damping term to the model's Hessian or using convex surrogates, our experiments on non-convex models such as MLPs and (preliminary results on) BERT in the appendix, we obtain significant performance improvements using our proposed approaches for multiple functions of interest.

This also has implementations of additional baselines which we discuss in a subsequent response. Next, we discuss analytical details on time complexity of our algorithms. \n\n    - The tree-based influence model of Algorithm 1 is computationally efficient and can scale with large datasets. It has a training time of $\\mathcal{O}(npm) + \\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$ in the worst case where $n$, $p$, $m$, and $d$ are the number of training samples, the number of model parameters, the number of test samples, and the number of features, respectively. The first term is for the influence computation step (please refer to Section 3 of Koh and Liang's paper for how influence can be computed in $\\mathcal{O}(npm)$ using stochastic estimation or conjugate gradients) and the second is for training and constructing the tree model. The biggest factor here is the quadratic dependence on the number of training samples, which can be made linear in $n$ simply by using more sophisticated tree-building methods [1] that have a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(nd)$. This would result in an improved overall time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n(pm + d))$. Thus the model can scale easily to larger datasets on modern hardware. This is also evident in our experiments in the paper on the CelebA dataset that has 104K samples and runs computationally efficiently even with a standard tree-building algorithm such as CART (it takes 2.455 seconds to run on average on a Linux server with an Intel Xeon 2.2GHz CPU).\n\n    ___\n\n* _**The scale for accuracy on some figures in 2 is not intuitive. Is it possible for authors to adopt similar scales for similar utilities across datasets?**_\n\n    We understand the reviewer's concern regarding the figure scales; unfortunately, employing same scales across the different subfigures for a function of interest would make it challenging to observe the differences in the trends across different datasets. For example consider accuracy-- for Adult the values vary from 0.826 to 0.832, for Bank they vary from 0.80 to 0.90, and for Jigsaw Toxicity they vary from 0.735 to 0.744. Thus, using the same scale (say 0.735 to 0.90) would make all the trends for datasets except Bank look like a constant line. This is because the metric values are highly dataset-dependent and comparative analysis necessitates individual scales for each dataset. \n\n\n    ___""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer MiDf [2/2]'}, 'comment': {'value': '* **Response to Weaknesses**: (Continued)\n\n    - > Feature explanation is a key aspect in this paper; however, the connection of feature explanation using the influence function with existing explainable AI literature is lacking.\n\n        Thank you for the great suggestion for strengthening the paper. We will add a paragraph for discussion on this in the main paper as follows:\n\n        _Most explainable and interpretable ML/AI approaches leverage feature importances to understand why models decided on a particular class label for a sample. For instance in [3], the goal is to obtain what regions of the image contribute most to the model picking that label for the given image.

Except for the Robust Fair Logloss Classifier (RLL) which is an in-processing approach, all baselines belong to this category. **Third**, our aim was to select approaches that have been specifically used for mitigating fairness distribution shift or have robustness properties so as to counter fairness shift. All the approaches considered (Correlation Shift, Influence-based Reweighing, FairBatch, and RLL) meet this criteria. Additionally, Influence-based Reweighing is a recent approach from 2022 that also utilizes influence functions, so our aim was to show how our proposed approach can improve performance even more when used in conjunction with it.

Below we provide answers to the weaknesses and questions raised:\n\n* **Response to Weaknesses**:\n\n    - > Limitation on model class: The authors provide a discussion on why the influence function evaluations are limited to convex classifiers, possible remedies, and recently applications to deep neural networks.

However, there is no analysis on the credibility, time complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. It seems that these algorithms are not scalable to large-scale datasets.\n\n        Both our proposed algorithms are very computationally efficient and can scale with large datasets. We provide more analytical details on time complexity below.\n\n        **Algorithm 1 Time Complexity**: For calculating computational complexity, we need to analyze the two steps of our influence estimation process. First, the influence computation of training samples and a given base model requires $\\mathcal{O}(npm)$ time where $n,p$, and $m$ are number of training samples, model parameters, and test samples respectively. Please refer to Section 3 of Koh and Liang's paper for how influence can be computed in $\\mathcal{O}(npm)$ using stochastic estimation or conjugate gradients. Second, the cost of training time of the influence estimation tree in the worst case is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$ where $d$ is the number of features. Thus, the overall complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(npm) + \\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$. Note that the quadratic dependence of the second term can be made linear in $n$ simply be using more sophisticated tree-building methods [1] which have a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(nd)$. Since the overall time complexity will be linear, the approaches proposed are amenable to large scale datasets (CelebA in our experiments has 104K samples). Furthermore, our approaches work with very high-dimensional data as well. As shown in experiments on the image (CelebA) and NLP (Jigsaw Toxicity) datasets we consider in the paper, we utilize embeddings obtained by deep learning models as a preprocessing step prior to our approach. This significantly reduces the dataset feature size, and at the same time allows for a rich and powerful feature space that can be used to train our models/methods.\n\n        **Algorithm 2 Time Complexity**: The time complexity of Algorithm 2 is easier to calculate. Note that the influence values provided once at input require $\\mathcal{O}(npm)$ to calculate as mentioned before. Then the sorting step requires $\\mathcal{O}(n log(n))$ in the worst case. The other operations (lines 8-9) are linear vector operations, leading to a worst case time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n(pm + log(n))$. This is not a computational bottleneck for large datasets as the time complexity is linear or logarithmic for each factor.\n\n    ___\n\n    - > The utility, fairness and adversarial robustness are important performance metrics for a classifier; however, there is a lack of a unifying story to connect all three and therefore the discussion and experiments may seem distracted\n\n        Thank you for the great suggestion, we can do this using our current obtained results. By observing the joint overlapping influence regions (or influence tree rules) for multiple functions of interest we can assess what samples contribute positively or negatively to both the functions of interest being considered (fairness, utility, etc.). In the current version of our paper, we did not do this since visualization for this is somewhat non-trivial and messy; however, in practice this is easy to do using our approach. **To exemplify this, we provide new analysis for the synthetic toy dataset of Section 4, for both accuracy + fairness in Figure 25 (Section R1, Page 32) of our revised paper PDF, and for accuracy + robustness in Figure 26 (Section R2, Page 32) of our revised paper PDF**. It can be seen that there are certain samples that are beneficial to remove for both accuracy and robustness, but for fairness and accuracy there is no overlap. Through this, we would like to emphasize that making joint improvements along multiple functions of interest is a dataset-dependent property and at times it might not be possible to make improvements along both functions (for e.g. the fairness-accuracy tradeoff [2]).\n    \n\n    ___""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer GBD9'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We would like to thank the reviewer for their thoughtful review and for all their time and effort spent in reviewing our work. Below we answer the questions raised:\n\n* _**How do the tree-based influence estimation models proposed by the authors scale with very large datasets, and what are the computational costs associated with these models?**_\n\n    The tree-based influence models are computationally efficient and can scale with large datasets. They have a training time of $\\mathcal{O}(npm) + \\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$ in the worst case where $n$, $p$, $m$, and $d$ are the number of training samples, model parameters, test samples, and features, respectively. The first term is for the influence computation step (please refer to Section 3 of Koh and Liang\'s paper for how influence can be computed in $\\mathcal{O}(npm)$ using stochastic estimation or conjugate gradients) and the second is for training and constructing the tree model. The biggest factor here is the quadratic dependence on the number of training samples for constructing the tree, which can be made linear in $n$ simply by using more sophisticated tree-building methods [1], which have a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(nd)$. This will result in an overall time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n(pm + d))$. Thus the model can scale easily to larger datasets on modern hardware. This is also evident in our experiments in the paper on the CelebA dataset that has 104K samples and runs computationally efficiently even with a standard tree-building algorithm such as CART (it takes 2.455 seconds to run on average on a Linux server with an Intel Xeon 2.2GHz CPU).\n\n    ___\n\n* _**Could the authors provide insights into the computational complexity of their influence estimation approach, and are there any strategies they recommend for scaling it to big data applications?**_\n\n    Our approaches can be used with big data. For calculating computational complexity, please refer to the previous response. As mentioned before, even though the overall time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(npm) + \\mathcal{O}(n^2 d)$, using more sophisticated tree-building methods [1] we can improve time complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(n(pm + d))$ which is linear in $n$. Furthermore, for very high-dimensional data ($d$ is large), a feature extraction step can reduce time complexity considerably. For the image (CelebA) and NLP (Jigsaw Toxicity) datasets we consider in the paper, we utilize embeddings obtained by deep learning models as a preprocessing step prior to our approach. This significantly reduces the dataset feature size, and at the same time allows for a rich and powerful feature space that can be used to train our models/methods.\n\n    ___\n\n* _**How does the tree model handle high-dimensional data, such as images, where feature interactions are more complex? Could the authors elaborate on any modifications or extensions to their approach that might be necessary to apply it effectively to image data or other high-dimensional datasets?**_\n\n    Our approaches can be used efficiently with high-dimensional image and text datasets simply by employing a feature extraction preprocessing step on the raw data such as by obtaining embeddings from a deep learning model or some other approach. This is how we conduct experiments on CelebA and Jigsaw Toxicity datasets. For e.g., we use the Mini-LM transformer model to get embeddings for the Jigsaw Toxicity dataset and then conduct experiments on it. This significantly reduces the dataset feature size which further reduces the overall worst case time complexity. Additionally, we would also like to mention that past work has found that pixel-level interpretation of images is not akin to human interpretation/reasoning, and hence, prototype-based explanations are generally preferred [2]. Hence, for raw image data, using a feature extraction step for preprocessing is a viable option for improved interpretation.\n\n    ___\n\n* _**The work presented focuses on convex models or convex surrogates for non-convex models. Could the authors discuss the potential limitations of this?**_\n\n    The most fundamental limitation of the convexity assumption is that for non-convex models it is not possible to derive theoretical guarantees for the efficacy of influence functions. However, despite this lack of provable theoretical guarantee, in practice this does not invalidate the use of influence functions in non-convex models. By adding a damping term to the model\'s Hessian or using convex surrogates, influence functions can obtain satisfactory results. For instance, in our experiments on non-convex models such as MLPs and (preliminary results on) BERT in the appendix, we obtain performance improvements using our proposed approaches for multiple functions of interest. \n\n___\n___\n\n**References:**\n\n1.

We will cite these and include discussion on them in the main text. We contextualize them with regards to our approaches below:\n\n    * A major difference between our work and [3-7] is that none of these works focus on feature-level interpretability approaches that can allow practitioners to understand and interpret what feature ranges benefit the model or lead to its detriment. There are other differences as well, which we discuss individually below. \n\n    * [3,4,5]: In [3], authors focus specifically on relabeling schemes for harmful training samples using influence functions. While thematically related to improving model performance using influence, the approach taken in our work contrasts with theirs in terms of overall motivation and generality of methods. Our data selection methods and feature-level interpretations via influence are extremely general and simple, and can hence be applied to fairness, accuracy, robustness, and many scenarios such as distribution shift, adversarial attacks, active learning, etc. The authors in [4,5] extend the ideas proposed in [3] to fairness metrics, with [5] also allowing for addition and removal of samples specific to the profile of the practitioner. However, it is important to note that based on [3] and [4], different labeling functions need to be proposed for different functions of interest (fairness, utility, etc.) whereas with our approach this issue does not arise due to its simplicity and generality. \n    * [6]: This work specifically studies fairness of samples by generating counterfactual samples and then measuring their influence. While this work can aid understanding of the fairness of training samples, its motivation is different from our work, which seeks to extend and apply influence functions for model performance gains across multiple metrics of interest and for feature-level interpretability.\n    * [7]: In this work authors propose a downweighting scheme for training samples to study improvements in fairness for a number of fairness metrics. In spirit, this work is close to ours on influence-based data selection. However, the approaches proposed are more complex and specific to the study of fairness, whereas we opt for simpler and general approaches that can be widely applied in many settings, even beyond traditional classification.\n\n    ___\n\n* **Tabular Data**: We understand the reviewer\'s concern. We would like to point out that while 3 of the 5 datasets we consider are natively tabular datasets, the remaining 2 are vision/image (CelebA) and text/NLP datasets (Jigsaw Toxicity). Our approaches can be used with image and text datasets by using a feature extraction step. That is, feature extraction from the raw data needs to be undertaken as a preprocessing step using embeddings from a deep learning model or some other approach. This is how we conduct experiments on CelebA and Jigsaw Toxicity datasets. For example, we use the Mini-LM transformer model to get embeddings for the Jigsaw Toxicity dataset and then conduct experiments on it as if it were a tabular dataset. We would also like to mention that past work has found that pixel-level interpretation of images is not akin to human interpretation/reasoning, and hence, prototype-based explanations are generally preferred [8]. Hence, for raw image data, using a feature extraction step for preprocessing is a viable option for improved interpretation.\n\n___\n___\n\n**References:**\n1.

For example, in Koh and Liang\'s work, they can obtain influence $I(x_i)$ for a sample $x_i$ (or change in output with sample-level perturbations). In our work, we use a large set of such samples (and their labels as mentioned previously) and their influence values, to train an interpretable estimator, such as CART. This can then be used to derive a general interpretation for influence using the feature space-- for example some rules for Accuracy from our 2-D feature space in Figure 1 are: Feature 1 $>= 1.9$ and Feature 2 $< 0.1$ lead to high influence while Feature 1 $< 1.9$ and Feature 2 $< 0.1$ lead to low influence.\n\n\n        - This sort of feature-level interpretation of performance gain via influence has not been undertaken in the literature previously. This can be useful in many scenarios, some of which we outline below (but are not limited to only these):\n \n            **(1)** When new data needs to be added that we do not have influence scores for yet, we can use the influence estimator to obtain influence scores simply via inference. For Koh and Liang\'s approach, they would still need to train the model once with all samples under consideration every time a new sample arrives. \n\n            **(2)** In algorithmic data recourse scenarios [1] such as to describe why an individual was denied a loan, it can be used to provide an interpretable justification for why a decision was made simply by describing the rules that were either met or violated by the data sample.\n\n            **(3)** In active learning, traditional influence computation (such as using Koh and Liang\'s work) is not viable since there is no access to the sample labels. Previous work such as ISAL [2] (one competitive method in our paper) have still utilized influence in these scenarios, but these do not work as well, since they use the base model itself to generate pseudo-labels for prediction. Our approach using CART serves as an effective and much better alternative, as is evident in the active learning experiments of our paper (Section 5.5 - Figure 6E), where we compare with ISAL. Note here we have to train the CART estimator without labels.\n\n            **(4)** In some sense, we are bridging feature-level interpretation approaches (such as Shapley values and LIME) with sample-level interpretation approaches (such as Data Valuation and Influence), and hence, can accommodate any applications that these are used for.\n\n\n    - > Another point here is that in the rest of the paper, the trimming-based approach is really what the authors use and not the CART procedure. \n\n        - The trimming-based approach can be used for performance gain, but for the interpretation of performance gain, the CART procedure is needed (See Figure 3 and Appendix F). Moreover, we use the CART approach for our active learning experiments of Section 5.5 to estimate the influence of samples in the unlabeled pool set. Observing these results (also the additional ones in the appendix for the same) it is evident that our approach outperforms multiple other baselines, and is beneficial. Moreover, we believe Algorithm 1 provides qualitative practical value: for example, as we do in Section 5.5, a practitioner could use the decision tree model to interpret what samples are actually beneficial for active learning, and hence provide justification (to annotators and other stakeholders) for why it was picked for labeling. As mentioned before, another example is for a loan approval model where Algorithm 1 can be used to easily derive reasons (citing training set feature values) for why an applicant was rejected. This might even shed light on incorrect decisions being made by the model.     \n        - Examples of such influence estimation trees (i.e. interpretable rule sets) derived from Algorithm 1 can be seen in Appendix F. There is a huge body of literature on interpreting model\'s predictions, but  to our best knowledge, interpreting model\'s performance gain at the feature-level using influence has not been undertaken yet. \n    \n   \n___'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer bDe3 [1/3]'}, 'comment': {'value': ""We would like to thank the reviewer for their deep analysis of our work, and their time, effort, and consideration.

We would first like to illustrate our motivation/goal and then address these questions one by one. Our goal is to discover a subset of the training samples that benefit the learning model (via influence functions to trim the samples that are a detriment to the model) and interpret where the benefits come from in the feature space (via CART regression). \n\n    - > Are the samples used in the training of the CART model a subset of the original training set for which the influence was estimated?\n\n        Yes, the reviewer is correct, we use an 80-20 split with the original samples (concatenated with their labels) for training the CART model that will then be used to predict the influence value. \n\n    - > Since we know that the influence score measures the effect of up(down)weighting the training sample, alone, we also know that the label should not have any effect on predictive quality of the tree. What is the point of then concatenating the label?\n\n        The label implicitly contributes to the computation of the influence function. Since the influence function estimation utilizes the gradient of the loss term $l$, which takes in as input both $x_i$ (training sample) and $y_i$ (class label), the label also contributes to the influence computation. This is evident in Eqs. (1-3) in our paper and Eq. (2) in Koh and Liang's paper, where they use $z_i$ which is a tuple = $(x_i, y_i)$. This is why we concatenate the label for influence estimation.""}}, {'summary': {'value': ""This paper presents two schemes for 1) identifying the effect of a training point on a function of a model's parameters, and 2) trimming the training set to stem the influence of training instances that have a high negative influence on the test metric of interest.

I think the authors miss discussing retraining. I assume that the authors are referring to a model retrained after a subset of examples are deleted? So in Fig. 2, x axis==zero is a model trained on all data points? Then you trim a percent of the training samples and then retrain a model on the new dataset? If yes, is it the original model that is used for deciding which samples to trim or is the model changing? \n\n- **What is the motivation behind the cart regression procedure?**: As it stands it seems the cart procedure takes as input $(x_i, y_i)$, and the predicts some influence score per example? More details could be useful here. Are the samples used in the training of the cart model a subset of the original training set for which the influence was estimated? Since we know that the influence score measures the effect of up(down)weighting the training sample, alone, we also know that the label should not have any effect on predictive quality of the tree. What is the point of then concatenating the label? It seems like the goal here is to estimate the effect of a feature on the performance metric of interest. I take this judging from Figure 1 where the authors plot performance metric vs features that is colored by influence. If the goal is really to determine the effect of a feature on the performance metric of interest, then how to do that is already in section 2.2 of the original Koh and Liang paper. If the goal is not to measure the effect of the feature on the influence score, then I am not sure I understand the point of this section. Another point here is that in the rest of the paper, the trimming-based approach is really what the authors use and not the cart procedure. If this is the case, I don't think we can that as a contribution of this work.

Due to often competing utilities,  for example, key features and samples for fairness might not necessarily be the same for accuracy, and in most cases might have a negative influence. It would be interesting to see an interplay of various utilities. \n  - Although authors use several datasets, all of them are binary settings.

LLMs become more than mere applications, evolving into assistants capable of addressing diverse user requests. This narrows the distinction between human beings and artificial intelligence agents, raising intriguing questions regarding the potential manifestation of personalities, temperaments, and emotions within LLMs. In this paper, we propose a framework, PsychoBench, for evaluating diverse psychological aspects of LLMs. Comprising thirteen scales commonly used in clinical psychology, PsychoBench further classifies these scales into four distinct categories: personality traits, interpersonal relationships, motivational tests, and emotional abilities. Our study examines five popular models, namely text-davinci-003, ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA-2-7b, and LLaMA-2-13b. Additionally, we employ a jailbreak approach to bypass the safety alignment protocols and test the intrinsic natures of LLMs. We have made PsychoBench openly accessible via https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/PsychoBench.",Oral 7D,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H3UayAQWoE,https://openreview.net/forum?id=H3UayAQWoE,H3UayAQWoE,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'This paper presents an intriguing and significant contribution to the field of Large Language Models through the development of PPBench, a framework that bridges artificial intelligence, psychology, and social science.

The application of psychometric techniques to evaluate LLMs\' capabilities like emotion recognition and empathy is both original and relevant. The paper is well-articulated and contributes to the ongoing discourse in AI ethics and LLM evaluation. However, there are noteworthy concerns. The comparison of LLM performance to an ""average human population"" is problematic due to biases and small sample sizes in human benchmarks. The prompt design used in the study is also oversimplified, potentially limiting the depth and nuance of LLM responses.

Addressing the imminent challenges of superintelligence alignment: OpenAI recently posted a blog [7] mentioning the potential danger brought by the soon-coming superintelligence. The community now lacks control of AI systems that are much smarter than us. They put the problem to âthe core technical challenges of superintelligence alignment in four yearsâ. Our paper explores the psychological aspects of LLMs, which could contribute to a deeper understanding of their behaviors and inspire novel methods for managing superintelligent systems, aligning with the core technical challenges discussed in the blog post.\n2. Investigating latent representations in LLMs: The personalities exhibited by LLMs are derived from the representations they learn during training. By employing our proposed framework, PPBench, we provide a novel approach to probe these latent representations and analyze the impact of the training data on the models\' behavior. This investigation aligns with ICLR\'s focus on understanding and improving learning representations in AI systems.\n3. Interdisciplinary relevance and contribution to LLM research: Our paper addresses an essential topic in evaluating LLMs\' behavior through the application of psychometric techniques. As Reviewer Rgnn commented: âThis paper addresses an important topic in the evaluation of LLMs\' ""behavior"" through the use of psychometric techniques. It follows from previous technical work, but also important interdisciplinary discussions on the ability of LLM to demonstrate human-like behavior on a number of issues ranging from emotion recognition to empathy (affective or Theory of Mind). In that sense, the work is relevant to LLM research and, in view of the role of representational aspects of LLM in the emergence of such behavior, should also be relevant to ICLR.â\n\nWe believe that our research contributes valuable insights and opens up new avenues for understanding, evaluating, and controlling the behavior of advanced AI systems.\n\n**Reference**:\n- [7] OpenAI. Introducing Superalignment. https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment\n\n> **Question 2**: temperature=0 is suspect. I get that this gives reproducibility, but given the paper was already doing good randomization and statistical testing. I don\'t feel like it would\'ve been that farfetched to just use a temperate of 0.01 across the board (to align with LLaMA 2 experiments) or even higher and just do several replications. The presented results currently are already not comparable across LLMs because of the different temperature used for LLaMA 2, why was this not done?\n\nWe set the temperature of LLMs to the minimum value for more deterministic responses. The GPT models accept the temperature to be 0, and the LLaMA 2 models run through Hugging Face transformers require the temperature to be larger than 0 so we set it to 0.01.\n\nWe follow the Reviewerâs advice to conduct supplementary experiments with a temperature of 0.01 on gpt-3.5-turbo to make a fair comparison across LLMs. Besides, we also include another group of experiments with a temperature of 0.8, the default temperature of the official OpenAI Chat API, to examine whether a higher temperature has an influence on the performance of LLMs. The results for the Big Five Inventory (BFI) scale are listed as follows: \n\n| Models | llama2-7b (temp=0.01) | llama2-13b (temp=0.01) | gpt-3.5-turbo (temp=0) | gpt-3.5-turbo (temp=0.01) | gpt-3.5-turbo (temp=0.8) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Openness | 4.24 $\\pm$ 0.27 | 4.13 $\\pm$ 0.45 | 4.15 $\\pm$ 0.32 | 4.17 $\\pm$ 0.31 | 4.23 $\\pm$ 0.26 |\n| Conscientiousness | 3.89 $\\pm$ 0.28 | 4.41 $\\pm$ 0.35 | 4.28 $\\pm$ 0.33 | 4.24 $\\pm$ 0.28 | 4.14 $\\pm$ 0.18 |\n| Extraversion | 3.62 $\\pm$ 0.20 | 3.94 $\\pm$ 0.38 | 3.66 $\\pm$ 0.20 | 3.79 $\\pm$ 0.24 | 3.69 $\\pm$ 0.17 |\n| Agreeableness | 3.83 $\\pm$ 0.37 | 4.74 $\\pm$ 0.27 | 4.37 $\\pm$ 0.18 | 4.21 $\\pm$ 0.13 | 4.21 $\\pm$ 0.21 |\n| Neuroticism | 2.70 $\\pm$ 0.42 | 1.95 $\\pm$ 0.50 | 2.29 $\\pm$ 0.38 | 2.25 $\\pm$ 0.23 | 2.09 $\\pm$ 0.20 |\n\nAs seen, we cannot observe significant differences when using different values of temperature.

The human benchmarks in most cases are rather weak because of their locale/cultural biases and small sample sizes, e.g. ""six high schools in China"" for BFI, ""undergraduate psychology students from the United States"" for DTDD, or ""Hong Kong students"" in ICB. All of these are taken from seminal works (Table 6) are they aren\'t the only the studies that use each of the scales, so I think scales themselves are okay especially when considered as an array; however, the interpretation of experimental results then becomes much weaker because of these biases and small-N in the human benchmarks. I think the authors did make an honest attempt about being transparent about the demographic distributions in the Appendix, but in the main paper discussion I think the claims are still overreach and/or require additional caveats.\n\nWe appreciate the Reviewerâs acknowledgment of our transparency in providing demographic information in the Appendix. We believe that being transparent about such information is crucial for the scientific community to build upon our findings and improve future research. \n\nRegarding the sample size. For each scale, the sample size is reasonably adequate. As shown in Table 6 of the Appendix, all groups have over 300 samples except for BSRI, which is usually considered large enough in psychological research suggested by Boateng et al. [1] (pp. 8) and Clark et al. [2] (pp. 314). \n\nRegarding the different demographic groups. We follow your suggestions to claim our conclusions more carefully. We will state in the introduction section that the âaverage human normâ in this study refers to some specific human populations rather than representative samples of global data.\n\n**Reference**:\n- [1] GO Boateng, TB Neilands, EA Frongillo, HR Melgar-QuiÃ±onez, SL Young.

Do things break otherwise? Such a persona prompt may already implies certain caveats on psychological portrayal conclusions, e.g. only when an LLM is ""acting"" like a ""helpful persona"" is a ""empathic"" as defined/measured by the EIS, WLEIS, and ES.\n\nWe followed the recommendations provided in the OpenAI Cookbook [3] to use the prompt ""You are a helpful assistant,"". This particular system prompt has been widely adopted in various applications, including basic examples [4], Azure-related implementations [5], and vector database examples [6]. Consequently, we opted to follow this widely accepted setting in our experiments.\n\nIt is indeed interesting to examine the potential impact of this ""helpful persona"" on our evaluation results. In accordance with the Reviewer\'s advice, we conducted supplementary experiments by excluding the ""helpful assistant"" prompt. The outcomes for gpt-3.5-turbo on EIS, WLEIS, and ES are presented below, with no significant deviation from the results obtained with the ""helpful assistant"" prompt.

This is of particular importance when comparing to work such as Safdari et al. [2023] (in the paper's references) whose methodology might appear more sophisticated than the direct application of questionnaires in this paper.\n\nIn Section 5, we have reviewed previous research in this field, which is limited in either the diversity of psychological facets or the capability of LLMs. The most related study comes from Safdari et al. [2023], as exemplified by the Reviewer, which however focuses on different aspects from that of our study. \n\nSpecifically, Safdari et al. [2023] proposed a sophisticated method for verifying the construct validity of scales designed for humans on LLMs. This is a basic and important step before conducting psychological analyses of LLMs using these scales. \nOur study pays more attention to a comprehensive framework for depicting LLMsâ psychological portrayal. The study by Safdari et al. [2023] serves as substantial support for us to cover more scales from diverse aspects. Besides, we adopted LLaMA 2 and ChatGPT, which represented the state-of-the-art open-source and black-box LLMs respectively at the time of paper submission. These LLMs exhibited much stronger potential in human-like intelligence than previous LLMs, which are more suitable for the study of psychological portrayal. In addition, we also consider the impact of safety alignment on LLMs and leverage the jailbreak method to reveal the nature of GPT-4, which has not been explored by previous research in this field. \n\n> **Weakness 2a**: There is no real discussion of the work limitations, either in terms of actual results and findings, or in terms of the overall framework. \n\nWe follow the Reviewerâs advice to add a section discussing the limitations of this paper, including the results, findings, and the proposed framework. The details are shown below and also included in the updated PDF:\n\nWhile we aim to conduct a comprehensive framework for analyzing the psychological portrayal of LLMs, there are other aspects that can further improve our study.\n\n1. The proposed framework focuses mainly on Likert scales, without the support of other psychological analysis methods such as rank order, sentence completion, construction method, etc. We mainly use Likert scales because they yield quantifiable responses, facilitating straightforward data analysis and reducing bias and ambiguity associated with cognitive or cultural backgrounds by offering numerical response options, which allows for comparison of data from participants with diverse backgrounds and abilities. We leave the exploration of diverse psychological analysis methods on LLMs as one of the future work.\n\n2. The human results compared in this study are from different demographic groups. Obtaining representative samples of global data is challenging in psychological research, due to the heterogeneity and vastness of the global population, widespread geographical dispersion, economic constraints, etc. Moreover, simply adding up data from different articles is not feasible. To alleviate the influence, we select results with a wide range of population as much as possible to improve the representativeness. However, when applying our framework to evaluate LLMs, users should be aware that the comparison to human norms is from different demographic groups. We leave the collection of comprehensive global data a future direction to improve our framework.\n\n> **Weakness 2b**: âIn particular considering the latter, it seems questionable that all psychometric aspects of LLM could be considered as equally relevant or justifiable. For instance, emotional competence of LLM (see e.g., Elyoseph et al. [2023]) can be attributed technically to their sentiment analysis ability and, in terms of training data, could be attributed to various sources (including fiction). In the specific case of empathy, it might be appropriate to distinguish between emotional competence and Theory of Mind. For the latter, it is mentioned in Bubeck et al. [2023] (in the paper's references) that GPT-4 has some ToM abilities in particular that of passing a modified version of the Sally Anne test (modified to ensure non inclusion in the training dataset). There was no real discussion on this aspect, not least in relation to the training base in case it includes fiction, following the hypothesized impact of fiction on empathic abilities [Kidd and Castano, 2013].

We address your remaining concerns as follows:\n\n> 0\n\nApologies for missing the first part of your question earlier. In 3 (a), the observation we are relying on is that data points with a small number of features are much more likely to have very high confidence under the ensemble and vice versa. For a concrete example, it is much more likely for a data point with 0.8 confidence to have 25 features than a data point with 0.4 confidence to have 25 features. As such, we believe that itâs fair to say that data with fewer features tend to have higher confidence. For 3(c), we claim that the more features the models share, the lower bound on their shared errors becomes higher, which can be clearly observed in the figure. This *does not* mean that the fewer features the models share, their shared errors would necessarily be smaller. Instead, both models would make random guesses (recall that we make similar assumptions in the conceptual model). This means that a pair of models can have a high or low amount of shared errors due to randomness, but the lower bound on the shared error will become higher if they share more features. We believe that the figure supports this claim.\n\n> 1\n\nThank you for clarifying what you meant about the limitations. We agree with your assessment of NTK and shallow neural networks, and we absolutely agree that we should be transparent with the limitations of the framework. Appendix D.3 (previously D.4) is meant to discuss the limitations of the model but we see that it may not be as clear as we hoped. As such, we have expanded Appendix D.3 to be more explicit about these limitations. This was already referred to at the beginning of section 5 where we introduced the model and in the conclusion, but once again, due to space limits, we could not include them in the main text.\n\n> 2\n\nThank you for clarifying this and pointing out the notation issues. We have streamlined the notations in Section 3 for better clarity so the footnotes are no longer needed.\n\nSpecifically, we have changed to use $C$ for the number of classes instead of $K$ and use $K$ to denote the number of top principal components, so all capital letters refer to a fixed number (e.g., $N$ for the total number of data, $M$ for the number of models, etc). Lower case of $N,M,K,T$ will refer to a particular index for what the object the capital letters refer to, so $k$ will always refer to the feature, $m$ will always refer to the model and $n$ will always refer to data, etc.\n\nOne exception is the k-partite graph. Since this is the standard reference to the problem we use $\\mathtt{k}$ to differentiate it.\nAnother one is that $i,j, a, b$ are used instead of $m$ and $k$ to refer to a pair of models and features around equation 2.\nWe believe that this should resolve the ambiguity but if there are any concerns regarding the notation left please let us know.\n\nRegarding the table of notation, we fully agree that a table would be great to have. Unfortunately, so far we have not been able to find a way to squeeze it into the text.

Am I missing something? How does the choice of the thresholds affect your observations?"". Can the authors please clarify on this?\n\n1- When NTK was first introduced, it was obvious that it is a first order Taylor series expansion around initialization (that is accurate in the infinite width regime) and it was obvious that adding more terms will make it more realistic (but maybe harder -- or much harder -- to analyze).\n\nAlso, when people study shallow neural networks (or infinitely deep neural networks), the assumptions that they make is explainable. We know what aspects they are missing out on. We know that they need to add more layers, we know the training procedure is very specialized, etc. However, this is not the case for your model. I am not sure what your assumptions/simplifications are to the real problem. \n\nThis is a limitation of the current work.

In this case, since the resulting framework is still useful for understanding empirical phenomena, we feel the assumptions are justified. \n\n> The framework is less useful for understanding the learning process of networksâ¦\n\nThis is correct.

We have indeed considered the possibility of modeling it as a spectrum, which we discussed in Appendix D.1 and D.4. In our preliminary investigation, we found that modeling the feature spectrum may require introducing more free parameters (e.g., Zipfâs distribution), and can drastically increase the complexity of analysis. Given that this is our first foray into the topic, we opted for the simpler binary model. This is an important problem and we plan to explore it in more detail in future works.\n\nWe hope these responses have addressed some of the questions and we are open to further discussion.

Perhaps ârudimentaryâ is not the best description. We have revised the phrase to be âstill in early developmentâ to better convey the sentiment. However, we do feel that it is reasonable to say that we still have much to understand about feature learning. \n\nTo briefly address the specific works you mentioned: these models generally assume the input data are isotropic Gaussian and the function class is a 2 layer MLP. The feature is usually a linear function of the input and often special training algorithms are needed (e.g., layer-wise training). A notable exception is [3] which learns non-linear features but still requires layer-wise training. \nMost of these works are quite recent (and all came out after we started this project): [3,4,5] showed up in October 2023 and [2] was updated in November 2023. In general, it is hard to say how well they encapsulate the full complexity of deep learning, or how feasible it is to apply them to modern architectures and datasets. Nonetheless, the goal of this work is not to compare existing theoretical works on the topic or discuss their merits and shortcomings, but rather to identify what realistic (perhaps strong) modeling assumptions to make when studying feature learning. Given the recently increasing interest in the subject, we view these works and our approach as complementary components of a broader exploration into feature learning. We have added a discussion of these works to Appendix D.1, but would be happy to revise them if you have further suggestions.\n\nWe hope these responses address your concerns and we are open to further discussion.

We are glad that you find the problem we study timely and important. Below are our responses to your concerns:\n\n> I definitely agree with ""the empirical phenomena of deep learning can be understood at many different layers of abstraction"". However, I think the model proposed in this paper is too simplisticâ¦\n\nWe definitely agree that our model is unconventional and more abstract than most existing works but similar assumptions have been made in prior work [6]. As is the case for all theoretical models, simplifications are required to keep analysis tractable. Despite the simplification, our model already exhibits some interesting behaviors and offers insight into empirical phenomena so we believe that it adds value to the current discussion on feature learning. \n\nIn the case of random feature models, we feel that it is a little unfair to say in hindsight that there was a very obvious way to move towards making it more realistic. When NTK first came out in 2018, it was thought to be very promising. Indeed, despite its simplification, it offers clear value in the analysis of some phenomena in deep networks. However, it only later became clear that there was a big gap between NTK and real deep learning (despite many efforts to close this gap). More recent works (many of which you already brought up) rely on quite distinct analysis tools than those used in NTK and, still, itâs not clear if any of them is close to real-world practice.  As such, while we agree (and have acknowledged in Section 5, Appendix D.1 and D.4) that there is a gap between our proposed framework and practice, we feel itâs a tall order for the current state of deep learning theory to have no strong assumptions.  Just like NTK analysis, we hope that our approach will ultimately prove valuable (albeit along different dimensions), despite its simplicity.\n\n> Although the model is based on some observations using the interaction tensor, I still find the model to be not very well motivated. Any insights on how this can relate to the training of deep nets?\n\nThe primary goal of our work is to investigate the effect of different features being learned by different models on GDE and the calibration of deep ensembles, both of which are robust empirical observations. While our model does not directly provide insights into training, understanding these feature interactions may indirectly inform training strategies in the future. For example, [6] shows potential avenues for how observations like ours may transfer to training.\n\n> It is not very clear how the authors set the hyperparameters in their model (e.g., the thresholds).\n\nAs detailed in Appendix F.10 (referred to at the end of Section 4), our conclusions are robust across a range of parameter settings so we believe that the settings used in our paper should be appropriate for most situations.\n\n> The notations are a bit confusing ($i, j, k$, etc.). I suggest authors avoid using these generic letters. Also, the paper will benefit greatly from a figure that summarizes all the notations ($p_d, p_r$, etc.). It will also help explain the method.\n\nWe apologize for the confusion. There is already a centralized list of notations in Appendix A which we could not include in the main text due to space constraints (this is referred to in the second paragraph of section 5). Beyond this, could you be more specific about where the $i,j,k$ are causing confusion so we could better address the confusion? $i,j,k$ are used to denote an arbitrary member of the ordered collection so we feel this is in accordance with the standard usage.\n\n> But the model is very abstract/high-level and I\'m not sure if the assumptions that they make are stronger or weaker than calibration.\n\nWe want to clarify that we *do not* claim that the assumptions we make are weaker than calibration (since neither is a clear superset of the other), but we do believe that it sheds more light on the underlying reasons behind GDE. Only stating the model is calibrated does not tell us much about the model or the data, but our assumptions do. In fact, our framework tells us how one can break our assumption (and calibration) through data distribution interventions. Of course, it is an important open question why so many natural distributions seem to satisfy these assumptions.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer PxMC'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the support of our paper!

We believe our framework can accommodate distribution shifts. For instance, the simplest form of covariate shift one could introduce is to add a new set of features that are not present in the training data with some probability at test time. Since the model has not seen these new features during training, we may assume that individual members of the ensemble will make random predictions (but the prediction of different models will be correlated) if the data points only contain the new features (the same assumption for features that the models did not learn). One can also introduce a covariate shift on existing features but that would require imposing a non-uniform distribution over the existing features.

Prior methods using language models have demonstrated promising results, but they still struggle to prove even middle school level theorems. One common limitation of these methods is that they assume a fixed theorem library during the whole theorem proving process. However, as we all know, creating new useful theorems or even new theories is not only helpful but crucial and necessary for advancing mathematics and proving harder and deeper results. In this work, we present LEGO-Prover, which employs a growing skill library containing verified lemmas as skills to augment the capability of LLMs used in theorem proving. By constructing the proof modularly, LEGO-Prover enables LLMs to utilize existing skills retrieved from the library and to create new skills during the proving process. These skills are further evolved (by prompting an LLM) to enrich the library on another scale. Modular and reusable skills are constantly added to the library to enable tackling increasingly intricate mathematical problems. Moreover, the learned library further bridges the gap between human proofs and formal proofs by making it easier to impute missing steps. LEGO-Prover advances the state-of-the-art pass rate on miniF2F-valid (48.0\% to 57.0\%) and miniF2F-test (45.5\% to 50.0\%). During the proving process, LEGO-Prover also generates over 20,000 skills (theorems/lemmas) and adds them to the growing library. Our ablation study indicates that these newly added skills are indeed helpful for proving theorems, resulting in a 4.9\% improvement in success rate",Oral 8C,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=3f5PALef5B,https://openreview.net/forum?id=3f5PALef5B,3f5PALef5B,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'Great paper, introducing a few novel ideas in the space of Theorem Proving in Lean.

As these incorrect lemmas accumulate, the performance of the prover is affected by the faulty lemmas provided.\n\nWe apologize for not explaining this earlier. The absence of the `miniF2F-test (model informal proof)` and the incorrect values in the `miniF2F-test (human informal proof)` were primarily due to technical issues. These issues were more engineering-related, which is why they were not detailed in our initial explanation. Specifically, we ran the LEGO-Prover results on a powerful machine equipped with 1TB of RAM. The Isabelle verifier uses a significant amount of RAM, consuming up to 700GB with 44 parallel processes. Unfortunately, our powerful machine underwent maintenance before the submission deadline, resulting in the loss of our `miniF2F-test (model informal proof)` results. Consequently, we had to conduct our experiments on a less powerful machine with only 512GB of RAM. This led to some crashes of the Isabelle verifier due to insufficient RAM, and a bug in our original code mistakenly marked the false proof as correct when Isabelle crashed. As a result, many false lemmas were added to the skill library. Notably, the prover process itself is not buggy, as we use different functions to verify the code. These errors gradually accumulated, adversely affecting the prover's effectiveness. We identified this bug after the submission deadline, as we were curious about the relatively low-performance gain observed with the miniF2F-test. After correcting the code, we reran the experiment on the more powerful machine, achieving normal results of 45.5% with model-generated informal proofs and 50.0% with human-written informal proofs on the miniF2F-test.\n\nOne insight from this experience is the high sensitivity of LLMs to erroneous inputs. If errors are present, they can easily accumulate, significantly impacting the final results. Thus, it is crucial to ensure the accuracy of the data used for bootstrapping.""}}, {'comment': {'value': ""I thank the authors for the efforts to address my concerns.\nThe response makes me lean towards acceptance, but I'm a bit surprised that the success rate of LEGO-Prover with human proofs on miniF2F-test in Table 1 is updated from 47.1% to 50.0%.

I've revised my score to support acceptance. Overall, I feel that this is a meaningful contribution to a promising area â library learning for automated theorem proving.\n\nAddressing of weaknesses\n* (W1) Strength of results â\xa0I now feel they have fairly strong results. I also do agree with their argument that DSP is the natural comparison and not subgoal learning, and I appreciate the breakdown they gave around that. Also, the fact that they added a miniF2F-test evaluation for\xa0**LEGO-Prover (model proof)** was a key missing piece that I'm glad is there.\n* (W2) The method now achieves a 4.9% instead of 3.3% gain when they scaled up their ablation study to a full 100 samples, and the graph of this that they've included in the updated response is a nice addition. The newly added appendix study shows that when fixing the computational budget (tokens used) to be the same for the ablations and main experiments, the gain is 2.1%. I really appreciate this analysis â adjusting token budgets for ablations is something that isn't done nearly enough in LLM literature. It's good that their method still shows benefit when doing this.\n* (W3) The authors have clearly greatly improved the readability of the papers and figure. The addition of algorithm listings to the appendix is helpful, the color coding / labelling in the figure is much clearer, there's an added table of prompts, and there was significant rewriting throughout. I think that the clarity of the paper is significantly improved.\n\n**Q1-Q5** - I appreciate all these responses and they make sense, thank you.\n\n\n**Q6**\n> As described in Section 4.3.2, we manually examined all the correct solutions provided by LEGO-Prover in miniF2F-valid and calculated the number manually, instead of relying on any sort of computation of similarity.\n\nOh great â that makes sense and is better than what I had assumed.\n\n**Q7**\n\nThese are some interesting thoughts, thank you â but also sorry, I meant a different sort of frequency. I was wondering how many different proofs a single lemma is used in â say, the most-used lemma. For example, if some common lemma were used across 20 problems it would be 20 / 488. Or perhaps instead of frequency just a raw count would be fine, just for an idea of how many times these are being used. One could also potentially think about how to account for things like the evolution trees and lemmas used in proving other lemmas in this, since those ancestor lemmas and helper lemmas should get some credit for the downstream levels theyre evolved into or that they help prove.\n- However to be clear I don't expect this at all for this submission, I'm satisfied as is. I just think it's a useful analysis you may be interested in doing to help understand how general the lemmas are â how much the same lemma is being used in more than one place.\n\n**Future Work**. Just to add a little thought on future work. I'd be curious about future work that tries to refine down to the more general useful lemmas â 20k lemmas for 500 problems is an awful lot. Being able to distill down to some key lemmas that are general and useful seems desirable. I think that this is fine to leave to future work though.\n\nThank you again for an excellent discussion.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Updated results'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Dear reviewer oKSy:\n\nWe include a tabular presentation of the results here for enhanced clarity.

We hope our response and rebuttal revision will address your concerns.\n\nMany of the weaknesses you\'ve identified correspond directly to the questions you\'ve raised. To provide a cohesive and concise response, and to avoid repetition, we will address them simultaneously.\n\n## Weaknesses & Questions\n**W1Q1. Question on miniF2F split.**\n\nWe have adopted the approach outlined in \'Draft, Sketch, Prove\', and \'Subgoal-based Learning\' to present the performance of the miniF2F dataset on both the validation and test sets separately. Our method does not require training, and these two splits are actually treated identically by our approach. The separate display of results for each split is solely for the purpose of facilitating a more detailed comparison with previous methods\n\n**W2Q2. Performance gap between miniF2F-valid and miniF2F-test**\n\nWe have updated the performance of LEGO-Prover on the miniF2F-test set, which achieves a 50.0% pass rate on the miniF2F-test with human-written informal proofs and 45.5% with model-generated informal proofs.\nIt\'s important to note that the performance gap between the validation and test sets is not unique to our method. Similar performance gaps are observed in other methods, including ""Draft, Sketch, Prove"" (42.6% and 38.9%), ""Subgoal-based Learning"" (48.0% and 45.5%), and ""Hyper-tree Proof Search."" (47.5% and 40.6%). This gap is likely attributable to variations in problem difficulty between the two splits.\n\n**W3Q3. 100 proof attempts for the Subgoal-based Learning method.**\n\nThe paper ""Subgoal-based Learning"" by Zhao et al. (2023) does indeed utilize 100 proof attempts per problem. This can be verified by examining Figure 2 in their paper, where they demonstrate that the performance achieved with 100 sketches (proof attempts) corresponds to the 45.5% success rate reported in Table 1.\n\n**W4Q4. Missing cells in Table 1.**\n\nAs mentioned in our general response, we encountered technical issues that prevented us from producing the results on time. These problems have been resolved, and we have completed Table 1 accordingly. For the result of the ablation study in the miniF2F-test, we intentionally conducted the ablation only on the validation set to conserve our budget (we mentioned this setting in section 4.1 baseline methods).\n\n## Additional Questions\n\n**Q5. The performance gap between LEGO-Prover and the ablation becomes stable.**\n\nWe have extended our ablation setup to include 100 proving attempts per problem, where the LEGO-Prover achieves a success rate of 55.3% and the ablation setup achieves 50.4%. When compared to the previous 50-attempt setup, the performance gap has increased from 3.3% (LEGO-Prover 50.4%, ablation 47.1%) to 4.9%. We have also updated Figure 3(a) in our rebuttal revision to reflect these 100 attempts. It is evident from the figure that the LEGO-Prover\'s performance progressively improves in comparison to the ablation setup.\n\n**Q6(minors). Minor suggestions.**\n\nThank you for your valuable suggestions on improving the presentation of our paper. We have significantly improved our figures and captions as well as the overall writing in this rebuttal revision, striving to make each figure and its explanation as clear as possible within the space constraints.

Computational cost of skill library.**\n\nWe have included an additional section in Appendix A.3 in our rebuttal revision to discuss the computational cost of the evolver and we run additional experiments on ablation, validating the effectiveness of our growing skill library. The results are detailed as follows:\n- The average token consumption ratio is 1:0.89 for the prover and evolver. Therefore, we conducted an additional 100 proving attempts for the ablation setup, which approximates the tokens used by the evolver to those used by the prover. The results show that our method still outperforms the ablation setup by 2.1% under 189 proving attempts (the number of proving attempts with balanced computational cost). Thus, the extra tokens used for more attempts at solving the original problems do not close the gap. Furthermore, LEGO-Prover acquires a significantly large skill library containing various verified proofs, while the prover-only method only accumulates proved problems, which are of no use for other problems or any future applications.\n- As the proposer of the concept of utilizing a growing skill library in neural theorem proving, we also believe that this skill library represents the future of ATP. However, in our exploration of employing the skill library for theorem proving, we identified certain limitations that inevitably hinder the performance of the skill library's application in theorem proving. These limitations also contribute to increased token consumption by the evolver to maintain the skill library.\n  - **Limitations of LLMâs capabilities.** The LLM struggles to produce correct proofs, with the evolver's average proof success rate being only 24.1%. Moreover, the evolver might generate proofs that are either trivial or too similar to existing lemmas in the library. After filtering, an average of only 9.1% of the generated proofs are added to the lemma vector store. \n  - **The task of extracting useful lemmas applicable to other problems is challenging.** Identifying useful and non-trivial common lemmas for a specific problem set is difficult, even for humans. The LLM often yields lemmas that are either overly trivial or too specific, lacking generality.\n  - **Characteristics of the dataset.** The miniF2F dataset, comprising only 488 problems, includes many that are simple enough to solve without additional lemmas. Others may require unique solving techniques, not sharing common intermediate lemmas.\n\n  Thus, the 4.9% performance gap is not easily attainable. There are of course some promising future directions for exploration, such as improving the performance of the directional transformer, enhancing the accuracy of the request solver, and increasing retrieval efficiency, all of which present potential avenues for reducing these additional computational costs. However, as the first work to utilize a skill library in neural theorem proving and propose the use of a block-by-block manner for theorem proof, we believe our paper already makes a significant contribution.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer SGTy Part 1/2'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thanks for your detailed and helpful comments.

You are invited to review all the revisions we have made in the general response.\n\n**W2. Fairness of comparison to the baseline.**\n\nWe adhered to ""Draft, Sketch, and Prove"" and ""Subgoal-based Learning"" papers to include Thor, Thor+expert iteration, and Draft, Sketch, and Prove as baselines for comparison. These methods represent the state-of-the-art in the miniF2F benchmark for the Isabelle theorem prover. Specifically, Thor and Thor+expert iteration utilizes a fine-tuned, small language model (770 million parameters), demonstrating the performance of search-based neural theorem proving methods. The LLM employed in Thor+expert iteration is only used for auto-formalizing additional problem statements used for data augmentation.\n\nIn the ""Draft, Sketch, and Prove"" approach, GPT-3.5 achieves approximate results of 41.8% and 38.5% on the miniF2F validation and test sets, respectively, as reported in the ablation study of the Subgoal-based Learning paper. By removing their proposed subgoal-based demonstration and diffusion re-ranking components, the Subgoal-based Learning method becomes nearly identical to Draft, Sketch, and Prove, thereby providing an approximate performance benchmark for DSP runs on GPT-3.5. LEGO-Prover significantly outperforms these results.\n\n**W3.

Request for pseudo code.**\n\nThank you for your valuable suggestions on improving the presentation of our paper. We have included a detailed description of the LEGO-Prover algorithm in Appendix A.2 in our rebuttal revision.\n\n## Questions\n**Q1. Question on request vector store.**\n\nYour understanding is correct: the request vector store maintains a list of conjectured statements proposed by the decomposer. There is a possibility that these proposed statements could be incorrect, and the evolver will attempt to prove them if they are selected. However, these incorrect conjectures definitely cannot be proven and will be rejected by the Isabelle theorem prover. We have integrated a simple grammar check with the Isabelle theorem prover to filter out grammatically incorrect conjectured statements. For other statements that are correct grammatically, there are no trivial ways to filter them out, since disproving a conjecture is an unpredictable problem. To our knowledge, methods like those described in Yutaka et al. (2018) can reject simple conjectures, but we consider exploring these methods as part of our future work.\n\n**Q2. Problem statements used in evolver.**\n\nIn the directional transformer, we retrieve relevant problem statements using the selected lemma generated by the formalizer or the directional transformer itself. These problem statements are used as reference problems and are added to the prompt to guide the LLM in generating new skills. By presenting the problem and explicitly instructing the LLM to try to evolve the skill that would help solve the problem, the LLM is directed to produce new skills that are more helpful in solving these specific problems, rather than generating arbitrary skills.\n\n**Q3. Explanations on minimally solved requests.**\n\nLEGO-Prover maintains a list of lemma statements within the request vector store. Each statement is associated with a specific counter that records the number of times it has been selected to solve by the request solver. When attempting to address a request, we prioritize those with the lowest solve count. In cases where multiple requests share the minimal solve count (e.g., 0), we randomly select one of these to solve.\n\n**Q4. Explanations on reference examples in request solver.**\n\nThe term \'server as a reference\' might be too vague to elucidate how these retrieved skills are utilized in the request solver. We have reformulated the retrieved lemma into in-context learning (ICL) examples, which helps to prompt the large language model (LLM) to solve the selected request. A detailed usage example can be seen in Figure 7 in Appendix B.  We have improved our expression in the paper to make this clearer and more illustrative.\n\n**Q5. Open-source request.**\n\nYes, we will release our code after the anonymous review period.\n\n**Q6(minor). Minor suggestions.**\n\nWe have incorporated the temple-based lemma conjecturing into the related work section in our revised rebuttal and corrected the reference errors on pages 5 and 8.\n\n**References:**\n\n>[1] Nagashima, Yutaka, and Julian Parsert.

LEGO-Prover* technically equals the result of 200 proving attempts. We included this performance merely for demonstration purposes. \n\n\n**Q2. Entry for LEGO-Prover (model informal proof) in miniF2F-test.**\n\nWe encountered some technical issues before submission, so the results in the miniF2F-test were either buggy or lost. We have updated the results for the miniF2F-test afterward. LEGO-Prover achieves 45.5% on model-generated informal proofs and 50.0% on human-written informal proofs.\n\n**Q3. Ablation explanation.**\n\nThe ablation study runs with a human-written informal proof. Specifically, the prover functions as usual, but we ignore the requests provided by the decomposer and supply an empty list of reference skills to the formalizer. Consequently, the evolver is not utilized in this setup. Additionally, the autocorrect sledgehammer is also employed in the ablation setup.\n- The ablation that directly produces the final proof actually degrades to DSP, with different prompt instructions. Due to a limited budget, we have not explored this ablation setup.\n\n**Q4. Prover procedure question.**\n\nYes, in each of the 100 passes, LEGO-Prover runs the Decomposer once and then the Formalizer once on each problem. For a clearer algorithmic description, please refer to Appendix A.2 in our rebuttal revision.\n\n**Q5. Evolver procedure question.**\n\nFor how the evolver calls to the `request solver` and the `directional transformer`. As detailed in Algorithm 3 in Appendix A.2, when a call to the evolver is initiated, the evolver randomly selects either the `request solver` or the `directional transformer` to perform its task. Consequently, each pass of the evolver will utilize only one of these options.\n\n**Q6. Question on skill usage.**\n\nAs you mentioned, measuring the assistance that the retrievals provided in the prompt offer to generation under the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm is a challenging task. Therefore, we adopted a manual inspection method rather than an automated computational approach to judge the help provided by the lemma in the prompt to the formalizer. We only consider the extracted lemma to contribute to the formalizer if it is copied verbatim in the proof or if it provides a rewrite in a similar manner. This is in line with the two types of contributions mentioned in the paper. Other scenarios, where the generation results are irrelevant to the retrievals, are not considered as \'used to formulate new lemmas\'. As described in Section 4.3.2, we manually examined all the correct solutions provided by LEGO-Prover in miniF2F-valid and calculated the number manually, instead of relying on any sort of computation of similarity.\n\n**Q7. Lemma usage frequency in created skill library.**\n\nRegarding how skills from the library are used in correctly solved problems, we have a detailed analysis in Section 4.3.2. As for the individual lemma usage frequency in the generated skill library, due to the small number of problems in miniF2F and the large number of skills generated (we generated more than 20,000 theorems while there are only 488 problems in miniF2F. Even if EVERY problem uses one generated skill, this would only result in a frequency of 488 / 20,000 â 2.4%), the usage frequency remains low in our approach. We justify this as follows:\n- Our objective in evolving theorems is not to solve the specific problems presented in the miniF2F dataset, but rather to enhance their mathematical value for more general purposes, such as through the parameterization process. Consequently, the outcomes of the evolution may not necessarily be adequately reflected in the proof tests of miniF2F. In Appendix C, we provide examples of theorems that have evolved, demonstrating their general mathematical significance without considering their relevance to the selected miniF2F problems.\n- Increasing lemma usage frequency calls for a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-style system with usage frequency as feedback/reward. The strategies for the evolver in this work are hard-coded in the prompt and are mainly based on human intuition. No adjustment is integrated into the whole library learning process yet. And even if some of these strategies encourage the reusability of the generated theorems, there is no guarantee that the backbone LLM really follows the instruction in the intended direction (which requires a deep understanding of mathematical research). We think it is a very promising avenue to incorporate an RL-style system to dynamically learn the notion of ""usefulness"" for generated theorems/skills. This was already part of our plan for future research before this submission.\n\n**References:**\n\n>[1] Zheng, Chuanyang, et al.

The results are detailed as follow:\n\n- We have extended the number of proving attempts for ablations of LEGO-Prover without a skill library to **100** proving attempts (up from 50). The results show that the gap between using the skill library and not using it gradually and consistently enlarges. The initial 3.3% performance gap increases to **4.9%** when the LEGO-Prover reaches 100 proving attempts. Thus, the advantage of the growing skill library will become more apparent as the number of skills in the library increases.\n- ""Simply using all those extra tokens for more attempts at solving the original problems would likely provide a lot of benefits and could conceivably close the 3.3% gap."" In response, we conducted an additional experiment to disprove this (Detailed in Appendix A.3 in our rebuttal revision). Specifically, the average token consumption ratio is 1:0.89 for the prover and evolver. Therefore, we conducted an additional 100 proving attempts for the ablation setup, which approximates the tokens used by the evolver to those used by the prover. The results (Figure 5 in A.3) show that our method still outperforms the ablation setup by **2.1%** under 189 proving attempts (the number of proving attempts with balanced computational cost).

Comparison to the baseline is not very strong.**\n- Subgoal-based Learning (Zhao et al., 2023) indeed uses model-generated proofs. However, Subgoal-based Learning is an approach that is specifically optimized for model-generated proofs. In contrast, our approach focuses on the usage of a skill library and block-by-block formalization, all based on **human informal proofs** (as is the case for DSP). We do not extensively explore methods of model-generated proof in LEGO-Prover, as this task is more pertinent to Math Word Problems and not the primary focus of our work. We have outlined the differences in handling model-generated proofs between LEGO-Prover and Subgoal-based Learning in the table below. Each row is explained in detail in the following:\n  \n\n  |          | LEGO-Prover | Subgoal-based Learning |\n  | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n  | Pass rate     | The **52.4%** produced by LEGO-Prover is **NOT** a cumulative pass rate.      | The **48%** **IS** a cumulative pass rate that integrates the pass rates from both the data collection stage and the inference stage.     |\n  | Demonstration examples | Decomposer produces the step-by-step proof directly on top of the informal proof. Only **20** demonstration examples come with DSP used for Decomposer and Formalizer. | The step-by-step informal proof undergoes 15 iterations of refinement using a cross-verification strategy, culminating in **61** demonstration examples to prove the theorem. |\n  |Number of model-generated informal proofs | Use up to 20 model-generated informal proofs per problem (on average **12.13**) | Use **100** model-generated step-by-step informal proofs per problem\n  \n  In conclusion, the Subgoal-based method is actually orthogonal to our approach. The novel approaches proposed by Subgoal-based Learning, such as subgoal-based demonstration and diffusion re-ranking, are both directly applicable to LEGO-Prover without any conflict. We believe this will definitely improve our results with model-informed proof and further enhance our approach. Unfortunately, Subgoal-based Learning has not been open-sourced to date.\n- We believe that a more accurate and direct comparison would involve DSP with model informal proof runs on ChatGPT. An approximate result would be the ablation outcome for the Subgoal-based Learning method, which yields **41.8%**(miniF2F-valid) and **38.5%**(miniF2F-test). By removing their proposed subgoal-based demonstration and diffusion re-ranking components, the Subgoal-based Learning method becomes nearly identical to Draft, Sketch, and Prove, thereby providing an approximate performance benchmark for DSP runs on GPT-3.5. In comparison to these figures, our LEGO-Prover achieves a notable improvement with **52.4%(+10.6%)** and **45.5%(+7.0%)** on valid set and test set with model-generated proof.\n- Another strong baseline is from the recently released paper ""Lyra"" [(Zheng et al., 2023)\\[1\\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15806), which was published after the submission deadline and therefore is not included in our paper. Lyra enhances DSP by letting GPT-4 to auto-correct the formal proof with the error message provided by Isabelle. As a result, Lyra achieved pass rates of **55.3%** and **51.2%** on the miniF2F validation and test sets, respectively, using human-written informal proofs and attempting each problem 200 times with **GPT-4**. In contrast, LEGO-Prover achieves pass rates of **55.3%** and **50.0%** with only 100 attempts using only **ChatGPT** (`gpt-3.5-turbo`). Thus, our pipeline, with a growing skill library, is able to achieve results comparable to GPT-4 using half the number of proving attempts with ChatGPT. We believe this is a remarkable achievement.\n- In response to your comments regarding `LEGO-Prover*`, your understanding is accurate.

However, the problem vector store is exclusively utilized in the Directional Transformer. It is employed for similarity searches to identify potentially relevant problems that the selected lemma might aid in solving. As for handling the unsolved problems in miniF2F for prover processes, we utilize a multi-processing shared queue that maintains a list of pending problems. A detailed description is added in Appendix A.2.\n\nClarification 2: ""Concurrently with each pass through the dataset, for every 3 Problem Store problems attempted it makes 8 Request Store attempts, where an attempt is either a call to the Request Solver LLM or the Directional Evolution LLM, or perhaps both (please help clarify, thanks)."".\nAs shown in Algorithm 1 in Appendix A.2, we run the prover and evolver processes using the Python multiprocessing package, maintaining the number of processes at the ratio of 3:8. However, there is no synchronization mechanism among these processes except for a shared skill library. The time required for the prover to solve a problem, or for the evolver to transform (solve) a lemma (request), varies. Therefore, there is no guarantee that there will be 8 evolver attempts for every 3 prover attempts.\nFor how the evolver calls to the `request solver` and the `directional transformer`. As detailed in Algorithm 3, when a call to the evolver is initiated, the evolver randomly selects either the `request solver` or the `directional transformer` to perform its task.

The performance gap between LEGO-Prover and the ablation setup increased from 3.3% (50 attempts) to 4.9% (100 attempts).

It is instantiated as a system called LEGO-Prover for proofs in Isabelle and is evaluated on the miniF2F dataset. The approach is fairly complex so I've broken down my understanding of it below:\n\nThere are 3 vector stores used:\n- Problem Store: Holds (unsolved) problems from miniF2F. This is where new problems will be drawn from, and is also used at various other points to guide how lemmas are proposed/modified.\n- Request Store: Lemmas that have been proposed but not yet solved.\n- Lemma Store: Lemmas that have been solved.\n\nOuter loop (I'm less clear on this and have also included it in the Questions section):\n- There are 4 LLMs, described below, used in the solving loop.\n- LEGO-Prover makes 100 passes through the miniF2F dataset, and in each pass makes a single attempt at each problem in the dataset â i.e. it runs the Decomposer LLM once on that problem and Formalizer LLM once on that problem (correct me if I'm wrong).\n- Concurrently with each pass through the dataset, for every 3 Problem Store problems attempted it makes 8 Request Store attempts, where an attempt is either a call to the Request Solver LLM or the Directional Evolution LLM, or perhaps both (please help clarify, thanks).\n\nLLMs (all implemented as variants on GPT3.5):\n- The Decomposer LLM takes the formal statement (from Problem Store), informal statement, and informal proof (which is either given or is produced by the Informal Solver LLM) and outputs an informal step-by-step proof in natural language followed by a list of formal statements of lemmas that would be useful. These lemmas are added to the Request Store, where attempts will be made to solve them later, at which point they'll be moved to the Lemma Store.\n- The Formalizer LLM takes the step-by-step informal proof, the informal and formal problem statements, and the result of querying the Lemma Store for relevant lemmas, and attempts to produce a complete formal proof which itself may use the retrieved lemmas by copying them verbatim (from the prompt) or may riff on them or define new lemmas.

Comparison to baseline is not very strong**\n- In my understanding, the best-performing prior work **Subgoal-Learning (Zhao et al., 2023)** does not get the human written informal proof, so the natural comparison is between this baseline and **LEGO-Prover (model proof)**. The improvement on miniF2F-valid is from 48% to 52.4%, which is a 4.4% improvement. This is decent, but not huge given the complexity of the method and amount of additional LLM queries required (which could have been used just running more iterations of the other approach, for example).\n- Additionally, there\'s no comparison on miniF2F-test for **LEGO-Prover (model proof)** which seems important to include if following the above interpretation as the main result.\n- I also find one of the main results in the abstract misleading: the 48% to 57% improvement is actually between the baseline (which gets 100 attempts) and **LEGO-Prover-Star** which is a combination of **LEGO-Prover (model proof)** and **LEGO-Prover (human proof)** which in my understanding *each* get 100 attempts. This doesn\'t seem like a fair comparison since there\'s a combined 200 attempts used in **LEGO-Prover-Star**. (I\'m open to revising this if there\'s an explanation I\'m missing or I\'m misunderstanding the setup here of course).\n\n**2. Comparison to ablation is not very strong**\n- The ablation of the skill library changes the 50-attempt solution rate of the method on the validation set from 47.1% to 50.4%. This 3.3% solution rate gain is not much for the complexity of the proposed method. I like the idea of the skill library and I do believe that by experimenting with variations on the approach the authors can achieve greater results, but as-is the library doesn\'t seem to add much.\n- The library version must also involve far more and far larger queries to the LLM, given all of the lemmas included in prompts and the fact that for every 3 problem solving attempts there are 8 evolving attempts. Simply using all those extra tokens for more attempts at solving the original problems would likely provide a lot of benefit and could conceivably close the 3.3% gap (this could of course be disproven through an experiment, and would be a valuable thing to include).\n\n**3. Could use more details at certain points, and overall readability**\n- It took me a very long time to understand the method; in part this is just due to the many moving pieces, but I think the explanation itself could also be improved and I\'ll do my best to lay out some of my confusions/thoughts which I hope will help the authors.\n    - I think that presenting the top level algorithm loop first would greatly improve this: that LEGO-Prover makes 100 passes through the miniF2F dataset and in each pass makes a single attempt at each problem in the dataset using the Solver (which is composed of two pieces: Decomposer and Formalizer). And that *concurrently*, for every 3 problems attempted it makes 8 attempts at solving any pending Lemmas that are proposed but unsolved (and also it calls the Directional Transformer to evolve them? Though I\'m unclear on how much that is called relative to the Request Solver). A very high level schematic and brief description early on could be helpful for this â as is, I found myself trying to understand the 4 pieces (Decomposer, Formalizer, Request Solver, Directional Transformer) somewhat independently only to find later that there\'s this larger 100 pass cycle split into two concurrent processes, which came as a surprise around page 6 (until then I was just unsure when the lemmas got evolved/proved during this whole process), though perhaps I\'ve missed some earlier discussion.\n    - A bit more clarity could also be used in this top level loop, which I\'ll leave questions on in the Questions section.\n    - Figure 2 was quite difficult to understand (though I appreciate how nice the visuals are). I left some notes in the ""minor"" section around tweaks that could help with that.\n    - Figure 1b is meant to be an overview but I also struggled to understand it, and it doesnt include a depiction of the Request Solver (which seems important â when are the lemmas solved?). These figures all make sense to me now having read the paper, but they didn\'t help as much as I would hope for understanding the idea at a glance. This isn\'t a huge negative, but it would have been nice to get more of a feel for the overall setup from these splash figures.\n\nminor suggestions:\n- In the related work on skill libraries it\'d be worth mentioning DreamCoder (Ellis et al 2021)\n- At a glance it\'s difficult to see that Fig 2 is actually two subfigures â spacing them out more and/or making a thicker/different line between the two would help readability.\n- I\'d suggest that Fig 2 should not reuse ""skill library"" in all 3 places, it should separately be lemma store, request store, and problem store. It was quite confusing that things labelled as ""retrieved skill"" and ""formal statement"" and ""request"" and ""similar skill"" (using labels in top right of each box) are all coming out of the skill library in different situations. Alternatively, something like color coding the different parts of the store and using color to show which is used in each place. This would just generally help for readers who glance at the figures before reading through the whole setup.\n- The main text having a table containing just the system messages from the prompt (can abbreviate away the ""expert mathematician"" bit) would be immensely helpful if space permits â looking to the appendix for those was key for my understanding. This would immediately clear up a lot of things, such as how the decomposer is producing two different outputs.\n- Section 3.3 has a ""Table ??"" where the reference must have broken; likewise there is a ""Figure ??"" and a ""Fig. ?? (a)"" near the end of 4.2\n- at the bottom of page 5, the phrase ""As depicted in Fig. 7"" should be moved a few sentences ahead â Fig 7 has the prompt, which is only relevant to the latter sentence ""Finally, the request solver prompts the LLM to generate the proof for the request.""\n- Missing period at end of first paragraph of section 2'}, 'questions': {'value': '- Table 1: is it correct that the `LEGO-Prover*` entry effectively has more than 100 attempts since its merging all solutions from 100 human proof attempts and 100 model proof attempts?\n- Table 1: where is the entry for LEGO-Prover (model proof) miniF2F-test?\n- What exactly happens in the ablation: does it call the informal solver, then the decomposer (but without creating helper lemmas, just getting a step-by-step proof), then the formalizer directly (without retrieving helper lemmas)? And is the autocorrect sledgehammer approach used in the ablation as well? Does it get human or model informal proofs?\n    - I could imagine two reasonable ablations, one that includes first generating a step-by-step proof and one that just directly produces the final proof. Both would be quite informative, though I think only the step-by-step one would be essential.\n- Is it right that on each of the 100 passes, LEGO-Prover runs the Decomposer once then the Formalizer once on each problem?\n- I know that for every 3 Problem Store problems attempted it makes 8 Request Store attempts (or ""Evolver"" attempts). Based on the Evolver section that could either mean using Directional Transformer or the Request Solver or both â is one or the other picked in some ratio, or are both used?\n- Presumably sometimes the skills aren\'t used at all and just happen to be retrieved mistakenly as relevant by the vector store. Are these cases counted as ""used to formulate new lemmas"" in your analysis, since it\'s hard to disentangle them without some sort of similarity analysis?\n- ""Moreover, the learned skill library contains 22532 skills encompassing many useful high-level lemmas broadly applicable to various problems, as is shown in our case study and ablation study."" To prove the point of the library having many broadly applicable lemmas, and to better understand the usefulness of the lemmas in general, it\'d be helpful to see an analysis of lemma usage frequency in *correct solutions* to problems â for example how often is the most frequently-used lemma used?\n    - A more detailed analysis, not necessary for this submission in my opinion but which certainly would strengthen it: have a histogram with number of uses on the x-axis so you can see this distribution of usage frequency for all of the lemmas. \n\nvery minor:\n- Fig 3c: I think some labels might be mixed up: The skill resulting form parameterize() doesn\'t look like it fits the prompt for ""parameterize"" which is ""If the problem involves specific numbers, generalize it by replacing these with variables.""

However, extending diffusion models to tabular data is challenging due to the intricately varied distributions and a blend of data types of tabular data. This paper introduces TabSyn, a methodology that synthesizes tabular data by leveraging a diffusion model within a variational autoencoder (VAE) crafted latent space. The key advantages of the proposed Tabsyn include (1) Generality: the ability to handle a broad spectrum of data types by converting them into a single unified space and explicitly capturing inter-column relations; (2) Quality: optimizing the distribution of latent embeddings to enhance the subsequent training of diffusion models, which helps generate high-quality synthetic data; (3) Speed: much fewer number of reverse steps and faster synthesis speed than existing diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on six datasets with five metrics demonstrate that Tabsyn outperforms existing methods. Specifically, it reduces the error rates by 86% and 67% for column-wise distribution and pair-wise column correlation estimations compared with the most competitive baselines.

The primary goal is to generate synthetic data that faithfully reproduces the distribution of the original dataset. The variational autoencoder (VAE) in TabSyn learns latent representations of each row of tabular data, but is not optimized for any specific downstream task.\n\nMost importantly, since we currently focus on unconditional training, label information (such as class labels in classification tasks and target values in regression tasks) is trained and generated alongside other columns' features. Therefore, the latent encoding obtained by the VAE model already contains label information. In this case, if we directly use latent encoding to predict downstream tasks, there is actually a risk of label leakage. We conducted experiments in this regard and found that accuracy, AUC score, and other metrics were all close to 100%.\n\n\n> Q2: Are all classification tasks in downstream binary tasks? (AUC)\n\nYes, the four classification datasets - Adult, Default, Shoppers and Magic - are all for binary classification. As a result, we use the AUC score as the metric in Machine Learning Efficiency tasks. \n\nOur proposed method can also directly train on multi-class classification datasets without requiring modifications during training since it is an unconditional generation approach.

Every question raised by you has been thoughtfully examined.\n\n> W1: The difference between Latent Score-based Generative\nModel (LSGM) and our proposed TabSyn, and the technical novelty\n\n\nWe acknowledge your observation regarding the similarity between Tabsyn and LSGM (Vahdat 2021). However, it is important to highlight key distinctions. \n \n1. A key difference between tabular data and image data lies in the variety of data types present in tabular data, encompassing both numerical and categorical features. In contrast, image data primarily comprises continuous pixel values that denote color and intensity. Tabsyn is specifically designed for mixed-type tabular data, a domain with unique challenges not addressed by LSGM. The feature tokenization process in Tabsyn represents a notable advancement tailored for such data, ensuring effective handling of diverse data types (numeric, categorical, etc.). \n2. Additionally, a fundamental aspect of tabular data is its complex relationships between columns, which differs from the localized spatial correlation observed in images, where pixel values largely correlate with adjacent pixels. Tabsyn uses a lightweight transformer model as the encoder and decoder in the VAE to capture intricate columns relationships. The self-attention mechanism in the Transformer enables each column to dynamically interact and integrate information from all other columns. This is accomplished by learning the importance weights of every other columns when processing a particular column.\n3. Training a VAE on tabular data presents a distinct challenge compared to training on image data. With image data, small errors in pixel values often do not significantly impact object recognition. However, with tabular data, precision in the values of each column is relatively more important for preserving the semantics of the data. As a result, a higher weight on the reconstruction loss is beneficial when training a VAE on tabular data in order to minimize distortion of the input. However, an excessively high reconstruction loss weight can lead to a poor approximation of the posterior distribution, $q(z)$. To address this issue, we introduce an adaptive schedule for the weight parameter, $\\beta$, which allows more effective training of the VAE model on tabular data. The rationale and efficacy of this adaptive weight schedule are demonstrated through the results presented in Figure 3 and Table 4 in the paper.\n4. Although the diffusion process is conceptually similar to LSGM, we make further improvements to the sampling speed. Specifically, we introduce a noise level proportional to the time step. Through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, we demonstrate this improvement significantly reduces the number of steps needed to generate synthetic data compared to LSGM.\n\nOverall, Tabsyn's technical innovations lie in its specialized approach to handling the mixed-type and complexity of tabular data, from (1) its feature tokenization process and (2) its sophisticated use of a transformer model to capture column relationships to (3) its adaptive training schedule for VAE and (4) enhanced diffusion process for efficient data generation. These technical advancements are critical in enhancing the model's performance and are not present in LSGM.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer dVGm (2/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""> Q2 & W2: Incorporate more datasets.\n\nWe selected datasets for our research based on two key criteria: data type diversity and accessibility. Since our study focuses on synthesizing tabular data containing both numerical and categorical features, we needed datasets with mixed data types. Also we preferred openly available datasets that could be easily downloaded for reproducibility.  After reviewing options, we chose six representative tabular datasets with mixed data types from UCI Machine Learning Repository to use in our experiments. The datasets contain a combination of numerical and categorical features relevant to our research goals. To facilitate future work, we provide code in our open-source codebase to download these datasets.\n\nWe recognize that many datasets in Table 2 of TabDDPM (Kotelnikov et al. 2022) only include numerical features, which do not match the mixed data types needed for this research. To expand the availability of suitable datasets, we plan to acquire and integrate additional datasets from Table 2 that do contain both numerical and categorical features. We welcome contributions from the research community to further expand the selection of datasets compatible with our codebase and support new lines of research.\n\n\n> Q3 & W3: Add SMOTE as a baseline in the results.\n\nThank you for the reviewer's suggestion; indeed, SMOTE can also be utilized for synthesizing new data in tabular data scenarios. Our initial idea was to investigate the synthesis of new data using deep generative models from random noise. While SMOTE can also generate new data, being an interpolation-based method, it may lack a certain level of randomness. Furthermore, SMOTE may encounter certain challenges when it comes to interpolating categorical features. Therefore, we did not consider it as a baseline in our study. \n\nSince the reviewer suggested it, we conducted experiments using SMOTE on the six datasets studied in this paper. We transformed categorical features into one-hot encoding for interpolation purposes. The table below shows the performance of SMOTE on various tasks across different datasets (Furthermore, in the previous response, we also provided its performance in terms of privacy protection and detection):\n\n| Metric | Adult | Default | Shoppers | Magic  | Beijing | News |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Single Column | 1.6\\% | 1.48\\% | 2.68\\% | 0.91\\% | 1.85\\% | 5.31\\% |\n| Pair Correlation | 3.28\\% | 8.41\\% | 3.56\\% | 3.16\\% | 2.39\\% | 5.38\\% |\n| MLE | 0.899 | 0.741 | 0.911 | 0.934 | 0.593 | 0.897 |\n\nWe note that by interpolating on individual dimensions, SMOTE exhibits excellent performance in the single-column density estimation metric. However, in the column pair correlation estimation metric, SMOTE's performance becomes suboptimal. This could be attributed to the possibility of non-linear correlations between different columns, making it challenging to reconstruct them through interpolation. On the Machine Learning Efficiency task as well, the data generated by SMOTE has achieved commendable performance. However, as discussed in Q1 & W4, the DCR score of the data generated by SMOTE is notably low, indicating a significant probability of direct copying from the training set. \n\nTherefore, we believe that SMOTE can serve as a data augmentation method but may not be suitable as a standalone generative model. In the latest version of the code, we have added support for SMOTE as a new baseline. Please check the updated code if you are interested. We will also include the results above in the corresponding tables in the revised table.\n\n> Q4: Confidence Intervals.\n\nThe confidence score is computed through cross-validation. To be detailed, we randomly split the dataset 20 times, and within each split we train the model and sample the synthetic dataset.\n\n\n> Q5: Publishment of the codes.\n\nSure, we will publish the entire codebase.\n\n\n> Q6: Try the codes on 2d synthetic sklearn examples.\n\nOur method can also be applied to 2d synthetic data from sklearn. In the updated codes, we have added a 2d synthetic dataset 'blob' of three classes created using sklearn.makeblobs. It is reformulated as a tabular dataset of 3 columns, where the first two columns are the 2d numerical features, and the last column is the categorical feature, denoting the label of each example. We also created a notebook blob.ipynb for facilitating running experiments on the synthetic dataset.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer dVGm (1/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""We appreciate the insightful feedback from the reviewer, which improves our evaluation setup.\n\n> Q1 & W4 Provide privacy metrics (e.g., DCR) and detection metrics (e.g., C2ST) in the benchmark.\n\nBased on the suggestion, we have included the DCR score as a metric for assessing privacy protection, as well as C2ST as a metric for detection. Below are the implementation details of these two metrics and our preliminary results.\n\n**For the DCR score**, it appears that the âsdmetricsâ library does not provide a corresponding implementation. Therefore, we developed this metric from scratch. Specifically, we followed the 'synthetic vs. holdout' setting as described in 'https://www.clearbox.ai/blog/2022-06-07-synthetic-data-for-privacy-preservation-part-2.' We initially divided the dataset into two equal parts: the first part served as the training set for training our generative model, while the second part was designated as the holdout set, which was not used for training. After the completion of model training, we sampled a synthetic set of the same size as the training set (and the holdout set). \n\nWe then calculated the DCR scores for each sample in the synthetic set with respect to both the training set and the holdout set. We can create histograms to visualize the distribution of DCR scores for the synthetic set in comparison to both the training and holdout sets. Intuitively, if there is a privacy issue (e.g., if the synthetic set is directly copied from the training set), then the DCR scores for the training set should be closer to 0 than those for the testing set. Conversely, if there is no privacy issue, the distribution of DCR scores for the training and holdout sets should largely overlap.  We plot these figures and have updated them in Figure 10, Appendix F.5 in the revised paper.\n\nAdditionally, we can calculate the probability that a synthetic sample is closer to the training set (rather than the holdout set). If this probability is close to 50% (i.e., 0.5), it indicates that the distribution of distances between synthetic and training instances is very similar (or at least not systematically smaller) than the distribution of distances between synthetic and holdout instances. This finding is a positive indicator in terms of privacy risk. The table below displays the results obtained by different models, **including SMOTE**, on this metric, on Default and Shoppers datasets:\n\n\n| Method        | Default            | Shoppers    |\n| --------      | -------            | -------     | \n| SMOTE         |  91.41%Â±3.42       | 96.40%Â±4.70 |\n| STaSy         |  50.23%Â±0.09       | 51.53%Â±0.16 |\n| Codi          |  51.82%Â±0.26       | 51.06%Â±0.18 |\n| TabDDPM       |  52.15%Â±0.20       | 63.23%Â±0.25 |\n| TabSyn (ours) |  51.20%Â±0.18       | 52.90%Â±0.22 |\n\n\n**For the C2ST score**, we employed the detection metric provided by sdmetrics: https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics/metrics/metrics-in-beta/detection-single-table.

The detection score shows significant variations across different models for synthetic data generation. The proposed TabSyn consistently achieves notably high scores across all datasets. SMOTE directly interpolates within the training set, so it is not surprising that it achieves high scores in the detection metric.\n\nWe've updated these results in the revised paper in Appendix F.5 and AppendiX F.6.

When we tried to reproduce TabDDPM's results, we noticed it performs very well on most datasets but does poorly on the News dataset. This is not due to training issues, since the training curve looks normal. Instead, the generated content converges to repetitive values rather than a diverse distribution. This explains the failure to generate meaningful News content. To illustrate, we show the samples from the News training set and the corresponding TabDDPM syntheses. The training data exhibits variety, while the model's output is stuck in a narrow mode.\n\nTraining Set (News dataset)\n|   timedelta | n_tokens_title | n_tokens_content | n_unique_tokens |n_non_stop_words  | ... |\n| --------   | ------- | ------- |  ------- | ------- | ------- | \n|  423.0 | 7.0 | 259.0 |0.6762295 |1.0 |\n|  147.0 | 10.0 | 577.0 | 0.5044092 | 1.0|\n|  665.0 | 8.0 | 252.0 | 0.6468254 | 1.0 |\n|  593.0 | 10.0 | 167.0 | 0.7468354 | 1.0 |\n|  ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n\nTabDDPM Synthesized Data (News dataset)\n|   timedelta | n_tokens_title | n_tokens_content | n_unique_tokens |n_non_stop_words  | ... |\n| --------   | ------- | ------- |  ------- | ------- | ------- | \n|  731.0 | 23.0 | 0.0 | 701.0 | 1042.0 |\n|  731.0 | 23.0 | 0.0 | 701.0 | 1042.0 |\n|  731.0 | 23.0 | 0.0 | 701.0 | 1042.0 |\n|  731.0 | 23.0 | 0.0 | 701.0 | 1042.0 |\n|  ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n\nTo investigate further, we attempted to remove the two columns of categorical features from News, leaving only numerical features. With this simplified dataset, TabDDPM now synthesizes high-quality diverse examples. It achieved low error rates of 0.81% on Single Column Density Estimation and 1.09% on Column Pair Correlation Estimation. This suggests the categorical columns in News caused issues for TabDDPM in properly learning the true data distribution.\n\nWe further investigate the changes in training loss under both scenarios and found that in the absence of categorical columns, the Gaussian noise loss (corresponding to numerical features) can converge to a relatively low value, around 0.25. However, when both categorical columns are present, the Gaussian noise loss can only decrease to around 0.6. This suggests that the multinomial losses from the categorical columns may be hindering the training of the numerical columns. It indicates that the current training method adopted by TabDDPM may have some limitations, although this could be considered a corner case.\n\n> W6: Deploy MLE as a privacy protection metric.\n\nThe initial version of the paper used Machine Learning Efficiency (MLE) as a Privacy Protection application because we thought training models on synthetic data instead of original data protected privacy. After listening to this suggestion, we realized that categorizing MLE as a privacy protection task was inappropriate. Therefore, in the updated paper, we have revised this statement. \n\nAdditionally, we adopted the suggestion from reviewer dVGm, using the Distance to Closest Records (DCRs) scores to evaluate privacy protection. The corresponding results have been updated in Appendix F.5, Figure 10, and Table 12. The corresponding code updates have also been incorporated into our codebase.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer Fs1y (2/3)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""> W2: Synthetic data generated directly from TabSyn's VAE\n\nWe studied the data synthesis capability of TabSyn's VAE under different $\\beta$ settings just as done in Table 4. The results on Adult dataset concerning density estimation errors are presented in the following table.\n\n|  $\\beta$           |  Single            | Pair         |\n| --------           | -------            | -------      | \n| VAE: $\\beta=1.0$(Vanilla VAE) | 12.67\\% $\\pm$ 1.44 | 23.37\\% $\\pm$ 2.15 |\n| VAE: $\\beta=0.1$              | 24.01\\% $\\pm$ 1.6 | 37.61\\% $\\pm$ 1.99 |\n| VAE: $\\beta=0.01$             | 31.99\\% $\\pm$ 1.5 | 45.22\\% $\\pm$ 3.31 |\n| VAE: Scheduled $\\beta$  | 36.25\\% $\\pm$ 2.26 | 50.18\\% $\\pm$ 3.19 |\n| TabSyn  | **0.58\\%** $\\pm$ 0.06 | **1.54\\%** $\\pm$ 0.27 |\n\nAs demonstrated in the table, directly using TabSyn's VAE model to obtain synthetic data leads to poor data quality, regardless of the $\\beta$.  Indeed, a small $\\beta$ can lead to effective reconstruction of the original table, but at the cost of $q(z)$ deviating significantly from the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$. On the other hand, a larger beta can make $q(z)$ approach $N(0, I)$, but it may result in poorer reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we found that, for the VAE, maintaining $q(z)$ close to $\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$ is advantageous for generating higher-quality synthetic data.\n\n> W3: Performance under different parameter scales\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that comparing the performance of different methods of different scales of parameters will provide a broder comparison of each method. To this end, we adjust the hidden dimension of TabSyn's denoising MLP (the architecture of which is in Appendix D.2, Figure 8) within [128, 256, 512, 1024] (1024 is the default value). We adjust those for baseline methods CTGAN, CoDi and TabDDPM correspondingly. The following table presents the performance comparison concerning single column and pair correlation on Adult (singl-column error / pair correlation error):\n\n|   Hidden dim  | 128  | 256   | 512  | 1024   |\n| --------   | ------- | ------- |  ------- | ------- | \n|  CTGAN  | 23.14 / 28.92 | 20.64 / 25.26 |  17.92 / 22.89 | 16.84 / 20.23 |\n|  CoDi   | 29.16 / 29.65 | 26.42 / 27.58 | 22.91 / 24.06 | 21.38 / 22.49 |\n|  TabDDPM   | 8.69 / 12.39 | 5.36 / 8.75 | 2.32 / 4.19 | 1.75 / 3.01 |\n|  TabSyn | **4.02** / **8.51** | **1.92** / **4.22** | **0.65** / **2.06** | **0.58** / **1.54** |\n\nA clear observation is that when reducing the model's parameter count, all models exhibit a similar degree of performance decline. This is easily understood because when the model's capacity is not large enough, it becomes challenging to accurately learn the distribution of complex data.

On the other hand, our VAE requires the scheduling of the trade-off hyperparameter beta during training, which involves a certain number of steps. Depending on the training stage, we gradually adjust the importance weighting between Reconstruction loss and KL loss (see Figure 3 in the submitted paper).\n\n**Criteria used to determine the termination of training.**\n\nIn all of the experiments, we trained the VAE for a fixed 4000 epochs. This decision was based on our observation that after training for 4000 epochs, the VAE's validation reconstruction loss had already approached convergence to a low value. This indicates that the learned VAE is capable of effectively reconstructing the input data. We did not employ any additional techniques to prematurely terminate the training of the VAE.\n\n**Introducing early stopping might be beneficial.**\nWe have implemented early stopping in the updated codebase to terminate VAE training prematurely based on the suggestion to use this technique.\n\n**Train/Val accuracy of 100% seems achievable by the 1000th epoch.**\n\nThe output training/validation accuracy solely reflects the reconstruction correctness of categorical features, and therefore, it cannot represent the overall reconstruction results since numerical features also require reconstruction. Moreover, consider a binary categorical variable where the ground truth is class 0. Predicted class distributions of [0.55, 0.45] and [0.99, 0.01] would both be considered correct predictions, but it's evident that we prefer predictions with higher confidence. Hence, Cross-Entropy loss is a more effective measure than accuracy in reflecting the quality of reconstruction, as it takes into account the confidence in predictions.\n\n> W1: Performance of sub-optimally trained VAEs.\n\nWe investigated the quality of synthetic data generated by TabSyn using the embeddings of the VAE obtained at different epochs as the latent space.

We can observe that \n1. Increasing the training epochs of the VAE improves the quality of TabSyn's generated data.\n2. even when the VAE is sub-optimal (e.g., training epochs around 2000), TabSyn's performance is close to the optimal ones. \n3. even with a relatively low number of VAE training epochs (e.g., 800-1200), TabSyn's performance approaches or even surpasses the most competitive baseline, TabDDPM.\n \nBased on these observations, we recommend thoroughly training the VAE to achieve superior data generation quality when resources are abundant. However, when resources are limited, reducing the VAE training duration still yields decent performance.\n\nBesides, in Figure 6 of the initial paper submission, we investigated the sensitivity of hyperparameters in the VAE on TabSyn's performance.

Below, we address your concerns, hoping our revisions clarify all the questions and strengthen the quality of our work. \n\n> W1: The motivation behind using latent diffusion for tabular data generation.\n\nWe have illustrated the motivation behind using latent diffusion for tabular data in the first paragraph of the Introduction section. To provide a clearer and more concise explanation, we can rephrase it as follows: \n\nOne significant distinction between tabular data and image data is the presence of mixed data types in tabular data, including both numerical and categorical features, whereas image data primarily consists of continuous pixel values representing color and intensity.  Standard diffusion processes rely on a continuous input space with Gaussian noise perturbation, making them unsuitable for handling categorical features. Prior work employed different distribution functions for different data types (e.g., Gaussian noise for numerical variables and categorical noise for categorical variables). This approach poses difficulties in the model's ability to effectively capture the co-occurrence patterns among different types of data. To address this limitation and preserve inter-column correlations for tabular data, our approach involves developing a diffusion model in a joint space that accommodates both numerical and categorical features. This choice to use latent diffusion for tabular data generation is driven by the need to bridge this gap. \n\nIn the following answer, we illustrate how we achieve this by transforming mixed-type tabular data into a unified space using a well-designed VAE for tabular data.\n\n> W1-2: Model design for tabular data characteristics and handling mixed-type data.\n\nTabular data have three main characteristics: (1) the mixed type heterogeneous data, including numerical variables and categorical variables, (2) the correlation among columns, and (3) the complex and varied distribution and statistical properties for each column.\n\n- To handle mixed-type data, we have developed specialized feature tokenizers that transform each column into a space with the same *d* dimensions. For numerical columns, we utilize learnable linear transformations, while for categorical columns, we employ learnable embedding lookup tables. Then, these processed features were further fused through a Transformer encoder.\n- To capture correlation among columns, we employ a VAE-based on the Transformer architecture. The self-attention mechanism in Transformer allows each column to dynamically interact and fuse with all others. This is achieved by learning the importance weights of every other column when processing a particular column. \n- To learn the complex tabular data distributions, we combine the VAE and the diffusion process. By training a VAE on tabular data, each column's statistics are compressed into latent variables that capture the essential statistical properties of that column. The VAE is trained using a reconstruction loss function with a KL divergence term. This regularization encourages the latent space to approximate a standard normal distribution, which supports capturing the varied distributions of different columns. After training the VAE, a diffusion process is applied to the latent representations. By needing to denoise the added noises during the diffusion process, the model learns the underlying structure of the data distribution. Together, VAEs and diffusions allow for capturing complex and varied column distributions.""}}, {'summary': {'value': 'This work introduces a latent diffusion model for generating tabular data, and presents a benchmark consisting of six datasets and five quality metrics to evaluate the performance.

This wasn't an issue with the full sample size of 32561.

Based on my prior experiences with the TVAE model using CTGAN's code, training for around 300 epochs usually suffices. Is the transformer architecture inherently more demanding in terms of training duration? Additionally, what criteria do you rely on to determine the termination of training? Introducing an early stopping mechanism might be beneficial, especially considering the subsequent training phase for the diffusion model.

A common approach is to filter out samples that make less contribution to the training. This could lead to gradient expectation bias compared to the original data. To solve this problem, we propose InfoBatch, a novel framework aiming to achieve lossless training acceleration by unbiased dynamic data pruning. Specifically, InfoBatchrandomly prunes a portion of less informative samples based on the loss distribution and rescales the gradients of the remaining samples to approximate the original gradient. As a plug-and-play and architecture-agnostic framework, InfoBatch consistently obtains lossless training results on classification, semantic segmentation, vision pertaining, and instruction fine-tuning tasks. On CIFAR10/100, ImageNet-1K, and ADE20K, InfoBatch losslessly saves 40% overall cost. For pertaining MAE and diffusion model, InfoBatch can respectively save 24.8% and 27% cost. For LLaMA instruction fine-tuning, combining InfoBatch and the recent coreset selection method (DQ) can achieve 10 times acceleration. Our results encourage more exploration on the data efficiency aspect of large model training.

[Improvement compared to UCB]**\n\nQuestion: Overhead cost saving seems negligible compared to the wall clock time and the total node hour.\n\nResponse:\nThe major improvement is in the lossless saving ratio, as on CIFAR-100 ResNet-50, InfoBatch saved 41% compared to 20% of UCB.\nThe saved time is a 100% improvement (800s->1640s). We agree in Table 2 the overhead saving (0.03h to 0.0028h) is not\na significant improvement compared to training time saving (17.5h->10h). We degraded the corresponding claim of the part about time complexity in the updated revision.\n\n**2. [Details explanation]**\n\nQuestion:\n(a) How was the overall saved cost calculated in Tables 6 and 7?\n(b) Is annealing taken into account for saving?\n(c) How many random seeds used\n\nResponse:\n(a) As the overhead is negligible compared to training, the overall saved cost is both wall clock time and sample iteration.\n(b) Our time = overhead + pruned training time + annealing training time. For table 1, InfoBatch saves slightly more\ncost than reported, with annealing already taken into account (not contributing to saving).\n(c) For CIFAR-10/100 experiments, we measured at least 3 trials for those values with std.\n\n**3. [Full data at warmup]**\n\nQuestion:\nUsing full dataset at warmup.\n\nResponse:\nIn the experiment of Timm Swin-Tiny training, we warm up with the full dataset for 5 epochs to avoid training instability.\nOn other tasks, the mean has an adaptive pruning ratio which probably serves as a pruning warmup (revised Appendix E.1 Fig 6).\nViT-based networks seem more sensitive to this warmup stage than CNN-based ones.\n\n**4. [Annelaing's effect]**\n\n\nQuestion:\nMay need to provide further clarification regarding how annealing contributes to the stabilization of the rescaling process.\n\nResponse:\nWe draw a plot in the revised E.2 Fig.8. All experiments use the same saving ratio. In this plot, compared to only rescaling,\nadding annealing leads to an increased mean performance and slightly reduced performance variance.\n\n**5. [Clarification of necessity and effectiveness of using loss values as a pruning criterion]**\n\nQuestion:\nFurther clarify the necessity and effectiveness of using loss values as a pruning criterion.\n\nResponse: \n**By reasonably utilizing loss, we can further improve data efficiency,\nbased on the inference in Appendix B.3 (revised version B.4)**. In table 5 (CIFAR-100 R-50), the lossless pruning ratio using the mean is 33%. \nIn section 3.1 experiment details we claim to **use a more aggressive pruning probability** r(0.75)\n**for smaller loss samples** (lowest 20%) on CIFAR-100; that leads to a 41.3% saving ratio in Table 6. We demonstrate the additional experiment showing **Pruning high-loss samples with an aggressive ratio would harm the performance significantly**.\n**Loss is preferred over random, especially when using an adaptive high pruning ratio; The overhead of loss is negligible, thus its improvement is of almost no cost.**\n\n\nSince the discussion period is about to close soon, could we know if our responses addressed your concerns?

To improve data efficiency, we use the percentile method to prune part of the data (20%) with a more aggressive ratio r (0.75)\nas the default setting on several datasets, as claimed in section 3.1.\n\nBy doing so, a higher pruning ratio can be achieved without performance loss. In Table 6 with this improvement,\nCIFAR-100 ResNet-50 can achieve 41.3% saving ratio, compared to 33% in Table 5 with uniform r.\n\nA theoretical related analysis is in Appendix B.3 (updated revision B.4), suggesting that $\\mathbb{E}\\_\\text{rescaled}[G\\_{z}^2/(1-\\mathcal{P}\\_t(z))]\\leq {\\mathbb{E}}\\_{\\mathcal{D}}[G_z^2]$\ncould be a condition for healthy rescaling.

We shortened the 2.3 and rearranged the layout to enlarge the figures (in the updated revision). The corresponding change \nis as follows:\n* Sec 1, we enlarge Fig 1 and move it to the top of the page.\n* Sec 2.3, we shorten the Theoretical analysis and move part of the proof to B.1.\n* Sec 3, we put the previous Fig 3 and Fig 4 together to the top, making them no longer surrounded by text.\n* Sec 3.5, we increase the size of Table 8 and Table 9.\n\n\n**Q5: Overhead acceleration not significant compared to current dynamic pruning with sort**\n\n**A5:** Thanks for the question. Sort is O(NlogN) for full data and amortized O(logN) for each sample, ours is O(N) and \namortized O(1). We design the operation considering it could differ in a large factor when N is very big, as shown in Appendix D table 11.\n\nThe overhead saving of operation compared to UCB is 10 times (0.03h to 0.0028h) on ImageNet-1K; however we agree it is \nnot a significant improvement compared to training time saving (17.5h->10h). Our main saving comes from saving the forward and backward\ncomputation, which is shown in the table below:\n\n**Setting:** ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100. All results are averaged across three runs with std reported.\nWe report their acc and pruning ratio here. \n\n|           | Overhead (s) | Saving      | Acc.

The saved time is a 100% (800s->1600s) improvement.\n* At the same saving ratio, UCB has a much higher performance degradation\n\nWe degraded the claim of the part on time complexity, which can be visible in the new revision. The main modifications can \nbe summarized as:\n1. in section 4 related works, we change ""which could be a non-negligible overhead"" -> ""which could be an overhead""'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to DemB (1/3)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We sincerely thank the reviewer DemB for the careful review and valuable comments/questions.\nFor the concerns and questions, we make responses as follows.\n\n**Q1: Idea similar to other dynamic pruning approaches, not providing a different point of view in the matter.**\n\n**A1:** Thanks for the comment. In section 1 paragraph 5, we stated: \n* ""Directly pruning data may lead to a biased gradient\nestimation as illustrated in Fig. 1a, which affects the convergence result. This is a crucial factor that\nlimits their performance, especially under a high pruning ratio (corresponding results in Tab. 1)""\n\nTo better illustrate the difference, we show a table here for comprehensive analysis:\n\n| method                       | soft prune | rescale | anneal | unbiased| Task                                         | lossless saving ratio |\n|------------------------------|------------|---------|--------|---------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Other Dynamic Pruning [1][2] | no         | no      | no     | no      | Classification                               | ~20%                   |\n| InfoBatch                    | yes        | yes     | yes    | yes     | Classification, Segmentation, Diffusion, LLM | 40%                    |\n\n\n**Analysis:** \n* Previous methods don\'t use soft pruning. It could lead to a biased gradient direction (see Appendix B.1, or B.2 in the updated revision).\n* Previous methods don\'t use rescaling. This leads to a lack in total update, which is more severe at a higher pruning ratio.\n* Previous methods don\'t use annealing. Therefore a remaining bias could be left (Appendix B.2 or updated revision B.3 further discussed annealing).\n* Previous methods mainly focus on classification. InfoBatch can be applied to a broader range of tasks.\n\n\n**Conclusion:** \nInfoBatch proposes a **probabilistic framework** aiming to achieve unbiased dynamic pruning (with soft pruning, rescaling, and annealing), which differs from\nother dynamic pruning works that propose **metrics** and use **sort** to select more important samples.\n\n\n**Q2: Ablation of threshold selection.**\n\n**A2:** Thanks for the comment.

It is true InfoBatch cannot\nguarantee a lossless result in all settings, but the empirical hyperparameters have already achieve lossless results on image classification,\nsemantic segmentation, image generation, and language model finetuning.\n\nWe are welcome to further discussion on this problem during the author reviewer discussion period.\n\n\n**Q7: What fraction of the data are soft-pruned throughout training?**\n\n**A7:** Thanks for the question.

We design the operation considering it could differ by a large factor when N is very big.\n\nThis overhead saving of operation compared to UCB is 10 times (0.03h to 0.0028h) on ImageNet-1K; however we agree it is \nnot a significant improvement compared to training time saving (17.5h->10h).

I suspect (intuitively and based on the ablations in Table 4 plus the pruning rule seemingly being irrelevant in Table 5) that ensuring the total length of the optimization trajectory remains comparable to that on the full dataset (by rescaling the gradients) in conjunction with the fine-tuning on all data towards the end of training is the ""secret sauce"" to making a dynamic pruning method perform without a degradation in test accuracy. I\'m not familiar with the (Raju et al., 2021) paper, but would expect that at least the annealing period could be incorporated into this method without further issue. At the moment the paper presents its selection rule leading to performance matching that of full-data training as a core contribution, however if this can be achieved relatively easily with other selection techniques as well, I think it becomes more about the re-scaling/tuning as general purpose techniques and the cost comparison between different selection approaches being featured more prominently. I don\'t think this would worsen the paper at all, although it would change the key takeaways a fair bit and I think it is important that the latter accurately reflect the empirical results.\n* On a related note, I am a little bit concerned that the hyperparameters on e.g. ResNets for CIFAR10 are not tuned for achieving the final test performance as quickly as possible. I think it would be worth adding a baseline that trains on all data with a reduced number of epochs/learning rate decay milestones but increased learning rate corresponding to the computation saved by pruning (so hypothetically for 20% saved computation, train for 80 instead of 100 epochs but with learning rate 1.25 instead of 1 and halve it after 40 instead of 80 epochs). This is to ensure that pruning approaches meaningfully speed up training rather than benefitting from slack in the canonical hyperparameter choices for benchmark problems.   \n* I don\'t entirely follow what the theoretical analysis is trying to achieve in 2.3. Isn\'t this just showing that the soft-pruned and rescaled gradient is unbiased? Isn\'t this completely obvious from having independent Bernoullis multiplied onto the terms of a sum (the total gradient over the dataset) and the expectation of a Bernoulli being its probability (so that if we divide by the probability, we get an expectation of 1 and the sum remains unchanged)?\n* I found the paper to be fairly different to what the title made me expect. ""Info"" and ""lossless"" imply a connection with information theory and lossless compression to me, which is of course not present in the method. I appreciate that this is entirely subjective, but would suggest reconsidering the title of the paper. In particular, I would argue that the ""lossless"" part is a bit misleading since this is not theoretically guaranteed by the method, but merely and empirical observation in the experiments. Of course matching performance to the full dataset can always be achieved by letting $r \\rightarrow 0, \\delta \\rightarrow 1$, but this would remove any cost savings.\n* Similarly, I think the paper overstates its relationship with coreset/data selection methods a little bit. These are generally not for speeding up an initial training run, but subsequent ones e.g. for continual learning or hyperparameter tuning and typically incur an upfront cost. On the contrary, the proposed method speeds up a given training run without producing any artefacts (a coreset) that are useful downstream.

As much as possible for Table 1 and ideally Table 2 (ResNet-18 instead of 50 is perfectly fine if that makes it more realistic). My hypothesis here would be that all baselines will match InfoBatch in discriminative performance, which would necessitate the main claims in the paper being updated (again, I don\'t think this affects the value of the contribution). If all the baselines are already using annealing and rescaling, this point is of course void.\n* Add a full data baseline with reduced epochs as proposed in the weaknesses.\n* Is there anything more to section 2.3 than showing unbiasedness?\n* I would be curious what fraction of the data are soft-pruned throughout training? With the losses being bound below by 0, I would expect the distribution to become quite asymmetric as training proceeds. Could e.g. the median or some percentile be preferable? The median (not sure about arbitrary percentiles) can be computed in linear time, although I don\'t know if it is possible to update it online as for the mean.\n* Do you have any thoughts on how to set $r$ and $\\delta$ on a new dataset/architecture? The benchmarks in the paper are of course well-studied, but I think it would be a nice addition to the paper to discuss some heuristics for finding close-to-optimal values without needing a full training run (although suboptimal values already present a cost saving of course).\n\nTypos:\n- p1, Â§3: ""constrainT computation resources"" -> ""constrainED computation resources""\n- p1, Â§4: ""cubersome"" -> ""cumbersome""\n- Section 3.3, Â§1: ""see appendix"" -> missing specific reference\n- B4. last Â§: ""bond"" -> ""bound""'}, 'flag_for_ethics_review': {'value': ['No ethics review needed.']}, 'rating': {'value': '8: accept, good paper'}, 'confidence': {'value': '4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain.

For LLaMA instruction fine-tuning, combining InfoBatch and the recent coreset selection method (DQ) can achieve 10 times acceleration.

Below we have responded to each point raised by the reviewer:\n\n1. The reviewer raises a good point that autoregressive LMs have very different capabilities and advantages compared to non-autoregressive models. The natural way to condition on metadata for dWJS is to add prefix tokens for metadata (e.g., species) and sample with those tokens included. It is also true that for wet-lab integration, sampling speed/computational cost is negligible compared to lab experiments. The advantages in sampling speed are more interesting for iteration and method development of new ML methods, where fine-tuning LMs may be insufficient and pre-training from scratch may be impractical. Nevertheless, we believe that pre-trained LLMs are an under-studied model type in ML for biology, hence our investigations into their baseline performance for sequence generation.\n\n2. DC Score is primarily a way to formulate a single, aggregated scalar objective based on feature engineering, to detect if a generative model is producing samples that are âin-distributionâ with respect to the training data. We find that DCS is a reliable measure to indicate if samples will express in the lab, and we used DCS as an in silico metric for developing our methods, which allowed us to achieve a high expression rate in the first round of lab experiments. However, we find that for DCS > 0.3, almost all proteins are expressed. We have added this additional context in the discussion of DCS, to more clearly motivate its usage and explain how it was used in silico before conducting wet-lab experiments. We have clarified these points in the discussion of DC score by moving some of the technical details to Appendix F to respect the page limits and adding the following text to Section 3.2: âNo multiple sequence alignment or pre-processing of the sequences is required. For convenience and because we have small numbers of examples and low dimensions, we use kernel density estimation (KDE) to compute the joint density. However, DCS is completely general and can be combined with any density estimatorâ¦\u200b\u200bEmpirically, we find that DCS is a useful in silico evaluation metric for developing generative methods and hyperparameter optimization, and that methods with DCS > 0.3 yield nearly 100% expressing proteins in the wet lab.â \n\n3. We have not explored treating the modeling problem over a probability simplex and sampling, primarily because âgreedyâ decoding with argmax worked so well for achieving high sample quality and diversity. Sampling from the probabilities is certainly an interesting future direction for increasing the control over sampling.\n\n4. The most important hyperparameter to set is the noise level, sigma. In section 3.2 we derive a âcritical noise levelâ of ~0.5 for our data, which agrees with our empirical findings that 0.5 < sigma < 1.0 leads to good sampling. To provide some intuition, sigma should be large enough to smooth the data and make sampling easier, but not so large that the denoising network cannot recover âvalidâ samples. The âdefaultâ value of sigma in [0.5, 1.0] works well. We have included additional experiments and discussion in Appendix A.5 and Table 6 to illustrate this point.\n\n5. The DC score is an effective method for detecting samples that are not in-distribution with respect to the training data. Empirically, we find that DCS > 0.3 leads to samples that nearly all express in the lab. A low DC score (e.g., 0.06 for ESM2 shown in Table 2) indicates protein samples that will not express. We have updated the manuscript to clarify this point.\n\n6. It is interesting to think about how DC score could be generalized to also account for diversity. In our current setup, we use DCS to evaluate conformity to a reference set, and compute additional edit-distance-based metrics to evaluate diversity. To evaluate diversity, it might be possible to treat a set of generated samples as the reference set and do leave-one-out evaluation of each designâs conformity to the rest of the designs.\n\n7. Our observation that dWJS easily samples many antibody germlines (Figure 1) in a single MCMC chain shows the fast mixing time of our method - this would be impossible with a traditional energy-based model, and is not a capability of autoregressive models. In future work, we intend to do a more theory-focused exploration of the mixing time of dWJS compared to traditional MCMC methods.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We appreciate the reviewer pointing out the uniqueness of our approach and the advantages over traditional energy- and score-based approaches. The reviewerâs two main concerns relate to the effect of the noise level, sigma, and the effect of outliers on the distributional conformity score, which we address below. We hope that the reviewer will consider raising their score following our response.\n\n> While the paper touts the simplification to a single hyperparameter choice (noise level, Ï) as a strength, it might also be seen as a limitation since the entire model\'s performance could be sensitive to this single parameter.\n\n1. We agree that the simplification to a single hyperparameter does indeed make the model performance sensitive to this hyperparameter - we appreciate the reviewerâs point that having multiple hyperparameters gives more control over model performance. We would also like to highlight that the decoupling of the âwalkâ and âjumpâ steps hopefully alleviates this concern; while the same model can be used for both walking and jumping, it is also possible to decouple them and train two independent models with different noise levels, different architectures, and different hyperparameters. In this way, it is possible to re-introduce complexity into dWJS if desired. It would also be a very interesting future direction to adapt our approach to use a pre-trained encoder, which would introduce many additional hyperparameters. Nevertheless, we believe that there is considerable value in having a simple, robust generative model with high sample quality, and we do not see the single hyperparameter as a fundamental limitation.\n\n\n> Set of properties includes both continuous, binary, and discrete values and estimating the distribution by a kernel density approach may not be very effective. Also DCS may be overly influenced by outliers and extreme data points in the dataset.\n\n2. The DC score is completely general and can be combined with any density estimator, so this is not a fundamental limitation of our approach. We used kernel density estimation here for convenience, and because we have few examples and low dimensions. Density models that combine continuous and discrete values that work in the low sample regime is a promising research direction. It is possible for DCS to be influenced by outliers in a dataset (and we have noted this in Appendix F), but practically speaking we do not encounter this difficulty for protein datasets because there is usually significant sequence similarity between sequences, and âoutliersâ generally represent out-of-distribution samples that are not âvalidâ protein sequences, which is exactly what we are trying to detect with the DC score. We have clarified these points in the discussion of DC score by moving some of the technical details to Appendix F to respect the page limits and adding the following text to Section 3.2: âNo multiple sequence alignment or pre-processing of the sequences is required. For convenience and because we have small numbers of examples and low dimensions, we use kernel density estimation (KDE) to compute the joint density. However, DCS is completely general and can be combined with any density estimator.â\n\n> Is the same value of Ï=0.5 used for all reported experiments? It would be nice to see what effect lowering or increasing this value will have on some of the reported metrics for a better assessment of the sensitivity of the approach to this parameter.\n\n3. The sigma value is held constant, but following the reviewerâs suggestion, we have included additional experiments in Appendix A.5 and Table 6, showing the effects of changing the noise level on sample quality. Briefly, under-smoothing by setting sigma too low produces poor quality samples, while over-smoothing by setting sigma too large decreases the diversity of the samples. These intuitive results show the dependence on sigma, while also highlighting that the tradeoff between sample quality, uniqueness, and diversity, is easily controlled with a single hyperparameter, sigma. We have partially copied Table 6 with the new experimental results here for convenience:\n\n| sigma              | W_property | Unique   | E_dist   | IntDiv   |\n|--------------------|------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| 0.1                | 0.378      | 1.0 | 120.6   | 60.0     |\n| 3.0                | 0.130      | 0.995    | 44.2     | 30.0     |\n\n> How is d obtained in this sentence?

We agree with the reviewer, testing our approach on other protein classes or other discrete data settings would be interesting.

I'm curious to hear your perspective on the value of adding structural awareness and how feasible it would be to integrate with your dWJS approach.\n\n3. Structural data is certainly a rich source of information about proteins, and can be included into the dWJS framework in a number of ways; structure is implicitly incorporated into dWJS because antibodies are aligned according to the AHo numbering scheme. This alignment defines separate âframeworkâ and âcomplementarity-determining regionsâ in the sequence, which have precise structural interpretations. We expect that multiple sequence alignment of most protein families already provides implicit structural information. Inverse folding models can be used to score sequence designs from dWJS if there is a known antibody structure of interest. Structure-awareness could also be more directly incorporated into our approach by adapting WJS for sampling from inverse folding models. These are promising directions for future research. Structure-aware approaches introduce additional engineering complexity and a source of experimental noise in the resolution of the crystal structure training data, which may actually degrade sequence sample quality. We also have orders of magnitude more sequence than structure data, and this is particularly acute for antibodies. For sequence design tasks, we find that sequence-only models are quite useful, but for antigen (protein target)-conditioned design where there are no known binding molecules, structure-awareness is a possible approach.""}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Dear Reviewers,\n\nWe thank the reviewers for their enthusiastic and supportive reviews of our paper, and the comments and questions that have led us to improve the clarity and description of technical details of our work.

The key ideas are as follows. The discrete data distribution is smoothed by adding Gaussian noise, which makes it easier to model and sample from. A discrete energy-based model (dEBM) is used to learn the distribution of noisy protein sequences and is trained via contrastive divergence. A denoising model implemented as a ByteNet is separately trained to map the noisy sequences back to the original discrete space. Sampling is performed by first using Langevin MCMC to sample noisy sequences from the dEBM. Then the denoising model is used to map these noisy samples back to valid discrete protein sequences. The walk (MCMC sampling) and jump (denoising) steps are decoupled, which provides flexibility. The authors argue this provides benefits over autoregressive models, diffusion models, and traditional EBM training. The proposed method is shown to be effective on antibody protein sequence modeling and design tasks using both in silico and in vitro experiments, \n\nOverall, I believe this is a novel contribution which demonstrates promising results on an important and challenging problem.

"['Yang He', 'Lingao Xiao', 'Joey Tianyi Zhou', 'Ivor Tsang']",ICLR,Multisize Dataset Condensation,https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19777,2024," While dataset condensation effectively enhances training efficiency, its application in on-device scenarios brings unique challenges. 1) Due to the fluctuating computational resources of these devices, there's a demand for a flexible dataset size that diverges from a predefined size. 2) The limited computational power on devices often prevents additional condensation operations. These two challenges connect to the ""subset degradation problem"" in traditional dataset condensation: a subset from a larger condensed dataset is often unrepresentative compared to directly condensing the whole dataset to that smaller size. In this paper, we propose Multisize Dataset Condensation (MDC) by **compressing $N$ condensation processes into a single condensation process to obtain datasets with multiple sizes.** Specifically, we introduce an ""adaptive subset loss"" on top of the basic condensation loss to mitigate the ""subset degradation problem"". Our MDC method offers several benefits: 1) No additional condensation process is required; 2) reduced storage requirement by reusing condensed images. Experiments validate our findings on networks including ConvNet, ResNet and DenseNet, and datasets including SVHN,  CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. For example, we achieved 5.22%-6.40% average accuracy gains on condensing CIFAR-10 to ten images per class.

We will response point by point.\n\n> 1. The synthetic samples within the subset seem to be fixed, which may not reflect âMultisize Dataset Condensationâ correctly.\n\nThe keyword (**multisize**) in our title means the condensed dataset can be treated as a multi-sized dataset.\nThat is, the dataset of $IPC=N$ can be used as dataset of $IPC={1, 2, ..., N}$ without requiring additional condensation process.\nThis is currently unattainable using traditional approach, since traditional one condenses a synthetic dataset to a **specific IPC**. For example, dataset with $IPC=N$ will perform poorly on smaller $IPC$ ones, and we take the rights to name the phenomenon ""Subset Degradation Problem"". Our method addresses the problem, turning the dataset available for multiple size of IPCs.\n\n> 2. In Fig 2c, for baseline C, how to select subsets to calculate accuracy? Is it random? Letâs assume we have a subset of 2 images. Do we select 2 images from the condensed data randomly?\n\nFor baseline C, all subsets are selected using the $N$ images. For example, if there are $10$ images in the class, we take the first image as IPC=1, and first two images as IPC=2.\n\nTo address the concern, here is the result of randomly sampled images (see below table). We do not see an obvious advantage with one method over the other.\n\n|          | 1        | 2        | 3        | 4        | 5        | 6    | 7    | 8        | 9        | 10    | avg  |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---- | ---- | -------- | -------- | ----- | ---- |\n| First N  | 27.5     | 38.5     | **45.3** | 50.9     | **53.6** | 58.0 | 61.0 | 63.6     | **65.7** | 67.50 | 53.2 |\n| Random N | **28.4** | **39.3** | 44.3     | **51.1** | 53.2     | 58.0 | 61.0 | **63.8** | 65.6     | 67.50 | 53.2 |\n\n> 3. In basic condensation training (Sec 4.1), for each initialization the network is trained for 100 epochs. Is it the inner loop E?\n\nYes. The 100 epoch is exactly the inner loop E depicted in Fig. 3.\n\nWe hope the response addresses your concerns.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you so much for bringing up the questions and concerns. We try to address them one by one.\n\n> 1. When the IPC (Inter-Process Communication) is small, there still exists a large accuracy gap between the proposed model and Baseline-A as shown in Figure 2 and Table 1.\n\nThe IPC we use stands for Image Per Class, indicating how many images are for each class.\nThe Baseline-A uses much more resources compared to the proposed method. It is the **ideal setting** if the resources being used is the same as our method.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no method could achieve Baseline-A using the given resources (i.e., one condensation process with one dataset).\n\n> 2. The impact of the calculation interval (ât) on the performance of the MDC method needs to be further analyzed to determine the optimal interval size.\n\nOptimizing the calculate interval $\\Delta t$ will further improve the performance, and we admit finding the optimal one will not be easy, especially this hyper-parameter can vary from dataset to dataset.\nWe will leave this problem for future exploration.\nNevertheless, Tab. 7 shows that the choice of $\\Delta t$ fall a wide range, and each of them brings a considerable improvement.\n\n> 3. Can you provide the computational resource consumption and algorithmic complexity compared to Baseline-A, B, C, and other SOTA methods? It can help authors better understand the effects of algorithms in devices with limited computational resources.\n\nTab. 2 (b) compares the resources for different baselines. (A simplified version is shown below.)\n\n|      | Condense | Storage         |\n| ---- | -------- | --------------- |\n| A    | N        | 1 + 2 + ... + N |\n| B    | N        | N               |\n| C    | 1        | N               |\n| Ours | 1        | N               |\n\nTake CIFAR-10 as an example, condensing using IDC takes roughly 11 hours on average for IPC1-10. Note the time used to condense to different IPCs is different, but will not be extremely different, e.g., IPC1 ~ 10 hrs, IPC10 ~ 12 hrs.\nHere are the resources needed for each baseline:\n- Baseline-A: 110 hours + 550 images (storage)\n- Baseline-B: ~100 hours + 100 images\n- Baseline-C: 11.5 hours + 100 images\n- Ours (+0.0%): 0.6 hours + 100 images\n- Ours (+6.4%): 15.1 hours + 100 images\n\nIn conclusion, our method incurs 30% more training cost to attain 6.4% increase of average accuracy. To attain the same accuracy as Baseline-C, **0.6** hrs is enough. The visualization is presented in Fig. 4 in the paper. \n\n**Comparing to other SOTA.** We did not conduct experiments on other SOTA except for IDC-based method, but the expected additional cost is 30% - 50% (capped at 100%). The reason is that the selected IPCs are usually not large, incurring small additional cost (as shown in Fig. 5).\n\n> 4. Can you provide the values of hyperparameters such as Î» and Î· in Formula 2?\n\nThe $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ are learning rates using in dataset distillation frameworks, and we did not modify this.\nWe follow the same setting used in IDC [1] (Details can be found in Appendix C.1 in [1]).\n\n[1] J.-H.

It would be helpful to provide more detailed and accessible explanations to ensure a clear understanding for readers.\n\nThank you for the feedback, we will try to adjust the figure for a clearer presentation.'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for the positive rating. The main question provided has 3 small question, and we will address each of them accordingly.\n\n> 1. Compared to baseline A, the accuracy is not higher. Please explain the reason.\n\nTake IPC10 as an example, the Baseline-A is composed of 10 separate condensation processes and 10 different datasets.\nDuring the evaluation of the Baseline-A, we evaluate each synthetic dataset separately. Therefore, there is **NO INTERFERENCE** between datasets.\nCompare to the propose method, it requires 5x more storage.\nOur method, on the other hand, does have the inference between different subsets. For instance, IPC1 should not have information of large IPCs (IPC>1) during the evaluation of IPC1. However, during the evaluation of larger IPCs, we actually expect IPC1 to contain information of larger IPCs. Therefore, there is a conflict of interests and trade-offs should be made.\n\n> 2. Is it possible to reach Baseline A's accuracies?\n\nWe believe it is possible to reach a similar average performance (a very close one), but we don't have the proof at this stage.\nOne interesting observation is that: at larger IPCs, the performance of ImageNet outperforms Baseline-A. The below table is a taken from Tab. 1 (c) in our paper.\n\n| Dataset             |      |  10    | 15    | 20    |\n|---------------------|------|--------|-------|-------|\n| ImageNet-10         | A    |  **72.80** | 75.50 | 76.60 |\n|                     | B    |  63.60 | 62.73 | 64.13 |\n|                     | C    |  73.00 | 74.47 | 75.73 |\n|                     | Ours |  71.13 | **76.00** | **79.20** |\n\nThe performance of IPC15 and IPC20 indeed outperforms the Baseline-A, and it exceeds by a noticeable margin.\nThis gives us a sign that updating the subsets (smaller IPCs) may eventually help larger IPCs.\n\n> 3. Equation 7 is not that clear. How to calculate the distance between the full dataset and subset?\n\nThe feature distance comparison is possible even if number of images are different.\nSince both real and synthetic images are fed into the network, the output feature only differs in the number of images.\nFor example, if we sample 40 real images from full datasets and forward them, the output dimension is (40, 4, 4, 512), where 40 is the number of images, 4 is the feature size, and 512 is the number of channels. Lets say if we forward 20 synthetic images, the output will have shape like (20, 4, 4, 512), where the difference is on the first dimension. \nWe then average the feature along the first dimension, we will then obtain two averaged features of shape (4, 4, 512). Therefore we can compare. A similar approach is used by Wang etal. [1].\n\n[1] K. Wang _et al._, âCAFE: Learning to Condense Dataset by Aligning Features,â in _CVPR_, 2022.""}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the positive feedback.\nWe will address the listed questions one by one.\n\n> 1. It\'s not clear what\'s the purpose of baseline B. It looks like the results are only compared to baseline A and C.\n\nBefore explaining the purpose of Baseline B, here is the recap of the all three Baselines. We will use examples of 10 images per class (IPC=10).\n- Baseline A: \n\t- The ultimate goal of this task, allowing **all subset** to have the same performance as directly condense to a dataset with specific IPC (Image Per Class).\n\t- **Approach**: conduct 10 separate condensations and obtain 10 different datasets.\n\t- The **purpose** is the provide an \'\'upper bound\'\' of the experimental result.\n- Baseline B: \n\t- **Approach**: Condense to 10 different datasets with IPC=1, construct large synthetic dataset using small IPC datasets.\n\t- **Purpose**: this approach **ensures** that the accuracy of the **smallest IPC** is preserved as opposed to preserving the accuracy of the largest IPC (Baseline C). The baseline B illustrates that combining many small datasets do not give comparable results on large IPC.\n- Baseline C:\n\t- **Approach**: traditional condensation approach.\n\t- **Purpose**: show the subset dagradation problem.\n\n The main reason we introduce Baseline-B is that it has the **same storage** as Baseline-C while addressing the subset degradation problem (accuracy of IPC1 is preserved). However, as illustrated in the experimental results, Baseline-B introduces another problem: using many small synthetic images to construct a big datasets does not give comparable results. **That it, Baseline-B has good performance when IPC is small, but fails when IPC is large.\n Baseline-C is the exact opposite, achieving good performance of large IPC, but fails at small one.**\n Therefore, the proposed method effectively address the problem from both sides, achieving good performance when both IPC is small and large.\n\n > 2. It\'s not clear why the freezing is used in MLS selection. If adaptive is good, why not just use adaptive method to choose the subset?\n\nAdaptive selection and Freezing serve for different purposes.\n- **adaptive selection**: it is not practical to incorporate the information of all IPC at the same time due to incurring more computations or slowing learning process. We use adaptive selection to find **one** IPC that is the most learnable. By adding information of **one** IPC at a time, the mentioned problem is addressed.\n- **freezing**: freezing aims to prevent the \'\'already learned"" images from being overwritten by information of large IPC. By extracting a smaller subset, ideally speaking, the subset should not contain information of larger IPCs, otherwise the performance will be affected.\n\n\n| Calculate | Compare | Freeze | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     | 10    | Avg.  |\n|-----------|---------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| -         | -       | -      | 27.49 | 38.50 | 45.29 | 50.85 | 53.60 | 57.98 | 60.99 | 63.60 | 65.71 | 67.50 | 53.15 |\n| â         | -       | -      | 49.35 | 48.27 | 50.00 | 52.30 | 54.20 | 58.29 | 60.90 | **63.63** | **65.90** | **67.63** | 57.08 |\n| â         | â       | -      | 40.12 | **54.91** | 56.02 | 56.12 | 56.18 | 59.74 | 61.68 | 63.41 | 65.56 | 67.01 | 58.08 |\n| â         | â       | â      | **49.55** | 53.75 | **56.39** | **59.33** | **58.13** | **60.62** | **62.06** | 63.59 | 65.25 | 66.79 | **59.55** |\n\nThis is the Tab. 2 from our paper, it shows the difference of condensation with (row 4) and without (row 3) freezing.\nRow 3 delivers a poorer performance, especially IPC=1 when compared to Row 4. \nThe issue is that performance of IPC1 is affected by large IPC since it is **not frozen** (keep receiving pixel updates according to larger IPC).\n\n> 3. Will the additional loss bring extra computational cost?\n\nYes, we provide an example in `Section. 4.3 More Analysis: Redcued Training Time Needed`.\nThe complete training of our method requires 30% more training time (**15.1 hrs** vs 11.5 hrs) on CIFAR-10 IPC10.\nHowever, to reach the average accuracy of the traditional approach, we only requires **0.6 hrs** compared to 11.5hrs (traditional approach).\nFig. 4 in the paper presents a visualization of the comparison.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'This paper introduces the Multisize Dataset Condensation problem that can derive multiple subsets from the condensed images for supporting on-device scenarios.

Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss.

Did the authors do a profiling for each model on all datasets, or each model on a single dataset.**\n\nA1: The profiling is run on every data instance (each sentence). For the same model, the profiling would be different if the input is different. So, we do the profiling on the fly during deployment. Such fine-grained flexible adaptation allows FastGen to reduce more memory footprint while preserving the model quality. We also provide more analysis on the overhead of profiling in Table 2 of **General Response**, which shows the cost is nearly negligible. \n\n**W2: the authors still need to discuss what if the structure of the attention map is not stable.**\n\nA2 We are not quite clear what the reviewers mean by ""the structure of the attention map is not stable"". We hypothesize that the reviewer was referring to the results in Figure 4, which shows the accumulated attention scores remain consistent/stable during the entire generation phase. The reviewer might be wondering if this observation can be generalized to all situations (e.g., different datasets and models). If that\'s the case, we think the reviewer raises a valid concern about FastGen, as some strategies such as static eviction policy (e.g., punctuation tokens) may no longer provide an accurate prediction, and more adaptive policies are needed.  To remedy this, we propose to repeat the diagnosis step multiple times across the generation process of one sentence. To be more specific, we choose a new pruning policy once the number of decoded tokens reaches $k$, where $k \\in$[1,sentence_len] is a predefined hyperparameter. For each sentence, the diagnosis is repeated for sentence_len//$k$ times. From the analysis in the second part of General Response, we could infer that the profiling overhead is relatively small even if it is repeated several times. On the other hand, it would be interesting to study the theoretic explanation of our observation, which we would like to explore in the future.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer BiHE'}, 'comment': {'value': '**W1: What is the overhead of book-keeping to support this adaptive and diverse ability based on the type of the attention? What is the added computational complexity both asymptotically as well experimentally?**\n\nA1: Thanks for the valuable advice. We provide extra experimental results on book-keeping overhead in **Table 2 of General Response**. Please refer to the second part of General Response for a detailed time and memory analysis of profiling cost. \n\nIn short, Table 2 shows the profiling time of the LLaMA65b in different generation length settings. We can observe that the profiling time only accounts for a very small percentage of the total generation duration, up to 0.35% in our tested cases. Also, the overhead decreases as the generation length increases, dropping to 0.07% when the generation length comes to 1024.\n\nIn terms of extra memory usage, itâs mainly introduced by one of the compression strategies, C_frequent, which needs to store an extra cumulative sum of attention scores for each attention head.  To provide a detailed analysis, for each layer, the dimension of the KV cache is (batch_size, num_of_head, sequence_len, hidden_dimension), while the dimension of extra memory for the cumulative attention scores is (batch_size, num_of_head, sequence_len). Considering hidden_dimension=128 for all model sizes, the memory overhead is 1/128=0.78% compared to storing KV cache only, which is a negligible cost.\n\nIn conclusion, the overhead introduced by the profiling step is nearly negligible in both time and memory, which confirms Fastgenâs potential for real-world deployment. We additionally provide end-to-end system latency improvement in Table 1. It shows that FastGen can achieve major speed-up in various generation settings. Please refer to the first part of General Response for more analysis.\n\n**W2: Table 3 shows an ablation on the policy order, why is this needed?  Is the policy fixed per layer and determined by the diagnosis step?**\n\nA2: The policy is determined in the diagnosis step, and it is fixed per head in each layer. As introduced in section 3.4 âHybrid Policiesâ, we search for the optimal hybrid policy according to a predefined order. The order is greedily designed to prioritize cache policy with smaller memory costs, e.g., C_special. Once the optimal policy is determined, it will stay fixed in the generation process.\n\nIn Table 3, the order ablation study aims to show that FastGen is agnostic to small changes in searching order. By shuffling the relative order of C_punct and C_local, we observe a different trade-off between KV cache compression and generation quality. Overall, our current order (as in Equation 2) achieves the highest win-rates.\n\n**W3: Another interesting exploration is long context tasks. In long context tasks, what can be the best set of eviction strategies and the corresponding expected win rates?**\n\nA3: Thanks for the suggestion, it points out a very promising area of extension for FastGen. Recent work such as StreamingLLM [1] and LM-Infinite [2] show that on long context tasks, preserving KV cache for special token and local contexts (C_special+C_local in our setting) could extend LLaMa-2 to 32k context length without significantly sacrificing performances. Although there is no clear experimental evidence on the optimal eviction ratio and corresponding win rates, their findings indicate that KV cache pruning could extend an LLM context length on-the-fly. It would be interesting to try out FastGen-style adaptive pruning on long context scenarios and measure performance and pruning ratio tradeoffs.\n\n[1] Xiao, Guangxuan, et al.

We are working on accommodating FastGen to GQA. In GQA, heads within each group share the same KV vectors. Instead of head-wise pruning, we could modify FastGen to perform group-wise pruning. Specifically, we could individually evaluate each query by calculating the recovery ratio of its attention map (Q*K), and then average ratios from all heads within the same group, using the averaged ratio as the criteria to find the optimal strategy for each group. As analyzed, adapting FastGen to GQA requires minimal methodology change and imposes little additional cost. We are working on obtaining concrete experimental results to show the effectiveness of GQA.\n\n**Q2: In Figure 4, attention scores of special tokens always take more than half. Are there attention heads whose special token score is lower than half?**\n\nA2: This is a very good observation. There are attention heads with special token scores less than half. In Figure 4, we only show two specific layers, i.e., 23 and 33. However, in Figure 3, we could find layers without special tokens as the dominant type, e.g., layer 1 and layer 80.\n\n**Q3: In Figure 5, compressing sometimes wins the full-cache strategy. How can we interpret such results?**\n\nA3: Thank you for mentioning this, we think the performance instability could be attributed to two aspects:\n1): Figure 5 presents win-rate changes, which are calculated from GPT-4âs pair-wise voting and thus could fluctuate due to the uncertainty in GPT-4 generation sampling. \n2): Small perturbations in KV cache may add some uncertainty to model performance, which could sometimes improve robustness and lead to slightly higher results.'}}, {'comment': {'value': '**W1.1: How long does inference take compared to the full-cache strategy?

Please refer to general response #1 for detailed settings and analysis.\n\nAs shown in Table 1, we can observe that FastGen achieves significant end-to-end speed-up across all the generation settings. For the least significant case, Fastgen can have a decent 16.04% latency improvement over the full-cache baseline on a short generation length of 512. In the best cases, we can achieve up to 55.0% latency reduction with Fastgen at a generation length of 16k. \nWe can also observe a clear and consistent tendency of larger relative speed-up as generation length becomes longer. For example, given batch_size = 1, FastGenâs relative speed-up rises from 16.04% to 55.0%, as the generation length grows from 512 to 16384. The phenomenon can also be observed in other batch settings. \n\nThis analysis confirms that FastGen can achieve major speed-up in real development, especially in long-generation settings. Meanwhile, the efficiency of the customized kernels can be further improved. We leave this unique research and engineering challenge to future works.\n\n**W1.2: How long does profiling take? Is it feasible for practical inference scenarios?**\n\nR1.2: To better understand the overhead of the profiling step, we compare the profiling time with the total generation time across different generation lengths. We present the result in Table 2. Please refer to general response #2 for detailed settings and analysis. \n\nTable 2 shows the profiling time of the LLaMA65b in different generation length settings.

We were not aware of it at the time of submission given it was posted after the ICLR deadline. After reading the paper, we think it is a great parallel work on long-context LLM, and we are happy to provide a comparison between it and FastGen! Generally, the two differ in two aspects:\n1) Goal and Setting: StreamingLLM aims to extend the context length of LLM, while FastGen aims to improve the efficiency of general LLM inference (normal+long contexts). As a result, FastGen focuses specifically on generation tasks, which is different from the general task settings in StreamingLLM.\n2) Method: StreamingLLM uses a fixed attention pruning strategy for all attention heads, while FastGen focuses on adaptively choosing different compression strategies according to the attention structure of each head.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer XPHq'}, 'comment': {'value': '**W1: The paper could benefit from presenting actual GPU inference performance and comparing them with other compression methods.**\n\nR1: Thanks for the valuable advice.

Since multi-query attention essentially eliminates all KV heads to one, it already eliminates the memory cost and inference time to a large extent, leaving the benefit of pruning the KV cache marginal. Moreover, it could be non-trivial to find a universal pruning strategy for all query heads so we leave the exploration for future work. However, we agree that it would be interesting to look into this setting.'}}, {'comment': {'value': '**W1: The compression policies are combined in a simple naive way in FastGen. This straightforward combination approach has several potential issues. First, is it possible that the union combination may introduce redundancy, as different policies could select overlapping important content? Second, is it possible that existing policies may not be fully compatible? Some combinations could introduce conflicts and hurt generation quality.**\n\nA1: We agree that different compression strategies have overlapping tokens. For example, C_frequent is sometimes overlapped with C_special and C_local, as special tokens and local contexts usually accumulate higher attention scores. However, FastGen is designed to progressively evict tokens. When there is an overlapped policy, we only consider the complementary tokens it contains. It is guaranteed that unioning the policy monotonously will only bring in newly evicted tokens.\nWe further confirm that different policies are compatible in the ablation study (section 5.3). We study (1) how removing one strategy and (2) how changing relative policy order affects the overall performance.\n\nWe can draw an empirical conclusion that little-to-no conflicts exist between different policies. In fact, we observe complementary effects between existing strategies. That is to say, the performance of standalone strategies can usually be boosted significantly by introducing other strategies when necessary.\n\nSome combinations can introduce inferior/superior performance than others. In our experiment, over all datasets, we find that following the order of  C_special, C_punct, C_frequen, C_local consistently gets the best performance. We leave investigating the intrinsic mechanism to future work.\n\n**W2: The experiments in the paper are all conducted on the decoder-only LLaMa models, without validation on encoder-decoder models like BART and T5.**\n\nA2: Thanks for the suggestion, FastGen could be easily adapted to encoder-decoder models by pruning the KV cache in their decoder. We will elaborate on this in the introduction and add several related works in the future version. In encoder-decoder models, KV cache is still used in the decoder to save computation. During generation, it is a standard practice to fix the encoder inputs as existing prompts or instructions, e.g., as in BART [1] and FlanT5 [2]. In such scenarios, the decoder part still works autoregressively to output newly generated tokens, and it is flexible to directly apply FastGen to their KV cache. In this paper, we focus on decoder-only models as most of the prevailing LLMs are decoder-only models, e.g., LLaMa, OPT, and GPT. We agree that additional discussions and experiments should be added, and we will revise accordingly.\n\n**W3: The paper lacks sufficient analysis on the overhead and time cost of conducting attention profiling, which is important to judge the efficiency of FastGen in real deployment.**\n\nA3: Thanks for the valuable advice.

Specifically, we adapt the kernel from Deepspeed by adding the KV cache sparsity operation.\nAll methods are tested on the same Nvidia V100 GPUs. \n\n**Table 1**: End-to-end latency comparison between Full-cache and FastGen on LLaMA7b. The column name ""Settings"" represents [Batch size, Prompt length, Generation length] tested. Each cell is the latency measured in seconds.\n\n| Settings | [1,32,512] | [1,32,2048] | [1,32,8192] | [1,32,16384] | [2,512,32] | [2,512,512] | [2,4096,4096] | [8,512,512] | [8,4096,4096] | [16,512,512] |\n| ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |\n| Full-cache               | 13.35      | 57.37       | 299.00      | 799.14       | 1.12       | 19.16       | 167.64        | 1.97        | OOM           | OOM          |\n| Fastgen (optimized ATTN) | 11.21      | 44.60       | 179.43      | 359.83       | 0.73       | 9.71        | 76.93         | 1.15        | 82.16         | OOM          |\n| Speed-up(%)              | 16.03%     | 22.3%       | 40.0%       | 55.0%        | 34.8%      | 49.3%       | 54.1%         | 41.6%       | \\-            | OOM          |\n\nAs shown in Table 1, we can observe that FastGen achieves significant end-to-end speed-up across all the generation settings. For the least significant case, Fastgen can have a decent 16.04% latency improvement over the full-cache baseline on a short generation length of 512. In the best cases, we can achieve up to 55.0% latency reduction with Fastgen at a generation length of 16k. \n\nWe can also observe that the relative speedup is greater with longer generation length. For example, given batch_size = 1, FastGenâs relative speed-up rises from 16.04% to 55.0%, as the generation length grows from 512 to 16k. The tendency can also be observed in other batch settings. \n\nThis analysis confirms that FastGen can achieve major speed-up in real development, especially in long generation settings. Meanwhile, the efficiency of the customized kernels can be further improved. We leave this unique research and engineering challenge to future works.\n\n# Updated Analysis on the Profiling Cost (Time+Memory)\nTo better understand the overhead of the profiling step, we compare the profiling time with the total generation time across different generation lengths. We present the result in **Table 2**.\n\n**Table 2**: Profiling time of LLaMA65b. The Overall Generation Duration is measured from the start of decoding to the end of the generation length. The Profiling Duration is measured from the start of the decoding until Fastgen finishes the policy search.\n| Generation Length | Overall Generation Duration (s) | Profiling Duration (s) | Profiling/Overall (%) |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |\n| 128               | 30.98                           | 0.11                   | 0.35%                 |\n| 256               | 50.10                           | 0.11                   | 0.21%                 |\n| 512               | 94.98                           | 0.11                   | 0.12%                 |\n| 1024              | 157.43                          | 0.11                   | 0.07%                 |\n\nTable 2 shows the profiling time of the LLaMA65b in different generation length settings. We can observe that the profiling time only accounts for a very small percentage of the total generation duration, up to 0.35% in our tested cases. Also, the overhead decreases as the generation length increases, dropping to 0.07% when the generation length comes to 1024.\n\nIn terms of extra memory usage, itâs mainly introduced by one of the compression strategies, C_frequent, which needs to store an extra cumulative sum of attention scores for each attention head.  To provide a detailed analysis, for each layer, the dimension of the KV cache is (batch_size, num_of_head, sequence_len, hidden_dimension), while the dimension of extra memory for the cumulative attention scores is (batch_size, num_of_head, sequence_len). Considering hidden_dimension=128 for all model sizes, the memory overhead is 1/128=0.78% compared to storing KV cache only, which is a negligible cost.\n\nIn conclusion, the overhead introduced by the profiling step is nearly negligible in both time and memory, which confirms FastGenâs potential for real deployment.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'This study introduces a lossy adaptive KV cache compression technique aimed at reducing the memory footprint of LLMs. The paper is guided by two key insights:\n\nDifferent attention heads typically exhibit distinct structures.\nThese attention head structures remain relatively consistent during inference.\nThe paper profiles the prompt encoding phase to identify the intrinsic structures of various attention heads and uses these structures to determine the optimal compression policy.

Perhaps the next milestone for generative models is to simulate realistic experience in response to actions taken by humans, robots, and other interactive agents. Applications of a real-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games and movies, to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directly deployed in the real world. We explore the possibility of learning a universal simulator (UniSim) of real-world interaction through generative modeling. We first make the important observation that natural datasets available for learning a real-world simulator are often rich along different axes (e.g., abundant objects in image data, densely sampled actions in robotics data, and diverse movements in navigation data). With careful orchestration of diverse datasets, each providing a different aspect of the overall experience, UniSim can emulate how humans and agents interact with the world by simulating the visual outcome of both high-level instructions such as âopen the drawerâ and low-level controls such as âmove by x,yâ from otherwise static scenes and objects. There are numerous use cases for such a real-world simulator. As an example, we use UniSim to train both high-level vision-language planners and low-level reinforcement learning policies, each of which exhibit zero-shot real-world transfer after training purely in a learned real-world simulator. We also show that other types of intelligence such as video captioning models can benefit from training with simulated experience in UniSim, opening up even wider applications.",Oral 1B,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=sFyTZEqmUY,https://openreview.net/forum?id=sFyTZEqmUY,sFyTZEqmUY,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'The paper has received positive reviews from the reviewers (8, 8, 8, 6).

We have expanded the discussion on the limitations of this work and included the following in the paper (conclusion section):\n\n- Hallucination. When an action is unrealistic given the scene (e.g., âwash handsâ is given to a tabletop robot), we observe hallucinations (e.g., the table turns into a sink or the view turning away from the tabletop robot and a sink shows up). Ideally, we want UniSim to detect actions that are not possible to simulate as opposed to Hallucinate unrealistic outcomes.\n- Limited memory. UniSim conditioned on a few frames of the recent history cannot capture long-term memory (e.g., an apple in a drawer could disappear when the drawer is opened if putting the apple in the drawer is not a part of the history for conditioning). How much history to condition on depends on the application of UniSim (e.g., whether UniSim will be used for policy learning in a near-Markov setting or question answering that requires long-term memory).\n- Limited out-of-domain generalization. This is especially true for domains that are not represented in the training data. For instance, UniSim is mostly trained on 4 robot morphologies, and its ability to generalize to an unseen robot is limited. Further scaling up training data could help, as UniSimâs training data is nowhere near all the video data available on the internet.\n- Visual simulation only. UniSim is not suitable for environments where actions do not cause visual observation change (e.g., different forces in grasping a static cup). A true universal simulator should capture all aspects of the world beyond visual experience (e.g., sound, sensory, etc)\nWe will work on releasing a code for doing inference with UniSim. We will try to open-source the UniSim model, but since the model is pretrained on private videos, we foresee challenges in this process.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author Response'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for noting the significance of this work! We provide answers to your questions below.\n\n> Out-of-domain generalization for robotics.\n\nWe note that because UniSim is only trained on 4 types of robots in fixed settings (e.g., in front of a cabinet, a tabletop with colored blocks), the out-of-domain generalization of UniSim is limited. We observe both success and failures (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tpInX4KUywXLt971Tr15_RsW8I_ytpvu/view?usp=sharing) applying UniSim to out-of-domain settings. We believe that training UniSim on more diverse robotic datasets (e.g., RT-X [1]) can potentially mitigate this limitation.

We provide examples (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AiMFfCEPIL2GXIYXu2qDThvtXzV2I4-o/view?usp=sharing) where UniSim can visually simulate the end-effector actions reasonably well. We note that these low-level control action conditioned models require more rigorous evaluation such as being used to train policies.

Texts, cartesian coordinates, and end-effectors are all examples of such shared action spaces.\n\n> Conditioned on robot action, the robot arm needs to be visible in the first place?\n\nThe robot arm does not need to be visible to simulate, for instance, the ego-centric view from a robot's wrist view, which is quite similar to ego-centric videos with camera settings converted to actions. Here is an example (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EBqTpONGMyF9ZZCHA9kEAxnR_Yu9ewGY/view?usp=sharing) simulation of a robotâs wrist view while stacking blocks.\n\n[1] Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning Datasets and RT-X Models.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author Response'}, 'comment': {'value': '> 4. Additional ablations.\n\nThank you for pointing out this weakness of the paper. In addition to adding the ablation of dataset diversity in Appendix E.1 and additional qualitative examples, we also conducted an ablation on the model size in Appendix E.2: \n\n| Model size | FVD | CLIP |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| 500M | 277.85 | 22.08 |\n| 1.6B | 224.61 | 22.27 |\n| 5.6B   |   **211.30**     | **22.63** |\n\nWe found that while increasing the model size improves the video modeling performance, the amount of improvement measured by FrÃ©chet Video Distance (FVD) plateaus as the model gets bigger, which is slightly disappointing from a scaling point of view.\n\n> 5.1 Confusion around the POMDP formulation.\n\nThank you for pointing out the confusion. We have reformulated UniSim as an observation prediction model $p(o_t | h_{t-1}, a_{t-1})$ in Section 2.2 (Page 4), where $h_{t-1}$ denoting the history up to time $t-1$ corresponds to the belief state in a POMDP. Under this formulation, sampling from $p(o_t | h_{t-1}, a_{t-1})$ corresponds to doing rollouts in the POMDP. We also provided motivation for this formulation (i.e., directly learning the POMDP requires learning distributions over $s_t$, which is difficult). We also clarified that in the POMDP of the real world, the frequency and duration of interactions vary (e.g., a human opens a door in 2 seconds, a motor executing a robot control in 0.2 second), so $o_t$ is a set of (variable length) frames and $a_t$ is a set of (variable length) control sequences or some high-level text actions. For data from most environments, we use the last four frames of $o_{t-1}$ for conditional generation of $o_t$. However, when $o_t$ only consists of a single frame, we condition on $o_{t-4},...,o_{t-1}$ to generate $o_t$, as both the last 4 frames of $o_{t-1}$ and $o_{t-4},...,o_{t-1}$ are specific instantiations of $h_{t-1}$.\n\n> 5.2 Why the model conditions on the noised, rather than clean, previous observations.\n\nThe model is conditioned on the *clean* previous observations concatenated with the noise samples for the next set of observations. We made the wrong choice to call this concatenation the noisy previous observation, which has now been corrected.\n\n> 6. Model details in main body as opposed to Appendix C.\n\nWe added a paragraph summarizing the architecture and training on Page 5 and point the rest of the architecture and training details to the appendix.\n\n> 7. Limited algorithmic novelty.\n\nThe creation of UniSim did involve innovations around how to leverage diverse datasets, how to condition on past information in diffusion models, and how to handle actions at different levels of  abstraction. We think many algorithmic aspects of generative models are already there; a lot of room for innovations lies in how to scale up (e.g., combing datasets) and properly use generative models for tasks (e.g., through RL, planning, and generating training data).\n\n> 8. Out-of-domain performance.\n\nUniSim exhibits limited out-of-domain performance with both success and failure cases (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tpInX4KUywXLt971Tr15_RsW8I_ytpvu/view?usp=sharing). We believe that training UniSim on more diverse robotic datasets (e.g., RT-X [1]) and scale up the data to more internet videos can potentially mitigate this limitation. We made note of this limitation in the conclusion section of the paper.\n\n> 9. Wordy dataset description.\n\nWe made that section more concise highlighting different information covered in each dataset (the main point of that section). Thanks for the suggestion for including the dataset table in the main text, we will take this into account in final version.\n\n> 10. 512 TPUs with batch size 256.\n\nThe model is large and we needed model parallelism, and hence the small batch size. The video modeling metrics converged with 1M steps.\n\n> Clock time and parameter.\n\nUniSim has 5.6B parameters required 20 TPU days to train with 512 TPU-v3. We now report that in the paper (Page 5).\n\n> Open-source.\n\nWe will try to open-source, but since the model is pretrained on private videos, we foresee challenges in this process.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author Response'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for the detailed and constructive feedback! We answer your questions below and in the updated paper. Please let us know if you have additional questions.\n\n> 1.1 Novelty in relation to prior model-based RL work.\n\nWhile UniSim shares similarities with model based RL, model-based RL generally focuses on single-task settings and often do not use rollouts in the pixel space for policy optimization. UniSim focuses on learning a general purpose simulator that can be used for a variety of purposes such as serving as environments for manipulation and navigation, supporting human-AI interaction, generating data for VLMs, etc. More importantly, existing model-based methods have yet to achieve good real-world simulation results in the pixel space, so it is hard to call them âInteractive Real-World Simulatorsâ as in our title.\n\n> 1.2 Concerns around method name.\n\nWe were aware that our naming choice of 'universal simulator' could lead to concerns about overclaiming, similar to some other naming choices such as 'generalist agent.' However, we wanted to take a forward-looking stance when we chose this name, as UniSim demonstrates considerable potential in using internet data to simulate the universe, indicating that such an ambitious goal is achievable. We are open to renaming the method if reviewers generally agree that a less ambitious name is more favorable.\n\n> 1.3 Novelty in establishing the connection between video generation and POMDPs.\n\nThank you for noting that Micheli et al. have previously established this connection. We have reformulated UniSim as an observation prediction model that approximates sampling in a POMDP. This formulation allows us to use multi-frame history conditioning to produce consistent long-horizon videos. We have also updated the second contribution bullet in the introduction.\n\n> 2. Effect of diverse datasets.\n\nThank you for pointing out the lack of dataset analysis in the current version of the paper. We conducted ablation studies on the effect of diverse datasets, and included the following table in Appendix E.1:\n| Dataset | FVD | CLIP |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Internet only | 219.62 | 22.27 |\n| UniSim without internet | 307.80 | 21.99 |\n| UniSim   |   **211.30**     | **22.63** |\n\nWe found combining internet data with various human activity and robot data results in the best FVD and CLIP scores on a held-out test split, whereas only using internet data (last row in Table 5) or not including internet data (all except for last row in Table 5) leads to worse performance. We further provide more qualitative examples (https://drive.google.com/file/d/174qUvW8fUxvKBVv3UV4m2yZ8y3v6gMW6/view?usp=sharing) where training on entire UniSim data is better than using internet-only data or without internet data. In terms of using downstream RL and planning to evaluate the effect of diverse data, we trained a video model only on Language Table as suggested by the reviewer, but we did not observe significant performance differences between UniSim and this task-specific video model in Table 2 and Table 3. Our hypothesis is that Language Table is a simple domain and already has a lot of data, so training a domain-specific video model is sufficient, but this is not true in general for harder environments.\n\n> 3.1 Entwined actions and videos.\n\nWe found that actions are generally not entwined with videos in the training distribution; we can apply diverse actions to scenes as long as such actions are reasonable. As the reviewer requested, we generate various egocentric movements in the kitchen scene (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HhvJIOlA2TAotZiRrt0CHVkgjc0kEQH2/view?usp=sharing) from Figure 3, including look up, look down, zoom in, zoom out, etc. We see that the generated videos generally follow the actions, but the videos might look less realistic when the actions are less reasonable (e.g., zooming out from a personâs view looking down at the kitchen table). We also generated some diverse interactions with objects (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MWzWOHpeC9etJsW6gZXHm2q2E8DKyR24/view?usp=sharing).\n\n> 3.2 Dataset name as a part of action label.\n\nNote that we only used dataset name for dataset with very few videos (habitat), as it helped the model identify the domain better. We think this may not be needed if we tune the data mixture ratio during pretraining. For all the other datasets, we donât use dataset name, so that language actions from different datasets can generalize across domains.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author Response'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the feedback.

However, there are two main issues I believe should first be addressed. I\'ve set my score relatively low because of these, but anticipate increasing it following a revised version.\n\n1) Whilst it\'s difficult to accuse the paper of overclaiming in any specific place, the writing and framing risk feeling a little showy. The title is very general, and applies to any paper on model-based RL for the real-world rather than something specific to this paper, and naming the method a ""universal simulator"" feels grandiose. (Happy to collect other revewiers\' opinions on this.) The connection between POMDP\'s and action-conditioned video generation is more-or-less assumed by any world model paper (e.g. [1]), and shouldn\'t be highlighted as a main contribution of the paper.\n2) One of the recurring claims throughout the paper is that the major novelty is UniSim\'s ""orchestration of diverse datasets, each providing a different aspect of the overall experience"" into a single model. Yet no hard evidence is given for this combination being important -- aside from two vague figures in Appendix E. At a minimum, it would be important to train a version of UniSim on say, datasets from the Language Table environment _only_, and report numbers for when synthetic data was generated from this, in Table 2 and 3. This would help support the claim that dataset diversity is valuable.\n\nOther issues (in decreasing priority)\n- I think it\'d be useful to investigate how entwined the effect of actions is with the dataset distribution. For example, could camera commands (zoom in etc) successfully be applied to kitchen scenes as in Figure 3? The fact that the name of the dataset had to be included as part of the action during training, makes me suspect actions may not be able to generalise well to new kinds of video. This would not be a dealbreaker for the paper\'s acceptance, but is important to show readers how general this data mixing is.\n- A lack of strong baselines might be expected for this kind of scale-up work. But in their absence, ablations become more important, to verify that the various components of the model were all necessary. The paper only presents a brief study of which frames to condition on.\n- The model section is poorly written. The use of $\\mathcal{T}$ is (I think) slightly misleading -- usually the transition fn of a POMDP is defined as operating on the states, $\\mathcal{T}(s_t,a_t) \\to s_{t+1}$, and there is a separate emission function producing the observations, $p(o_t|s_t)$. Eq. 1 implicitly combines these -- I might recommend renaming it $f$ or $g$ or whatever. I didn\'t follow why $o_l$ notation needed to be introduced, since it\'s immediately unrolled into $[o_t, o_{t+1}]$ and never referred to again. I also didn\'t understand why the model conditions on the noised, rather than clean, previous observations. It\'s said the last four frames are concatenated from $o_{t-1}$, which confused me -- does $o_{t-1}$ represent four frames, or should it read $o_{t-1:t-4}$ or similar?\n- It\'s a shame to give the model details only in the Appendix C, as I believe many readers would be interested in them. I hope some of these can be shifted to the main body, particularly key details around the diffusion architecture (such as the core and super-resolution modules) and the amount of compute required.\n- Any algorithmic or model novelty is light (more or less straightforward video diffusion).\n- The two main experiments were conducted on environments that were within the training distribution of UniSim. It would have been more impressive to investigate the performance on new environments.\n- The wordy description of all datasets in 2.1, I felt was much better summarized by Table 5 in the Appendix (perhaps with the addition of a column explaining how an action space is defined and handled), and might be swapped. (Optional!)\n\nMinor issues/questions\n- Appendix says 1M steps on 512 TPUs with batchsize 256 -- this seemed a low ratio of training updates to available compute.

Perhaps the next milestone for generative models is to simulate realistic experience in response to actions taken by humans, robots, and other interactive agents. Applications of a real-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games and movies, to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directly deployed in the real world. We explore the possibility of learning a universal simulator (UniSim) of real-world interaction through generative modeling. We first make the important observation that natural datasets available for learning a real-world simulator are often rich along different axes (e.g., abundant objects in image data, densely sampled actions in robotics data, and diverse movements in navigation data). With careful orchestration of diverse datasets, each providing a different aspect of the overall experience, UniSim can emulate how humans and agents interact with the world by simulating the visual outcome of both high-level instructions such as âopen the drawerâ and low-level controls such as âmove by x,yâ from otherwise static scenes and objects. There are numerous use cases for such a real-world simulator. As an example, we use UniSim to train both high-level vision-language planners and low-level reinforcement learning policies, each of which exhibit zero-shot real-world transfer after training purely in a learned real-world simulator. We also show that other types of intelligence such as video captioning models can benefit from training with simulated experience in UniSim, opening up even wider applications.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'applications to robotics, autonomy, planning'}, 'code_of_ethics': {'value': 'I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.'}, 'submission_guidelines': {'value': 'I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.'}, 'anonymous_url': {'value': ""I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.""}, 'no_acknowledgement_section': {'value': 'I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.'}, 'venue': {'value': 'ICLR 2024 oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'ICLR.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/ebbd0d77e65c2e2ffb1eef300c8c55e4f2f27c86.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\nyang2024learning,\ntitle={Learning Interactive Real-World Simulators},\nauthor={Sherry Yang and Yilun Du and Seyed Kamyar Seyed Ghasemipour and Jonathan Tompson and Leslie Pack Kaelbling and Dale Schuurmans and Pieter Abbeel},\nbooktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\nyear={2024},\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=sFyTZEqmUY}\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'yang|learning_interactive_realworld_simulators'}}]"
"['Akari Asai', 'Zeqiu Wu', 'Yizhong Wang', 'Avi Sil', 'Hannaneh Hajishirzi']",ICLR,"Self-RAG_ Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection",https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/oral/19736,2024," Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG) that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its generations using special tokens, called {\it reflection} tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA, reasoning, and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models. Our code and trained models are available at https://selfrag.github.io/",Oral 2A,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=hSyW5go0v8,https://openreview.net/forum?id=hSyW5go0v8,hSyW5go0v8,"[{'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'This paper introduces Self-RAG a LLM with ""action tokens"" (reflection tokens) that, when generated by the model, cause a ""scaffolding program"" to take certain actions.

However, the results in Table 2 are dominated by ChatGPT and Ret-ChatGPT. They only get outperformed in PopQA. \n\nOur abstract mentioned that Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT on open-domain QA and fact verification tasks, which is supported by the results on PopQA and PubHealth. We will make it more explicit and clear in our updated abstract. \nWe also would like to note that following the suggestions weâve received, we explored the effectiveness of increasing the training data scale up to 150k (See more details in Section 5.2. Effects of training data) and we show further gains across many tasks (Table 2). \n\n### **Human evaluations on GPT-4 Self-reflection predictions**\n> **(Question 2)** The authors claim that ""GPT-4 reflection token predictions show high agreement with human evaluations"". I find that hard to believe, given personal experience and reported results, e.g. PandaLM which for their task reports an F1 accuracy of 66% when comparing the quality of different passages. I don\'t deny that GPT-4 evaluation predictions have a strong positive bias towards the truth, but I still would call it high agreement. Do you have data to support this? Or do you think the gap in observations is due to comparison on slightly different evaluation tasks?\n\nThanks for sharing the experience and insights from PandaLM. In our work, we sampled 50 examples per type (Retrieve, IsRel, IsSUP, isUse), manually labeled the reflection tokens (e.g., relevant or irrelevant for `IsRel`), and then compared the GPT-4 predictions on the same examples against human labels. We will release our human evaluation data upon acceptance. \n\nWe believe that the different outcomes primarily come from different evaluation setups. \n\nTo our knowledge, PandaLM evaluation (PandaLM Section 4) is a pairwise preference evaluation given two LLM outputs and comparing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 against human annotations. Pairwise overall preference evaluations among two responses often exhibit relatively high disagreement even among humans ([Dubois et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14387)) due to the subjective nature of this evaluation.  \n\nIn our evaluation, we formulate the evaluations (1) in a fine-grained way (multiple aspects, segment level) and (2) ask GPT-4 to give an absolute class label/score, rather than rank multiple responses. This allows the model to focus on a narrow yet precisely defined aspect of generation and evaluate it using a rubric, rather than dynamically comparing two given paragraphs. We found that this gives more stable and reliable evaluation results, reducing the subjectivity of evaluations. We added discussions in Appendix Section A.1 (Manual analysis of the GPT-4 predictions). Such effectiveness of fine-grained evaluations has been also reported by recent work ([Wu et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01693)) \nWe will release our GPT-4 prompting as well as our Critic LM inference scripts to enables for future reproducibilities. \n\n### **Questions about Inference time cost**\n> **(Question 3)** The repetitive self-reflection methods of Self-RAG will likely have an outsized effect on the computation requirements and the latency of the model\n\nRegarding the generation stage, we introduced several techniques to reduce computaional overhead and improve effieicny (parallel batch decoding of multiple passages, beam search, paged attentions). As a result, at each segment generation, we believe the introduced latency is still limited, and we use the same computation for other baselines (a single GPU with 24GB memory). \nFor retrieval part, Self-RAG can also skip and reduce rerieval frequencies from normal RAG. \nWhile multi-step retrieval intorudces efficiency-performance trade-off, as discussed by [Jiang et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06983), we would like to note that Self-RAG can continue using the same passages retrieved previously, and thus often retrieves less than three times for long-form generations. \n\nWe will add more discussions and analysis on those aspects in our final version.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer quEF (2/3)'}, 'comment': {'value': '### **Performance deterioration with RAG in baselines (cont.)**\n\n> **(Weakness 2)** I have a similar (but less important) observation for the Alpaca models (specifically 13B). I can understand the reduced MAUVE score, but accuracy on PubMed has also been reduced which tells a similar story\n\nWhether retrieval helps or not on non-extractive tasks such as multiple choice or classification is still an open question [(BehnamGhader et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09146), unlike tasks like Open-domain QA, where a system can simply extract or copy subspace in the context. For PubMed or ARC-Challenge, LMs often need to reason over the input sequences and paragraphs, and the retrieved evidence may not directly answer the questions. Standard LMs such as Alpaca are not trained with retrieved passages and we suspect they may struggle to leverage such retrieved passages in those tasks. To build versatile and reliable retrieval-augmented LMs, we believe training with retrieved passages and explicit feedback from such fine-grained aspects as in Self-RAG is important. Note that Self-RAG shows improvements from retrieval from its non-retrieval baselines in ablation.  \n\n> Same is true in Figure 3.a (ablations) where Self-RAG without retrieval is already better than all the other baselines in Table 2. Is this because there has been a data leak? If yes, that completely invalidates these results\n\nFirst, our Llama2-FT baseline in the Table is trained on the same input-output data as Self-RAG and uses retrieval at inference time, and still lags behind Self-RAG, which supports the strong Self-RAG performance does not simply come from data. The training data includes a diverse set of source datasets Alpaca-Instruct, Open Assistant as well as KILT FEVER, NQ, and WoW, and thereâs no dataset leakage. Also ChatGPT and LLama2-chat, we do not know their training details and they may or may not be trained on the evaluation datasets. Nevertheless, our proposed method outperforms LLama2-chat by a large margin, and matches or outperforms ChatGPT on the evaluated tasks. \n\n### **Prompting-based methods for Self-RAG**\n> **(Weakness 1)** I would have also liked to see at least an attempt at trying to combine self reflection with RAG without any pre-training\n\nThanks for the great suggestions! Although we believe developing a prompt-based approach to achieve Self-RAG-like inference is an existing idea, we found learning-based method may be more suitable to achieve the fine-grained feedback-based inference process for the following reasons.\n\n- Self-RAG requires careful multi-aspect fine-grained self-evaluations at inference time. As shown in Tables 8-12, to make an LM comprehend fine-grained aspects and scoring systems, precise and detailed instructions as well as few-shot demonstrations are necessary. This significantly increases the input sequence length, resulting in higher costs and latency.\n- Nevertheless, we briefly tried prompting-based approaches in our preliminary experiments and found it is nontrivial. When we combine all instructions for all aspects and feed them to the target pre-trained LMs (GPT-3 davinci-003 / 002, Llama2-13B-chat), all models struggle to precisely follow our evaluation scheme, often generating output formats that do not suit our scheme or whose reflections show high disagreement with human, due to the confusions between dozens of special tokens.\n- To make the most use of the Self-RAG potential, we need to use the token probabilities for the reflection tokens, which may not be always available for black box proprietary LM APIs. Note that at the time of submission, ChatGPT and GPT-4 do not provide log probability information via API, preventing us from applying the Self-RAG algorithm to such models. This limitation is also discussed in the [Active Retrieval (Jiang et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06983) paper, which also requires access to token probabilities.\n\nWhile several concurrent or recent work uses proprietary LMs to conduct self-evaluation during inference, most work only considers one aspect during generation, and it is indeed nontrivial how we can make models to conduct fine-grained multi-aspect evaluations. That being said, exploring Self-RAG-like inference algorithms on top of proprietary LLMs without training is interesting and a natural follow-up.

Below, we address your questions and concerns. \n\n### **More ablations to understand Self-RAG effectiveness**\n\n> **(Weakness 1)** Specifically, I'd like to separate out the contribution from the main two parts of the approach, the self-reflection, and RAG. I don't see much ablation or comparison on the self-reflection side. Only the IsSup token is ablated and that it.\n> I believe simple changes to prompt, number of topk to retrieve, and order of retrieval (top first or top last) can produce highly nuanced results.\n\nWe appreciate your insightful suggestions. Following your questions, we conducted a set of new experiments and analyses. In our final version, we will expand this analysis to other datasets and incorporate it into our main pages. Also we would like to clarify that as shown in Figure 1 and Section 3, Self-RAG processes multiple documents in parallel by batch decoding, and thus there is no order of documents. \n\n**Ablations on other special tokens**\n\nWe conduct ablation studies of different aspects on sampled 500 PopQA, on top of our 7B model trained on 150K queries.  \nBelow. âXâ indicates the special tokens used during inference, and `sequence` indicates the sequence score (p(y_t | x_t, p) in Eq. 3). \nRemoving isREL only gives minor deterioration possibly `isSUP` also implicitly evaluates how relevant the passage is (e.g., if the passage is not relevant, Self-RAG predicts `no support` or `contradictory) while removing both `isREL` and `isSUP` gives notable drops, indicating the importance of those two aspects. Completely removing all of the fine-grained aspects and only using sequence scores for ranking also causes significant deterioration. The biggest drops happen when we use isUse only for ranking outputs. isUse only evaluates the overall quality of generations, regardless of factuality of generations or document relevance and thus depending on this aspect only may not be suitable for knowledge-intensive tasks such as QA. \n\n| `IsRel` | `IsSup` | `IsUse`| `sequence` | PopQA performance (acc.)  |\n| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |----------- |----------- |\n|x |x |x |x | 0.538|\n| |x |x |x | 0.536|\n| | |x |x | 0.512 |\n| | |x | | 0.416|\n|  |  | |x | 0.512|\n\n\n**Ablations on the number of passages**\n\nWe also conduct evaluations on the varying number of passages on PopQA. The table below shows the results. Adding more passages helps our models to increase performance up to 10 passages, while at N=15 and 20, we see minor performance drops, perhaps because a model may get confused with irrelevant documents, which have been reported by prior work. \n\n| The number of passages (N=2) | PopQA performance (acc.) |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|   2    | 0.498       |\n|3 | 0.504 |\n|5 | 0.504 |\n| 7 | 0.540 |\n|10 | 0.538 |\n| 15 | 0.528 |\n|20 | 0.520 | \n\n**Prompts**\n\nTable 5 provides the individual task prompts. Note that we directly feed Open-domain QA queries without any task prompt. We briefly tried different task prompts for PubHealth on top of our 7B model, but we didnât observe major performance changes on this dataset. \n\n### **Performance deterioration with RAG in baselines**\n\n> **(Weakness 2)** ChatGPT performs better than the retrieval-augmented version. This is curious and tells me either the model has seen the data (which makes the dataset slightly not a good representative of the RAG task) or that RAG is not being done correctly.\n\nWe note that ChatGPT is under a family of closed LLMs as we're unaware of its pre-training and instruction / RLHF data, and thus it is hard for us to make claims which datasets are contaminated. \n\nRegarding the performance deterioration on some tasks by retrieval, we suspect this comes from the fundamental limitations of the current RAG systems, and the findings align with recent and concurrent work. \nRecent work ([Mallen et al., 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.546/); [Kandpal et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08411)) shows that strong LMs memorize a lot of popular factual knowledge, although it can struggle in long-tail (rare entities) knowledge, and benefit more from retrieval-augmentation in such long-tail. \nTriviaQA often includes queries about popular factual knowledge, leading to the strong ChatGPT performance. \n\nHowever, existing LMs including ChatGPT can also get easily distracted, when the prompted passages are not relevant. On popular entities, the retrieval system may fail to retrieve helpful passages and make ChatGPT generate errorneous outputs. This is also reported by [Mallen et al., (2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.546/) and ([anonynous. (2023)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZS4m74kZpH)). \n\nSelf-RAG addresses such limitations by novel methodologies, as acknowledged by reviewers 3ScW, 4MCy and uRop. Also we will make Self-RAG as well as all baselines available for the NLP community to test the methodology with different open LLMs for RAG on diverse tasks.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer 3ScW [2/2]'}, 'comment': {'value': ""### **Ablations on the number of passages and different types of reflections**\n> **(Weakness 3)** In the ablation study, the paper only investigates 'Retrieve top1,' while SELF-RAG utilizes top 5 or top 10.

Below, we address your questions and weaknesses. \n\n### **Reflection token distributions and their effects on training**\n> **(Question 1)** Did the authors investigate the influence of reflection token distributions on the performance of the critic model?\n\nIn our initial training, we noticed that reflection token distributions can be biased towards certain classes in some datasets, which can make our Generator LM learn to exploit certain task formats. For instance, in Open QA, thereâs a much higher percentage of ârelevantâ and âfully supportedâ passages while in long-form instruction-following datasets, retrieved passages are often only partially supported by the outputs. \n\nTo balance the distributions of the reflection tokens, we carefully design a sampling process, to make it match natural distributions when a system is used in information-seeking instruction-following scenarios. In particular, we introduce two heuristics that alter the reflection token distributions. \n- When we aggregate the augmented datasets from different input-output data sources, we downsample and discard 50% of the instances without any retrieval tokens, since large-scale instruction-following datasets (e.g., Alpaca), include many queries that do not require retrieval (e.g., simple and easy facts or not knowledge intensive). \n- For instances for the queries requiring retrieval, we first retrieve 5-10 paragraphs for each segment and sample only 1 paragraph for the segment following the process described below: \n1. For all datasets except for open-domain QA (NQ), if there is one or more than one paragraph with `[relevant]` and `[fully supported]`,  we randomly sample one from such paragraphs. For NQ, we randomly discard such cases at 25% cases, as we found NQ shows a significantly higher percentage of ârelevantâ and âfully supportedâ and the subset can be easily dominated by such âpositiveâ samples.\n2. When none of the passages are relevant and fully supported while we have some passages partially supported, we take the highest ranked passages from this category at 30% of the cases. \n3. When none of the passages are relevant but have no support, we take the highest-ranked passages from this category at 75% of the cases. \nFor the remaining cases, we randomly sample 1 from all irrelevant paragraphs. \n\nWe added the detailed description in Section A.3 and will release the processing script upon acceptance. Due to the short time of the rebuttal process, we are unable to re-train models on different distributions of the training data. However, we conducted brief experiments in the early stages, and we observed that without up and downsampling, model predictions can be biased towards certain categories (e.g., many passages marked as âRelevantâ in a QA dataset).  \n\n> **(Question 2)** Is there a possibility that the critic model may exhibit certain biases? \n\nOur careful sampling process reduces undesirable biases (e.g., overpredictions of ârelevanceâ for a QA-like evaluation dataset). \nWe also noticed that the Critic model learns to generate accurate predictions on when retrieval is helpful, resulting in different distributions across instances from different seed datasets. Below, we provide the percentage of instances with [Retrieve] tokens on four representative seed datasets: FLAN, Stanford Alpaca, Natural Questions, and FEVER. \n\n|      | FLAN |Stanford Alpaca |NQ | FEVER|\n| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |----------- |----------- |\n|% of instances with [Retrieve]      | 15.8%       | 53.3% | 87.7% | 63.2%|\n\n- We found that particularly on FLAN, many instances are labeled as âno retrieval neededâ. Such data includes grammatical checking, and replacing a character in a given sentence, which aligns our intuition that such instances may not require retrieval. \n- Among those four datasets, NQ shows the highest percentage of instances and shows a much higher percentage than FEVER. We found that in FEVER there are many instances where even without external evidence the model can easily judge the truthfulness of statements (*Gary Ridgway's last name is Leon*, which is obviously false from the surface only), while on NQ created from Google usersâ search queries, many questions are information-seeking and require fine-grained world knowledge. \nThis indicates the Criticâs prediction reliability of judging when to retrieve. \n\n> Additionally, have they examined the distribution of retrieval tokens and its correlation with the retrieval threshold?\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, we show retrieval threshold and retrieval frequencies on PubHealth (Fact verification) and PopQA (Open QA). As you can see, PopQA requires more retrieval while PubHealth requires less. PopQA consists of many rare entities that strong LLMs often struggle to memorize (Mallen et al., 2023) and thus our model generates more âretrievalâ tokens for this dataset.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer 4MCy (3/3)'}, 'comment': {'value': '### **Abilities of handling multiple passages**\n> **(Weakness 3)** One limitation of the proposed Self-RAG is that the model sees each passage independent from the others.

Still, Self-RAG continues generating based on multiple passages during the whole response generations, which we believe partially addresses this concern to some extentâ-For instance, to compare two concepts, Self-RAG can retrieve a passage about Concept A and generate at the first time step, then retrieve another passage about Concept B and generates conditioned on the first segment as well as Concept B. \nWhile still there are some cases where such multi-step generations may not address, we found the batch decoding conditioned on multiple paragraphs independently gives us optimal trade-off between efficiency and performance, as well as better attributions i.e., we predict relevance as well as supported tokens for each paragraph.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer 4MCy (2/3)'}, 'comment': {'value': '### **Amount of training data**\n\n**Sampling**\n\nFor our current Self-RAG, we first sample many input-output pairs, and then run Critic & retrieve passages.

When we insert a single passage for an output segment, we prioritize the passages that are relevant and provide full support to the succeeding output over irrelevant or contradictory passages, while we intentionally sample irrelevant or no support passages for an Open QA dataset (NQ), where often we have a higher proportion of fully supported passages.

E.g., ""Active retrieval augmented generation."" by Jiang et al [1]. It would be nice to study what benefits the offline data augmentation & training approach can bring compared to these prompting-based frameworks.\n\nThis work investigates a learning-based approach to improve retrieval-augmented LMs, in contrast to prior work prompting strong black-box LMs. We found this is more suitable to achieve the Self-RAG style inference process for the following reasons. \n- Self-RAG requires careful multi-aspect fine-grained self-evaluations at inference time.

Among our evaluation tasks, ARC-Challenge is also considered as a reasoning task, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of ARC. \nInvestigating the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generations in reasoning, creativity or instruction-following is a great avenue to explore for future work. Some recent work shows that retrieval-augmented approaches can enhance reasoning tasks by finding closely relevant few-shot demonstrations from the training dataset.

It would be nice to show the triggering rates of ""retrieval"" to different types of tasks.\n\nFigure 3 (C) shows how frequently retrieval is triggered across different thresholds. Given the same threshold (0.5), PopQA triggers retrieval 70% of the time while PubHealth retrieves less than 20%. This is because PopQA includes many long-tal, rare entity questions that require retrieval more. \n\nWe also analyze the Critic modelsâ predictions across different seed instruction-following datasets used during training. Below, we present the percentage of instances with `[Retrieve]=Yes` tokens for four representative subsets. \nFLAN and Stanford Alpaca consist of a diverse set of instruction-output pairs; FLAN data is collected from diverse existing benchmarks while Alpaca data is generated by GPT-3 davinci 003). NQ (short-form generation) and FEVER (classification) are knowledge-intensive tasks that often require factual knowledge. \n\n|      | FLAN |Stanford Alpaca |NQ | FEVER|\n| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |----------- |----------- |\n|% of instances with [Retrieve]      | 15.8%       | 53.3% | 87.7% | 63.2%|\n\n- We found that particularly on FLAN-T5, many instances are labeled as âno retrieval neededâ. Such data includes grammatical checking, and replacing a character in a given sentence, which aligns our intuition that such instances may not require retrieval. \n- Among those four datasets, NQ shows the highest percentage of instances and shows a much higher percentage than FEVER. We found that in FEVER there are many instances where even without external evidence the model can easily judge the truthfulness of statements (*Gary Ridgway\'s last name is Leon*, which is obviously false), while on NQ created from Google usersâ search queries, many questions are information-seeking and require fine-grained world knowledge. \n\nThose qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate our Critic and Generator LMs show their great capabilities of identifying which instances can benefit from retrieval, instead of merely depending on certain task instruction formats. \n\n### **Amount of training data**\n> 3. How much training data is needed? Does the training data need to be carefully sampled, e.g., focusing on fact-seeking slices?\n\nWe believe that task diversity during Self-RAG is crucial to building a robust Self-RAG system that is not factual and competitive on knowledge-intensive tasks but also retains the versatile capabilities of LLMs. We collect seed instruction-output data from 11 different seed datasets and then augment training data using Crticic and Retriever. We heuristically sample training data to balance reflection token distributions. While even with 50K training instances, Self-RAG outperforms other models, we further scaled up training data to 150K and found it gives us notable improvements.  We will open source scripts so that follow-up work can explore more training sizes or combinations of training datasets. Below, we provide more details on those aspects. \n\n**Amount of training data** \n\nAs we can leverage existing instruction-output pairs and do not rely on external expensive APIs such as GPT-4 after training the Critic model, scaling up the training data is fairly straightforward in the Self-RAG framework. Since the initial version using 50k training data, we have created more training data using the same protocol and conducted ablations of the model performance trained on different numbers of training data. While our initial model trained on 50k instances already shows strong performance, we found that increasing training data to 150k instances gives large improvements, especially on some tasks. See Figure 4 in our updated draft. Note that widely used instruction-tuning LMs are often trained on more than 100k instances (e.g., Vicuna).'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer uRop (2/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': '### **Generating training data using GPT-4**\n> **(Weaknesses 2)** If GPT-4 somehow can decently provide the labeled data required for each reflection step, it seems intuitive to just instruct GPT-4 to obtain the ideal response that is grounded by the input. \n\nCreating extensive training data from GPT-4 comes with a high cost, and how to automatically control the quality of data generated by a language model remains an open question ([Wang et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560)).\n- Regarding the cost, newly created 150k training data by prompting GPT-4 with detailed instructions can be really expensive (e.g., USD 10k assuming 2k tokens per instance, which can be even longer in practice including detailed instructions) and time-consuming due to API time limits. Our method only requires us to collect medium-scale training data for the Critic model from GPT-4, significantly reducing the costs.   \n- Even if we add detailed instructions to obtain a better response, it is still unclear whether GPT-4 can always generate ideal outputs the following input, as prior work reports even state-of-the-art models can often generate outputs that are not supported by input context ([Liu et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09848); [Gao et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14627))\nAlso, one challenge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation is that retrieved passages are not always relevant or helpful ([Mallen et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10511)), and thus a model needs to have the ability to identify which passages are relevant and how to incorporate relevant passages. This problem may not be fully addressed by generating and training models on ideal GPT-4 outputs. \nWe added more discussions in Section 3.2.1. \n\n\n> Also, GPT-4 might make the decisions on whether to retrieve or not differently from the small LMs as GPT-4 memorizes a lot more world knowledge. Therefore, the annotation given by GPT-4 might not be suitable for small LMs. It would be great to have some discussion or clarification on this.\n\nAs shown in Tables 9 and 10, we ask GPT-4 to judge if retrieving passages enhances generation quality in general or if the continuation requires factual verification, rather than asking if it (GPT-4) can benefit from retrieval, to obtain model-agnostic annotations for the retrieval tokens. We design few-shot demonstrations to make sure modelsâ predictions will follow this intuition. By doing so, we believe that GPT-4 predictions get more model-agnostic. Also, the final reflection tokens for the generator training corpus are predicted by our Crtici model, which is based on Llama2-7b due to the expensive API costs (see the response above). We believe that combining those two models for retrieval token predictions can make the predictions more model-agnostic.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer uRop (1/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We appreciate your strong support. In the following section, we offer our responses to both the questions raised and the identified weaknesses.\n\n### **Passage masking during training**\n> **(Question 1)** In section 3.2.2, the authors mention that during the training time, they mask out the retrieved text chunks. What is the purpose of this masking step?\n\nWithout masking, our model learns to generate passages by itself (as it is considered during loss calculations), rather than learning to use the given retrieved passages at inference time. The main focus of this work is to train an LM to be better at leveraging retrieved passages to be more factual, controllable, and attributable, and the model does not need to memorize and learn to generate evidence passages by themselves.  Empirical findings also indicate that not masking out passages leads to a drop in model performance on certain tasks.\n\n### **Guiding generation using reflection tokens**\n> **(Question 2)** Other than just providing post hoc feedback on how good the current generation is, do the reflection tokens also affect/guide the generation process somehow?\n\n> **(Weaknesses 1)** The reflection tokens might be useful to select more promising generations during the decoding time. But it seems that they do not affect (or guide) the generation process from the beginning and might not help if none of the candidates is good.\n\nReflection tokens help us to identify and choose better segments, similar to rejection-sampling / best-of-n sampling in RL, although we do not rely on external reward models at inference time. While we agree that self-reflective decoding itself does not make models generate a better set of initial samples, it enables us to recognize situations where none of the segments are deemed acceptable. This capability allows practitioners to adjust the inference pipeline for improved generations. For instance, if all passages are deemed irrelevant by Self-RAG, we can sample more passages from other retrieval systems, or if none of the model generations receive high scores/support, we can choose to abstain from answering.\n\nIn our preliminary experiments, we briefly explored the insertion of special tokens at the beginning of the generation, similar to CTRL (Keskar et al., 2019) or Quark (Lu et al., 2022) to guide generation. However, we found that inserting special tokens had limited effectiveness in controlling the quality of generations, such as completeness and factuality. Whether controlled token-based generation could enhance generation quality beyond styles or toxicity is still an open question, and we leave it for future work. Another promising direction to further enhance initial generations is to combine Self-RAG with fine-grained RLHF (Wu et al., 2023) using the Critic as a reward model.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'The authors propose a new framework called self-reflective retrieval augment generation (Self-RAG) to improve upon the vanilla RAG approach that always incorporates a fixed number of retrieved passages.

The data for doing so is created using GPT-4 via specifically designed prompts. The reason being that using GPT-4 everywhere would be very costly and not reproducible.

The release plan is still under discussion, and the authors are waiting for more guidance on this. Meanwhile, we have provided very comprehensive model architecture and training details in the paper (Section 3 and Section 4) and Appendix (C and D) for reproducing LRM. In addition to the final model that we presented in the paper, we also attempted to train a smaller version of LRM. \nThe model uses the same architecture as the baseline model we showed in Appendix C Table 1, and we trained it on 8 NVIDIA (40G) A100 GPUs for 4 days with batch size 64 and gradient accumulation of 4 steps. This model achieves performance between the baseline and the final models shown in Table 1, which is able to produce reasonable results for research purposes. \n\n\n### **5. Comparison to Point-E and Shap-E (Respond to R4Q2)**\nWe thank the reviewer for this very constructive suggestion of an in-depth comparison with Point-E [1] and Shap-E [2]. We mentioned Point-E and Shap-E in our paper, and we will discuss more here. Point-E trains an image-to-3D point cloud diffusion model, and Shap-E encodes point clouds to latent representations and trains a diffusion model on the latents to generate parameters of a 3D implicit function. Both models contain hundreds of millions of learnable parameters and are trained with several million 3D assets (unknown data source and unknown computational cost). \nIn terms of the network and dataset sizes, our LRM has 500 million learnable parameters, and it is trained on 1 million 3D data, which does not show an advantage. In terms of the network architecture, Point-E, Shap-E, and LRM all use transformer-based models and apply cross-attention for inter-modality modeling (i.e., image-to-point cloud, point cloud+image-to-3D latents, and image-to-triplane).\n\nWe hypothesize it is the choice of very compact and expressive triplane representation together with an end-to-end trainable framework that enables the scaling of the LRM and its adequate learning on large datasets (Objaverse and MvImgNet). \nCompared to the unstructured point cloud representation applied in Point-E and Shap-E, LRM applies the structured triplane representation that is aligned with the world frame, which naturally facilitates 2D-to-3D projection. It is also worth mentioning that Point-E uses 4K points (as tokens) and Shap-E uses 16K points (as tokens), but our LRM only uses $3{\\times}32{\\times}32{=}3072$ triplane tokens, which largely reduce the modeling complexity. Additionally, compared to the two-stage approach in Shape-E, which attempts to generate latents that can produce the parameters of implicit 3D functions through a diffusion model, our LRM directly maps 2D images to triplanes, which should be much more stable and efficient to learn.\n\nOverall, we suggest that LRM is a more data-friendly and efficient model than Point-E and Shap-E. We will further extend this discussion and add it to our paper. \n\n[1] Point-E: A System for Generating 3D Point Clouds from Complex Prompts.

As discussed in Section 4.3.2, multiple plausible solutions exist for the occluded side, but our model is deterministic and likely produces averaged modes of the unseen, which could cause blurry textures and shapes.\nThis issue is a joint effect of LRM's deterministic approach and an L2 loss and applying MVImgNet data for training, which mostly only covers 180 degrees of view. A similar issue can be seen in the Masked Autoencoders [1], where the model tends to reconstruct blurry contents when a large block of region is removed from an image. One potential solution is to post-optimize the LRM's output (e.g., using generative prior and SDS loss proposed by DreamFusion [2]) at the cost of extra processing time.\n\nOn the other hand, our ongoing research found that LRM can be easily extended to accept sparse multi-view inputs by passing encoded multi-view image features to the image-to-triplane decoder, and making the positional embeddings query from features of all images via cross-attention to construct the triplane. This model can create very high-fidelity shapes where the issue of blurry occluded portions can be largely eliminated due to the higher coverage of the 3D object. We will make the multiview LRM paper public to the research community.\n\n[1] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners. He et al., 2021.\n\n[2] DreamFusion: Text-to-3D using 2D Diffusion.

We will try to respond. If we missed anything, please elaborate for us. Thank you!\n\nOur model relies on the correct camera parameters in training, and we normalize the cameras in training. We use 3D data in Objaverse (3D models) and MvImgNet (videos of objects) for training; the majority of objects in Objaverse have a certain orientation, but objects in MvImgNet do not. As specified in Section 4.1, to render multiviews from objects in Objaverse, we normalize the 3D shape to the\nbox $[-1,1]^{3}$ in world space and render 32 random views with the same camera pointing toward the world center at arbitrary poses. The camera poses are sampled from a ball of radius $[1.5, 3.0]$ and with height in range $[0.75, 1.60]$.\n\nDuring training, we normalize the camera before feeding an image to LRM (details in Section 4.2), resulting in a very similar formulation as the \\textit{general way} described by the Reviewer. Specifically, regardless of the initial position of the camera, we normalize its poses to position $[0,-2,0]$, with the camera's vertical axis aligned with the upward z-axis in the world frame (analogy to the case of extrinsic=[[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,-2],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]] mentioned by the Reviewer). Such normalization does not alter the input image, so it actually rotates and scales the object accordingly. This means that regardless of where the input image is taken from, it will be projected onto the triplane from exactly the same direction. As discussed in Section 3.2, this method greatly reduces the optimization space of triplane features and facilitates model convergence.\n\nFinally, at inference, LRM assumes the unknown camera parameters to be the normalized cameras that we applied to train the Objaverse data (Section 4.2).\n\n\n### **3. Training Requires Multiview Data (Respond to R4W3)**\n The training of LRM requires multiview data; however, we have witnessed continuous growth in the size and diversity of 3D datasets (e.g., the latest Objaverse-XL dataset contains 10.2 million 3D assets), and there are enormous amounts of videos that can potentially provide multiview supervision for reconstruction. Although the number of single-view images is far larger, we remain positive about the amount of multiview data for large-scale 3D learning in the future. \nOn the other hand, the recent approach 3DGP [2], which is trained on single-view images, still struggles to produce consistent and complete shapes.\nWe believe that incorporating single-view data and limited multiview data is an open and highly valuable research question, which we will leave to future work.\n\n[1] Objaverse-XL: A Universe of 10M+ 3D Objects.

Please see our response to the comments below.\n\n### **1. Fitting vs. Predicting Distribution (Respond to R3Q1)**\nLRM is a deterministic model that learns the distribution of the 3D data in training and fits the given reference image to the learned distribution at inference. Although single-image-to-3D is a one-to-many mapping problem, we made the simplified assumption of one-to-one mapping in this work, which we have shown to be useful in many cases (as visualized in Figure 2, Figure 6, and Figure 7). We would also like to mention that our LRM bridges 2D and 3D representations that can potentially facilitate one-image-to-many-3D-shapes generation in the future. For instance, training latent diffusion models on triplanes predicted by LRM to generate new shapes or reconstruct 3D models from text-to-multiview generations.\n\n\n### **2. Equation (4) (Respond to R3Q2)**\nEquation (4) expresses a self-attention with residual, where the two input terms are identical sequences of tokens. We use the notation of a set to specify that each token in the first term will query all the tokens in the second term. We will revise $j'$ to $j$ for clearness.\n\n\n### **3. Unclear Implementation Details (Respond to R3Q3)**\nLRM's image-to-triplane decoder uses 16 attention heads in all multi-head attention. In the cross-attention layer (details in Section 4.2 and Appendix A.2), only the positional embeddings are applied as Q (queries), and the image features are applied as K and V (keys and values), all being projected to the same dimension $d_{D}=1024$. Then, each of the 32x32x3=3072 positional embedding tokens will query all the 32x32=1024 image feature tokens, resulting in weight shape [32x32x3, 32x32]. Therefore, when multiplied by the Values [32x32, 1024], it produces output tokens of dimension [32x32x3, 1024] that match the input dimension of the next layer.\nWe appreciate the reviewer for pointing this out, and we will add the missing details to our paper. \n\n\n### **4. Volume Rendering (Respond to R3Q4)**\nOur LRM uniformly samples 128 points for each ray in neural rendering.

Paper Contribution (Respond to R1W5)** \nWe agree with the reviewer that our proposed LRM is inspired and based on many previous successes in computer vision, such as image representation learning (DINO), inter-modal modeling (transformer-based cross-attention), 3D representation (triplane-NeRF), and the idea of large-scale training. But we do respectfully disagree on ""the efforts mainly come from the engineering efforts"", as there are enormous alternative design choices, while LRM was built from considerate research insights; our method successfully integrates those components into a scalable and end-to-end trainable system, justifying the plausibility of large-scale 3D training.\nDistinctively, LRM is a feed-forward network that does not rely on any generative prior, and it considers 2D images and 3D shapes as bridgeable modalities and models their correspondence via cross-attention without explicitly defining any spatial alignment. \nLRM is more data-friendly and efficient than recent large-scale 3D models such as Shap-E [1] and Point-E [2], and it is the state-of-the-art single-image-to-3D approach that produces very high-fidelity results. \nWe kindly suggest that the methods and ideas presented in this paper carry huge research value that can impact future 3D deep learning studies.\n\n[1] Point-E: A System for Generating 3D Point Clouds from Complex Prompts.

Computational Cost (Respond to R1W1)**\n\nLike many other recent visual/language models (e.g., CLIP [1], GPT-3 [2], and Stable Diffusion [3]), large-scale training is widely applied to stabilize the optimization processes of large models and achieve the best results at the cost of high computational demand.\nOur best-performing LRM was trained on 128 NVIDIA (40G) A100 GPUs for 3 days, but the inference only requires a single 11G GPU. \n\nIn addition to the final model that we presented in the paper, we also attempted to train a smaller version of LRM. \nThe model uses the same architecture as the baseline model we showed in Appendix C Table 1, and we trained it on 8 NVIDIA (40G) A100 GPUs for 4 days with batch size 64 and gradient accumulation of 4 steps. This model achieves performance between the baseline and the final models shown in Table 1, which is able to produce reasonable results for research purposes. \n\n[1] Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision.

Discriminative vs. Generative Approaches (Respond to R1W3 and R1W4)**\nSimilar to the classic PixelNerf [1] and Pixel2Mesh [2] and many other deterministic approaches, LRM considers a simplified assumption of one-to-one mapping between image and 3D. Intuitively, this line of work focuses on reconstructing the average shape given partial 2D information, just as humans can naturally infer a probable 3D model of an object from just a single view. We believe that the definition of single-image-to-3D task is not necessarily generative but depends on the specific application. \n\nOne important goal of our paper is to justify the plausibility of large-scale training for 3D, which is very under-explored in previous research.\nMoreover, our LRM learns generic 3D prior, and it bridges 2D and 3D representations that can potentially facilitate 3D generation in the future. For instance, training latent diffusion models on triplanes predicted by LRM to generate new shapes or reconstruct \n3D models from text-to-multiview generations.\nWe would like to refer to the comments from Reviewer 4 (eyyQ), ""It fills the gap between 2D and 3D foundation generative model"" and ""The architecture pave the way for other 3D generative models to scale up"".\n\n[1] PixelNeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from One or Few Images.

This highly compressed representation of an image provides much more detailed guidance compared to latent representations of language and this significantly reduces the computational requirements to achieve state-of-the-art results. Our approach also improves the quality of text-conditioned image generation based on our user preference study.The training requirements of our approach consists of 24,602 A100-GPU hours - compared to Stable Diffusion 2.1's 200,000 GPU hours.  Our approach also requires less training data to achieve these results. Furthermore, our compact latent representations allows us to perform inference over twice as fast, slashing the usual costs and carbon footprint of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion model significantly, without compromising the end performance. In a broader comparison against SOTA models our approach is substantially more efficient and compares favourably in terms of image quality.We believe that this work motivates more emphasis on the prioritization of both performance and computational accessibility.",Oral 2C,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gU58d5QeGv,https://openreview.net/forum?id=gU58d5QeGv,gU58d5QeGv,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'Authors proposed Wurstchen, a novel architecture for text-to-image generation that cost-effective while mains high quality output.

We also appreciate the in-depth discussion. Further, we apologize for the few days it took us to respond. Our team is spread across continents and time zones, which unfortunately contributed to the synchronization delay before we could provide this response.\n\nFollowing your comment, we again updated our manuscript and changed Table 2 to differentiate between parameters of the generative model (approx. 1B+1B for WÃ¼rstchen Stage B+StageC) and the total number of parameters (approx. 2.7B). We also added the total number of parameters of SDXL (3.4B).\n\nDue to the double-blind policy, we cannot comment on open-source software you may have used to compute those numbers. However, an older development version of our model trained earlier this year used two different text encoders, due to Stage B and Stage C having overlapping development cycles, which resulted in an outdated version of Stage B being used to train a newer version of Stage C, with the key difference being the text encoders. \n\nHowever, our current model architecture, as presented in the paper, is designed to have only a single text encoder that is shared by both stages. This is also reflected in the parameter count (2.7B parameters vs. 3B.). \n\nNevertheless, we are **very grateful** for your comment, as this discussion sparked an internal debate about the relevance of Stage B text-conditioning, which we suspected to have only a minor impact. To quantify the impact of text-conditioning on Stage B and C we conducted another ablation study, which has been added as Appendix J to the revised supplementary material.\n\nThis additional ablation study compares the image quality of our original model with two variants that only receive text-conditioning in Stage B or C, respectively. These variants are created by simply replacing the text embeddings produced by the text encoder model with zero-tensors of the same shape. The model was not adapted, fine-tuned or retrained in any other way, the entire experiment was inference-only.\n\nWe find that removing the text-conditioning from the trained Stage B has, in our assessment, a negligible impact on the generative quality of the model. Automated metrics register slight changes (a slight decrease of 49.4%/49.6% in PickScore, where 50% would be expected for identical sets, and, in contrast, a slight improvement in FID), which we think can well be attributed to random effects. In contrast, removing text-conditioning from Stage C results in a catastrophic loss of alignment with the text prompt, demonstrating its importance and reinforcing our understanding that Stage B acts as a latent super-resolution module for Stage C.\n\nThis indicates to us that future versions of Stage B do not need to be trained on text-conditioning in Stage B at all and that even in existing versions text-conditioning in Stage B can be dropped without significant changes in generative quality. While this insight is not directly relevant to your question regarding parameters, we found it interesting enough to bring it up anyway, since it highlights potential future improvements to our architecture, further boosting training efficiency. \n\n**Therefore, we, again, would like to thank you for the great diligence and high effort spent for the review.

Stage B samples 4x256x256 latents, which are initialized to random Gaussian noise. The semantic compressor, on the other hand, whose image representation lies at a 16x24x24 space, is not noised during sampling of Stage B. Effectively, the compressed 16x24x24 latents are passed as a conditioning to Stage B to be upsampled to 4x256x256 latents, which are then decoded to 3x1024x1024 by Stage A. This results in an image in pixel space which is 42 times larger that the latent representation of the same image in Stage C.\n\nI believe the primary difference between the authors\' perspectives and mine lies in the interpretation of the inputs and the role of Stage B. In my view, the main input is the 4x256x256 latent code, to which diffusion noise is added and reverse denoising loss is applied, as illustrated in Fig 3. Text and image-embedding vectors serve as conditioning elements that guide this denoising process.\n\n--- \n>Stage B samples 4x256x256 latents, which are initialized to random Gaussian noise.\n\nAs far as I know, itâs a conventional reverse denoising process. The SD UNets also take latent vectors sampled from noise as input: 64x64 latents for v1 and v2-base, 96x96 for v2, and 128x128 for SDXL, all under the guidance of only text embedding.\n\nIn my view, Stage B of WÃ¼rstchen expands this process by incorporating additional image conditioning. Stage B eases the training burden of handling 256x256 latents by utilizing extra image information. In this regard, I believe that a 1024/24=42x compression ratio might be an overstatement, and a more realistic consideration would be a 1024/256=4x compression ratio, as indicated in the caption of Fig 3 (Stage B is trained as a diffusion model inside Stage Aâs latent space, which is a f4-reduction ratio).\n\n--- \n>In Appendix E we provide further empirical evidence for this, by decoding the image directly from Stage Câs 16x24x24 latents using a simple convolutional network without diffusion, which, as we show, directly yields a lower-resolution version of the same image as when decoding the latents with Stage B and Stage A, demonstrating that Stage B indeed only acts as a superresolution upsampler for the encoded image.\n\nThank you for the additional experiments, and I agree that Stage B serves as a latent super-resolution module.\n\nOne point to comment on, though, is that the results of Appendix E are from Stage B after it was **already trained to utilize (*) Stage C embedding**. I think that if Stage B were trained solely with text conditioning, as is the case with SD models, and **without the Stage C conditioning, it would likely be workable too**, as demonstrated by the many successes of SD/LDM models.\n- (*) Iâve reviewed the description stating: ""Since the conditioning on the Semantic Compressor is randomly dropped during Stage B training, we also evaluate Stage B without the image condition of Stage C"". However, this impact largely depends on the dropping ratio. If it is designed to heavily rely on Stage C conditioning, then Stage B is naturally trained to recognize Stage C conditioning.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Post-Rebuttal Review (1/N)'}, 'comment': {'value': ""Dear Authors, thank you for your time and effort in preparing the rebuttal. \n\nI believe the core value of this work does not lie in WÃ¼rstchen outperforming SD models, but rather in its ability to produce satisfactory images with reduced training resources, making it publicly accessible to researchers.

We uploaded a revision based on your feedback.\n\n> [...]  How could the proposed method achieve better inference time than SD-v2.1 in Figure 4? [...]\n\nThe compute to process a sampling step scales quadratically with resolution. Stage C, operates on very low resolution, making sampling steps much more efficient. Stage B, is strongly guided by the latents of Stage C (see Appendix E) and thus needs a much lower number of diffusion steps (12, in our experiments) to produce high-fidelity results.\nHowever, we acknowledge that this should be communicated better. To facilitate an easier understanding of this, we made the following changes to the paper:\n\nFirst, we provide a more detailed plot on the inference-time, splitting up the time spent on the different inference stages in Fig. 4. Second, we overhauled Tab. 2, to show the properties of the individual Stages B and C, instead of only showing Stage C (more on this later).\n\n>I think the Baseline LDM [...]  needs to be trained for GPU hours of Stage B + Stage C [...]\n\nWe also discussed this internally before submission, as both models are diffusion models. We eventually decided to train our baseline with Stage Câs budget, as Stage C is the image generator (see Appendix E)\nTraining a second baseline is not possible for us, as the 36K GPU-hours is outside our available budget and would require approx. 3 weeks to complete, not including evaluation.\nAs a compromise, we are in the process of fine-tuning Baseline LDM for 11K  additional gpu-hours to match the compute of Stage B+C training. We plan to add this model as a second baseline to the camera-ready version, as the results will unfortunately not be ready in the discussion period.\n\n> The parameter values in Tab. 2 might confuse readers due to inconsistencies in their presentation [...]\n\nThank you for pointing this out. Based on your feedback, we added CLIP-Score as well as separating total and generative parameters. We list Stage B and C as requested.\n\n> I think the description [...] in page 5 looks incorrect or overclaimed, [...]\n\nWe think the core of this misunderstanding lies in the question of how Stage B and C interact. Intuitively, Stage C conditioning Stage B suggests that Stage B is generating the image while Stage C is merely guiding this process, or both stages forming a complex generative cascade. However, Stage B should be viewed as a latent super resolution model (employing denoising for the decoding process), not as a generative model. Stage B samples 4x256x256 latents, which  are initialized to random Gaussian noise. The semantic compressor, on the other hand, whose image representation lies at a 16x24x24 space, is not noised during sampling of Stage B. Effectively, the compressed 16x24x24 latents are passed as a conditioning to Stage B to be upsampled to 4x256x256 latents, which are then decoded to 3x1024x1024 by Stage A. This results in an image in pixel space which is 42 times larger that the latent representation of the same image in Stage C. In Appendix E we provide further empirical evidence for this, by decoding the image directly from Stage Câs 16x24x24 latents using a simple convolutional network without diffusion, which, as we show, directly yields a lower-resolution version of the same image as when decoding the latents with Stage B and Stage A, demonstrating that Stage B indeed only acts as a superresolution upsampler for the encoded image.\n\n> [...] Why did the authors change the resolution for IS in Tab. 2? [...]  I also highly recommend including CLIP score.\n\nConcerning the CLIP-Score, we agree that this is a missing piece in our automated evaluation, we added it to Tab. 2 and more results can be found in Appendix B of the revised manuscript. We found only minor changes in CLIP score, especially between the SD models and WÃ¼rstchen.\nConcerning IS-Score, the generated images used to compute the IS are the same images used to compute the FID-score. We think this is a misunderstanding, as a matter of fact, we used the code of CogView in particular for computing IS to make reproducibility more straightforward: https://tinyurl.com/f8mn9f2a \nWe write 299x299 since In line 36 of the linked, public source-file, images are resized to 299x299 pixels, hence ensuring all images are evaluated at the same resolution (which is, in fact, the fixed-size input resolution of the used InceptionV3 model). Because of this implementation quirk, we decided to report the âtrueâ input resolution of the Inception model in the paper, to enhance clarity and reproducibility. \n\n> The behavior of the proposed model seems less explored. [...]\n\nWe agree that a more in-depth analysis of hyperparameters is valuable. We hence addressed this in two ways: We added Appendix I containing FID-CLIP plots for classifier-free-guidance and sampling steps. We also added Appendix H, which is a more detailed analysis on the generative qualities of WÃ¼rstchen based on the results of Sec. 4.2.'}}, {'comment': {'value': '> *""The approach is only tested on latent diffusion models. While there is no reason to believe it wouldn\'t work on pixel diffusion models it would be nice to verify this.""*\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that this would be interesting. Indeed, we have attempted a pixel-wise Stage B during early development. In these early trials, we found training to be slower to converge, and less efficient, which is why we ultimately decided to move on to latent diffusion models. However, a very recent publication has done something very similar with pixel diffusion models independently of us with their Matryoshka Diffusion Models (MDM) [1]. While MDM  models have a slightly different architecture, the core idea is very similar to our approach and their results as well as ours indicate that WÃ¼rstchen could be used in pixel-space.

For the same reason, we did not experiment with the Stage C architecture.\nWe hope to explore these avenues in future works.'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""We are very glad about this very positive assessment of our work.

Yet, as we enforce a normalized latent space (mean of 0, standard deviation of 1) of Stage C analyzing the distributions of the latent representation directly will not yield meaningful results. \nHowever, we expanded our analysis on the generative qualities further by analyzing categories and difficulty groups of partiprompts individually (Appendix H), to provide a more nuanced picture of the generative qualities of our model.\nIn a similar vein, we added FID-CLIP-score plots to characterize the model's behavior at different classifier-free-guidance scales and number of sampling steps (Appendix I). We also added collages for randomly sampled images for both ablation studies.\n\n\n\n\nWe also noted that this reviewer has flagged us for an ethics review due to the use of LAION-5B, and, since we spend significant effort into mitigating ethical risks that might have been introduced by the use of this dataset, we would like to take the chance to briefly comment on the measures we introduced in our training process to address potentially harmful impacts. We have also detailed these steps in the revised manuscript in Appendix G.\nThe version of LAION-5B available to the authors was aggressively de-duplicated and pre-filtered for harmful, NSFW and watermarked content using binary image-classifiers (watermark filtering), clip models (NSFW, aesthetic properties) and black-lists for URLs and words, reducing the raw dataset down to 699M images (12.06 % of the original dataset). \nHowever, since we found out that there was still a non-negligible image portion that contained images that fall within the NSFW category, during training, we applied an even more aggressive filter threshold on the NSFW and aesthetic properties, and also dropped all images of low resolution (smaller than 512x512 px).\nThe combination of these filters further reduced the number of unique image-text pairs to 103 million, which is approx. 1.78% of LAION-5B.\nWe acknowledge that this filtering is based on automated algorithms and due to the size of the dataset, we cannot guarantee the absence of false negatives. However, we think it is important to mention that we are aware of ethical concerns surrounding the LAION-5B dataset, and we tried to mitigate them as much as possible. \n\n\nFinally, we also want to mention that we think our increase in data efficiency (our model was trained on only 103M unique image-text-pairs) is an important step to making text-to-image model training more ethical, as the curation of datasets becomes significantly easier at smaller scales.\nVery recent publications like CommonCanvas [1] demonstrate that data at this scale is not far away from reaching a size that can be curated to a much higher standard.\n\n[1] CommonCanvas: An Open Diffusion Model Trained with Creative-Commons Images\nAaron Gokaslan, A.

This reduction is particularly valuable during the memory-bound inference step, where efficiency is paramount.

Shouldnât all weights be pre-loaded to the GPU HBM in common inference frameworks like vLLM [3]?  \n\nWe apologize for the confusion. The reviewer is indeed correct in their assumption that weights are pre-loaded into GPU memory. However, our research highlights an additional I/O cost incurred during the token generation phase. This cost arises from transferring weights between GPU memory and computational caches and registers.\nOur findings on aggregated sparsity, as shown in Figure 7, reveal that this cost can be significantly reduced through neuron reuse. By reusing neurons, the total weight transfer volume during multiple token generations is substantially lower compared to scenarios without reuse.  \nFurthermore, our findings have implications beyond this initial scenario. In cases where the entire model cannot fit in the GPU memory, but only a smaller subset can (i.e., by sharding or offloading), aggregated sparsity can be beneficial. For example, we can utilize a portion of the down projection layer's loaded weights for several subsequent generation steps without a significant loss in the quality of generation, as detailed in Figure 7(c).  \nWe have updated our manuscript for clearer articulation of these points. We believe these findings open up intriguing optimization opportunities for exploration.\n\n---  \n> Although the paper claims that replacing other activations with ReLU only has negligible impacts on the performance, the accuracy drop seems not to be so marginal. However, I agree that this replacement can also be a potential good trade-off between model performance and model efficiency.\n\nWe agree with your assessment of the favorable trade-off between model performance and efficiency. The performance gap with ReLU activation is relatively minor and can be offset by slightly prolonged training. Considering the widespread application of current LLMs, this additional training and fine-tuning is a justified investment for the efficiency gains achieved, as illustrated in Appendix B. These gains are particularly valuable in practical scenarios, highlighting the relevance of our approach in real-world deployments.\n\n--- \nIn conclusion, we hope we have incorporated all reviewer's feedback into the revised manuscript.

Please see our detailed response below:\n\n> The observation that replacing activation functions like GeLU, SiLU with ReLU only marginally influences performance is not new. It is also mentioned and discussed in [1][2].\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's observation regarding the impact of replacing activation functions like GeLU and SiLU with ReLU. While the marginal influence of such replacements on performance has indeed been noted in previous works, our study diverges in both scope and focus:\n\n* **Scale and Scope of Study**: Our research extends beyond the replacement of activation functions in existing models, conducting a comprehensive investigation across various activation functions, models, and evaluation tasks. This significantly larger scale study is particularly noteworthy, as previous works (e.g., [1], [2]) have primarily focused on smaller-scale experiments, such as replacing GELU with ReLU in ViT or BERT. In contrast, we train 1 billion parameter models on over 200 billion tokens, thus providing a more robust and extensive evaluation on various activation functions, architectures and tasks.\n* **Inference Efficiency of LLMs**: The central motivation of our work is to analyze the implications of different activation functions on the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Our findings demonstrate that commonly used activation functions do not offer a favorable balance between performance gains and efficiency or latency losses during inference. We argue in the paper that with additional one-time cost of longer training on relufied model one can get speed up during inference.\n* **Exploration of Activation Function Consequences**: Our work delves into understanding the broader consequences of using different activation functions in LLMs. For instance, we investigate the pre-activation distribution, as shown in Figure 5, which leads us to explore a rarely used activation function for LLMs: the shifted ReLU. This exploration reveals that shifted ReLU can significantly increase sparsity while maintaining competitive performance, a finding detailed in Section 5.3 and Appendix F.\n* **Practicality in Pretrained LLMs**: We emphasize the practicality of modifying activation functions in already pretrained LLMs. Our study illustrates that fine-tuning these models with ReLU does not result in a significant drop in accuracy, highlighting a trade-off that has been underexplored in prior research.  \n\n\nIn summary, while acknowledging the contributions of previous works, our study offers a unique perspective by examining the consequences of activation function selection in LLMs from an âinference efficiencyâ standpoint. We believe that our comprehensive approach and the novel insights generated, particularly in the context of model efficiency and practical adaptability, represent a significant advancement in the field.\n\n----\n\n> The evaluation (Table 1 & 2) majorly focuses on zero-shot learning and ICL scenarios. Although I understand that zero-shot learning and ICL are common settings to compare LLM performance, it can be helpful to compare the model performance on generation tasks to better understand how different activations influence model performance. \n\nThank you for your valuable comment. In Appendix F.2, we have included new results that compare the generation quality of several relufied models. Overall, similar to the zero-shot scenario, the relufication process does not significantly impact perplexity. More interestingly, the TruthfulQA scores of the models seem to improve in the majority of cases, which encourages us to further investigate the impact of relufication on generation quality for other scenarios and additional models. In addition, we have included additional perplexity scores throughout Appendix F (e.g., Tab.4, Fig.14b) that are in line with our conclusions on zero-shot tasks.  \n\nWe thank the reviewer again and hope that these enhancements to our empirical evaluations, inspired by your suggestion, will strengthen the paper.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer nzdz'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We sincerely thank the reviewer for their insightful comments.

In Appendix F.3, we have compared relufied models with several pruning methods.

Furthermore, for hardware compatibility, we utilized the 2:4 pruning method.   \n\nOur results show that the weight pruning methods exhibit significantly lower zero-shot accuracy across several tasks. We partially attribute this to the inherent differences between activation sparsity and weight pruning, with the latter permanently removing parts of the model and consequently reducing its overall computational capacity and knowledge.   \n\nThis additional result, we believe, has significantly enhanced the comprehensiveness of our study, and we thank the reviewer for their valuable suggestion.\n\n----\n\n> - The sparsification mechanism relies on the underlying architecture supporting the sparse BLAS operations which is not the case for some applications.

What are the latency speedups of this approach on the hardware it was tested on?  What are prerequisites to make sure a user can realize the full benefits from this approach?

While we are continuing to improve our implementation, details of our efficient kernel for developers familiar with GPU programming, are provided in Appendix B.1.

We are glad to hear the reviewer found the quality and clarity of our work solid. Below, we address the comments and questions by the reviewer:\n> The authors argue that pretraining with other activation only gives at best marginal performance, and longer training could compensate for the gap. However, I believe this argument can be better supported. The bottom row of Figure 2 only considers three downstream datasets ( maybe perplexity would be more indicative here), and it seems like the accuracy is still growing. It is hard to judge whether longer training could compensate, and if yes, how much more training we need.\n\nThanks to this comment, we have added two results in Appendix F.1 strengthening our claim. First, we have expanded our analysis to include results for up to 200 billion training tokens (an increase of 100 billion) in Fig. 14.a. Second, Fig. 14.b illustrates that the performance is not significantly impacted by the choice of activation function, even when considering perplexity on LAMBADA dataset. Our findings align with scaling laws, suggesting that longer training is indeed capable of compensating for any marginal performance gaps. We hope these added results offer a convincing argument.  \nShould the reviewer have suggestions for further experiments to improve our work, we are open to incorporating them.\n\n-------\n\n\n> Could the authors elaborate on how they would imagine optimizing the finetuning process in relufication further to recover the full performance? \n\nThis is an interesting question. There are several directions to further optimize the finetuning process:\n\n* Increasing the number of tokens used for finetuning could further minimize the performance gap: This extension would allow the model more time to adapt to the new activation function while retaining the learned knowledge. To make this more practical, we can explore efficient finetuning methods such as low-rank methods (e.g., LoRA).\n* More tailored training regimes: Currently, we follow the pretraining recipe of our base models. However, we believe that for short finetuning periods, we can use larger learning rates.\n* Exploring the impact of finetuning data distribution: One interesting hypothesis is that finetuning on data with a similar distribution to the training data can help stabilize the training, reduce the impact of catastrophic forgetting, and help the model recover performance faster at larger learning rates.\n* Another option may be to relufy layer by layer instead of doing it for all layer at once. This will lead to smaller changes which give the network easier time to adapt and recover. \n\nWe hope this answers the reviewer's question. We are eager to know the reviewer's thoughts on these future directions\n\n-------\n> We observe different aggregated sparsity ratios at different layers: the deep layer seems less sparse, according to Figure 7(a). Then, for the perplexity experiment with aggregated sparsity, did the authors use the same Î³ for all layers? If not, could this help recover more performance?  \n\nIn our initial approach, we used a fixed gamma across all layers. However, based on your suggestion, we experimented with a mixed reuse strategy in Fig. 15 Appendix F.4. This strategy employs varying gamma values for different layers, with promising initial results. As gamma increases, we observe that shorter reuse periods in later layers do not entirely compensate the extended reuse duration in earlier layers.

We observe that this representation is naturally suited for set-level transformers and develop a regression-based approach that maps image patches to corresponding rays.

However, as the reviewer still indicated they may lean towards rejection, we wish to state our case again before the discussion period ends. Based on the reviewer comments above, the primary concern that now affects their rating is that they believe it is critical to show empirical results on datasets like MegaDepth. While we appreciate the comments that we (and the field) should examine these setups, we feel that setting this new evaluation setup as a barrier for acceptance is an unreasonable (and counterproductive) bar for an emerging research area.\n\nSpecifically, learning-based methods for pose prediction with sparse-view/wide-baseline input represent a growing body of work, where prior methods (e.g. RelPose [ECCV 22], SparsePose [CVPR 23], PoseDiffusion [ICCV 23], RelPose++ [3DV 24]) have evaluated object-centric pose estimation in datasets like CO3D. In this commonly adopted setup, which is of practical significance in applications like reconstruction in online marketplaces, our approach clearly outperforms all these baselines. Moreover, following PoseDiffusion, we also demonstrate generalization to a scene-centric dataset RealEstate10k, where our approach again improves over prior work. Given these empirical results in the standard evaluation setup adopted by prior work, combined with the technical contributions (that the reviewer agrees on), we believe that our work clearly represents a step forward for this area of learning-based pose prediction and that the community would benefit from it.\n\nAgain, we understand the reviewer may wish to see methods such as ours being evaluated in other scenarios that are commonly studied in the SfM community. But such change occurs gradually, and should not be enforced overnight! For example, PoseDiffusion proposed a scene-centric generalization, and our work now incorporates the preliminary results on MegaDepth (which will hopefully encourage others to follow suit). We would therefore urge the reviewer to reconsider, and respectfully, not enforce a threshold that deviates from common practice in prior works as a criterion against acceptance of our work.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We would like to thank the reviewer for their response.\n\nFirst, we would like to make a minor clarification â our approach does outperform the naive baseline on RealEstate10k, reducing the fractions of errors by a third (error rate from ~16% to ~11%).\n\nRegarding MegaDepth, we note that this dataset comprises of large-scale scenes, and sampling a few random images per scene can lead to uncorrelated viewpoints (e.g. images from different city blocks with no visual overlap!). We believe that this setup (i.e. naive random sampling of a few images for a large scene) is not a practically relevant one, and one may need more careful consideration to define a useful empirical protocol for evaluation (e.g. consider sets of views with overlapping visual frustums, or limit view sampling within a spatial grid, etc.). For the purpose of demonstration, we simply trained by naive sampling and demonstrated results on selected sequences where the images did have visual overlap, but this is not an experimental protocol we wish to recommend to the community (and possibly set a bad precedent). In fact, the issues with RealEstate10K (a benchmark proposed in previous published work) highlight the challenge of developing a healthy scene-centric benchmark.\n\nFinally, regarding possible heuristics (e.g. image retrieval and coarse matching), these are more relevant when given a very large number of images e.g. given 100s of images of the Colosseum, one can retrieve similar ones. In our setup with only a few images (<=8), these are not easily applicable.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Thanks for the clarifications'}, 'comment': {'value': ""I thank authors for putting efforts in a nice rebuttal. \n\nRegarding scaled poses, I guess I misunderstood what you meant.

I see that SP+SG is more accurate when converges. When it doesn't converge, there are many heuristics one can apply, such as image retrieval and then coarse matching, is Ray Diffusion more accurate than such heuristics?\n\nThanks for ablation on memory requirements, runtimes, accuracy at different threshold. \n\nOverall, I am inclined to put this in acceptance threshold. My only concern is that there should have been numerical comparison for this method on scene centric dataset (not RealEstate10k because of bias), and it should really be part of the main paper (not the appendix).

We believe both concerns raised by the reviewer may stem from possible misunderstandings, and we attempt to clarify those below.\n\n- - - \n\n## Clarification on Setup\n\nThe reviewer stated that *""the presented method predicts the camera pose from the single-view image""*. This would suggest that our method is taking in one image at a time and predicting the corresponding ray bundle: $ \\mathcal{R}_i = f(I_i)$.\n\nRather, we wish to clarify that our method predicts the rays from all images $\\\\{I_1, \\ldots, I_N\\\\}$ **jointly** (See Eqs 7 and 11):\n$$ \\\\{\\mathcal{R}_1, \\ldots, \\mathcal{R}_N\\\\} = f(\\\\{I_1, \\ldots, I_n\\\\}).$$\n\nWe do predict one ray per patch, but to reiterate, we predict these in the context of all patches across all images. Thus, the network has the capacity to reason about correspondences implicitly. \n\n## Direct Prediction vs Cameras from Pairwise Correspondences\n\nWe believe that the reviewerâs concerns are regarding comparing two philosophically different approaches for camera prediction â âdirectâ vs âcorrespondence basedâ, and why one may be better than the other.\n\nBy a âdirectâ approach, we imply a system that, like ours, predicts a set of cameras given a set of images without constructing pairwise correspondences:\n $$ f(I_1, \\ldots, I_n) = \\\\{\\Pi_1, \\ldots,\\Pi_N\\\\}.$$\n\nIn contrast, correspondence-based methods (e.g. COLMAP) would infer pairwise correspondences and then recover cameras.\n$$ f(I_i, I_j) = C_{i\\rightarrow j}, \\\\{C_{i \\rightarrow j} \\\\} \\Rightarrow \\\\{\\Pi_1, \\ldots,\\Pi_N\\\\} $$\n\nWe would like to emphasize that ours is not the first work to highlight that learning direct prediction can perform better than correspondence-based methods. In particular, SparsePose and PoseDiffusion both show that their methods (where cameras are defined in a first-image-aligned frame similar to ours) outperform COLMAP. Our approach further improves over these via a different camera parameterization.\n\nWhile we agree that this patchwise ray prediction is a challenging task, unlike the two-stage correspondence approach, it does not require explicit pairwise matching, which is difficult under wide baseline images or textureless objects. Moreover, the correspondence-based methods require a second stage to infer cameras and this can itself be a challenging task. \n\nFinally, we would also like to reiterate that in the context of prior prediction methods which outperform correspond-based baselines, our work simply improves the camera representation predicted. The fact that correspondence-based methods perform worse in comparison is an already established fact in these prior methods, and respectfully, should not be an argument against our work in particular.\n\n\n## Clarification on Additional Results\n\nWe believe there may be a misunderstanding regarding the new experiments added in our top-level comment. These are **not** updated results on Co3D (which are updated in the pdf in Tables 1 and 2). Instead, the table in our comment corresponds to zero-shot generalization to a scene-level dataset RealEstate10k, which is an experiment used by PoseDiffusion to test such generalization. In the context of this clarification, we address the comments from the reviewer below: \n\n> As updated by the authors, ray diffusion works worse than ray regression in camera rotation estimation\n\nThis is **not** true in general. In our main results in CO3D, RayDiffusion always outperforms RayRegression (accuracy of 88.1% compared to 81.9% for rotation, N=8 for unseen categories). In RealEstate10k, the two perform almost similarly (with Regression marginally better), and we conjecture this is because there is less uncertainty in the data (no symmetry, smaller motions on average).\n\n > More importantly, the authors have found that there is a strong bias in the CO3D dataset and even predicting a constant rotation works better than RelPose++. This makes the conducted experiments less convincing.\n\nThe bias we identified is in RealEstate10k data, and we only wanted to clarify that this generalization experiment recommended by PoseDiffusion should be taken with a small grain of salt. There is **no** such forward-facing bias in CO3D, which consists of turntable-style object captures, and the conclusions from our main results still stand. \n\n> Given that the presented method predicts directions in the canonical frame, there is a potential risk of it being overfitted to this observed bias.\n\nOur approach performs better compared to the baselines on this scene-level dataset with different camera distributions than the training dataset CO3D. This in fact shows that it is more robust to such observation biases!\n\n- - - -\n\nWe again wish to thank the reviewer for this opportunity to engage, and would really appreciate if they could indicate whether the above responses helped clarify any misunderstandings.

Some of my concerns have been addressed, but my major concern still exists. The advantages compared to correspondence-based methods are still unclear to me. The authors argued that these methods need pairwise images as input while the presented method predicts the camera pose from the single-view image. However, to estimate the camera pose, the most straightforward idea is to somehow predict the pose from a single image. Since such a single-view prediction doesn't work well, pairwise images are utilized to make the problem easier. In the presented method, the predicted $\\mathbf{d}$ represents a direction in the canonical coordinate system, which means the network has to learn the camera rotation from the current view to the canonical view. Moreover, as I mentioned before, the authors propose to learn the direction for each image patch. Intuitively, such a dense prediction from a single view is more challenging. I don't understand why the method achieves promising results while the correspondence-based approach fails.\n\nAs updated by the authors, ray diffusion works worse than ray regression in camera rotation estimation, which weakens the claimed contribution. More importantly, the authors have found that there is a strong bias in the CO3D dataset and even predicting a constant rotation works better than RelPose++.

As we report in Table 6, the inference speed of our Ray Diffusion method is 2.6X faster than RelPose while our Ray Regression method (which requires a single forward pass) is 220X faster.\n\n> the explanation of Eq.5 is a bit confusing. What is the âidentityâ camera? Are there any constraints on this equation? Does it still hold when the image depicts multiple planes?\n\nBy identity camera, we refer to a camera for which both the intrinsics and rotation are identity matrices: $K=I, R=I$. We have now clarified this in the text.\n\nIf we have a camera with rotation $R$ and intrinsics $K$, the direction of the ray corresponding to a (homogenous) pixel coordinate $u_i \\in \\mathbf{P}^2$ can be computed as $R^T K^{-1} u_i$. Given predicted directions $d_i$, we thus need to compute optimal $R, K$ such that $R^T K^{-1} u_i = d_i$,  or equivalently, $(K R) d_i = P d_i = u_i$. Note that this is an âequalityâ in homogenous representations (up-to-scale). Solving this corresponds to finding the optimal homography matrix such that $ H d_i = u_i$.\n\nOur terminology stems from an alternate interpretation where âdirectionsâ can be thought of as points on the plane at infinity (in projective 3D space) i.e. a direction $d_i  \\in \\mathbf{P}^2$ implies a point $(d_i,0) \\in \\mathbf{P}^3$. In this interpretation, finding $K,R$ is equivalent to finding the homography that relates  the images of this plane at infinity under the two cameras: identity camera $(K=I, R=I)$ and the regular camera $(K=K, R=R)$ (see Sec 8.5 in Hartley & Zisserman). \n\nPlease note that this does not have anything to do with planar surfaces present in the scene; and eq 5 holds for any scene geometry.\n\n\n> As shown in Table 1, sometimes, the performance of the presented method decreases when more images are involved.\n\nThis issue appears to be due to a bug when computing our camera intrinsics at training time (see top-level comment).

The performance of Ray Regression (Ours) surpasses that of R+T Regression by a considerable margin. The diffusion model only results in a 3.8% improvement in the case of two images. To my understanding, the superior performance is primarily attributed to the least-squares optimization which accounts for a robust estimation. However, it is still quite confusing why the pose estimation benefits from the ray representation.\n\nWe agree with the reviewerâs assessment that over-parameterization plays a crucial role, but the other important source of improvement is the tight coupling between the ray estimation and local features. We respectfully disagree with the reviewerâs statement that performance is âprimarily attributed to the least-squares optimization which accounts for a robust estimation.â To verify this, we conduct an experiment that still makes use of our patch-predicted rays but reduces the ârobustnessâ of the least squares optimization. Specifically, we use a randomly sampled subset of the 256 predicted rays per camera to recover the camera extrinsics. We compute the rotation accuracy for our Ray Regression model on unseen object categories for N=8 images:\n\n\n| # of Rays                        | 6    | 16   | 26   | 56   | 106    | 256  |\n|----------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Ray Regression Rotation Accuracy | 73.8 | 81.2 | 81.2 | 81.4 | 81.8 | 81.8 |\n| Ray Regression Camera Center Accuracy | 60.7 | 61.8 |  61.9 |  61.4 | 61.8 | 61.6 |\n\nAs we can see, accuracy goes up very quickly, even with rather few rays. Of course, the least-squares optimization gives robustness (e.g. comparing 6 rays vs 16 rays), but we believe the primary gain is from the accurately estimated rays by the local-level joint reasoning of our network.\n\n> Basically, the idea is to regress a ray represented as a 6D vector for each patch in the RGB image. It is arguably more challenging than predicting R and T. The difficulty lies in two aspects. First, it is a dense prediction problem. Second, it regresses 3D information from RGB images. One could also predict the corresponding 2D coordinates in the right image for each patch in the left image as an alternative. Intuitively, it is easier to predict 2D coordinates than 6D ray vectors. The authors argue that such a method could struggle in sparse view settings due to insufficient image overlap to find correspondences. It is unclear why the presented method is able to achieve better robustness.\n\nWe agree that predicting dense 2D correspondences between image pairs is an interesting alternative. However, converting such 2D correspondences to 3D cameras (in the presence of uncertainty, partial visibility, etc) is still challenging. Moreover, this is fundamentally a pairwise prediction task and is hard to extend to multiple images where the question of which images should be matched is also uncertain. Because our solution is not restricted to such pairwise reasoning, it bypasses this issue altogether. In addition, the representation inferred is directly convertible to global cameras.\n\nWe also note that our COLMAP baseline essentially does the sparser version of such a 2D correspondence-to-camera pipeline using a state-of-the-art feature matcher. Such methods lack robustness because of insufficient 2D correspondences.\n\n> Moreover, it is confusing why the presented method can recover the translation. According to Eq.3, m is coupled with the translation t. Predicting m then demands a requirement of capturing information about the camera translation. However, the actual input of the network is a cropped image. The information regarding t loses after the cropping.\n\nThank you for pointing this out. We do provide the bounding box information of the crop to the network which is important for reasoning about translation (as the reviewer notes). Specifically, we concatenate the pixel coordinate of each patch (in normalized device coordinates with respect to the uncropped image) to the spatial features for both the ray regression and ray diffusion models that we train. \n\nWe apologize for missing this detail in the earlier version and have now clarified this in the text and added the pixel coordinates to Eqs 7 and 11.'}}, {'comment': {'value': '>The authors announce that the traditional representation of pose maybe suboptimal in neural learning in the part of introduction. However, no further discussion is given. More specific explanation is necessary, and the comparison with the proposed novel representation of pose is also required.\n\nWe apologize if this was unclear, but by âtraditional representation of poseâ in neural learning, we meant global parameterizations of 6D pose in the form of rotation and translation. Our experiments do highlight the benefits of our approach which represents cameras as rays compared to representative approaches which represent cameras using the âtraditional representation.â In particular, in Table 1, we demonstrate that our representation improves rotation accuracy by 58% for regression-based approaches (Ray Regression vs R+T Regression) and 22% for diffusion-based approaches (Ray Diffusion vs PoseDiffusion w/o GGS). The improvement of our representation over comparable methods that use the traditional global representation of cameras holds for camera center accuracies and all numbers of images.\n\nWe hypothesize that this improvement is due to the following factors:\n1. Predicting bundles of rays is particularly well-suited to transformer-based set-to-set inference.\n2. Local features enable reasoning about low-level features like correspondences that are not possible in existing global-feature parameterizations in prior work.\n\n> The authors fail to state more details of the proposed network architecture. Moreover the training detail is also required. \n\nWe use standard network architectures: DINOv2 for feature extraction and DiT for regressing and diffusing camera rays.

We would be happy to clarify any other details, and we will be releasing code to ensure reproducibility.\n\n> To demonstrate the performance of the proposed novel representation, can authors undertake more experiments on more datasets?\n\nWe have added experiments on zero-shot generalization to RealEstate10K (following PoseDiffusion) as well as newly trained results on MegaDepth (see top-level comment).

We agree that âsparse-viewâ may not be the optimal term. However, even the term âwide-baselineâ may not apply in all scenarios, e.g. 2 cameras that are spatially close but viewing different directions. Perhaps a more technically accurate term would be âsparsely sampled views,â e.g., if we think of a lightfield $L(x,y,u,v)$, sparse vs densely sampled views differ in the density of the sampling of $L$. We would be happy to emphasize this in the text, but if the reviewer does not have any objections, we would prefer to stick with the current title to follow convention in prior work (e.g. sparse-view reconstruction).\n\n> Also, I found the camera visualization in Figure 5-9 to be confusing. Without the context of the 3D object or the coordinate system and with only a few cameras, it\'s hard to interpret what I\'m looking at. In many cases it\'s not even clear which cameras belong to which algorithm\'s results.\n\nWe have re-made all the qualitative results figures starting from Figure 5. We respectfully ask the reviewer for feedback on the new presentation of results.\n\n> I\'m curious whether the authors think that this method would be effective in more realistic multi-view imaging environments where the imagery is not tightly cropped to just one object and where the camera motion could be more general? \n\nOur method can generalize to such setups. Even though our method was trained with tight crops on object-centric CO3D, we find that it generalizes zero-shot to RealEstate10K even though we used center crops (following PoseDiffusion) and the dataset has different camera trajectories. Similarly, our MegaDepth experiments use center cropping and the dataset has dramatically different camera motion.\n\n> Have any experiments been run to see if this method works on images ""in the wild""?\n\nWe include results on self-captured data in Figure 6.

We have added a GPU memory analysis for our Ray Diffusion model to the paper in Table 7. According to `nvidia-smi`, backward diffusion using our ray diffusion model on 8 images reaches a peak GPU memory usage of 3095 MiB of VRAM, which should fit on any standard GPU.\n\n> It would also be nice to see accuracy at different thresholds i.e. @5, @10, @15.\n\nIn Tables 10 and 11, we analyze the rotation and camera center accuracies at a variety of thresholds.

Most of the applications require properly ""scaled"" poses.\n\nWe would like the reviewer to clarify what is meant by not scaling poses. We are interpreting the reviewerâs question as whether itâs possible to not normalize camera scale at training time and instead learn metric scale. In our camera normalization procedure, the sampled minibatches of cameras are re-scaled such that the first camera always has a unit translation. This procedure is done because the ground truth camera poses are acquired using COLMAP which can produce scenes in an arbitrary scene scale, which is not consistent between sequences. Thus, it is not possible to learn metric scale since the magnitude of translations would be ill-defined. If we have incorrectly interpreted the reviewerâs statement, we politely request clarification.\n\n> The language is clear but I think the paper presentation is poor. Here are a few suggestions to improve the readability of the paper.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the feedback and have made revisions accordingly.\nWe have re-made all the qualitative results figures (Figure 5 onward). We respectfully ask the reviewer for feedback on the new presentation of results.\nFor Figure 2 specifically, we are trying to convey 1) that the camera and ray representation are easily interchangeable and 2) that even noisy rays (e.g. if they do not intersect at a single point) can still be converted into a valid camera. We would appreciate any feedback from the reviewer on how to make this more clear. We have updated the caption to add more context.\n\n> I see runtime in the appendix, but how does this method scale with adding a number of views? Instead of 8 what if I had 32? What are the memory requirements and inference runtime graphs?\n\nAlthough our model is trained with 8 images, we find that it can generalize effectively to more images by re-sampling mini-batches during the backward diffusion process. Specifically, at each iteration of DDPM, we can sample batches of 8 images (keeping the first image fixed), and predict the $X_0$s for each batch separately. With more images, the memory cost is constant but the runtime scales linearly. We find that our performance remains consistent with more images despite training with only 8 images, as we report below and added to Table 5 in the paper\n\n| # of Images                           | 8    | 15   | 22   | 29   | 36   | 43   |\n|----------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Rotation Acc.

The performance of Ray Regression (Ours) surpasses that of R+T Regression by a considerable margin. The diffusion model only results in a 3.8% improvement in the case of two images. To my understanding, the superior performance is primarily attributed to the least-squares optimization which accounts for a robust estimation. However, it is still quite confusing why the pose estimation benefits from the ray representation. \n\nBasically, the idea is to regress a ray represented as a 6D vector for each patch in the RGB image. It is arguably more challenging than predicting R and T. The difficulty lies in two aspects. First, it is a dense prediction problem. Second, it regresses 3D information from RGB images. One could also predict the corresponding 2D coordinates in the right image for each patch in the left image as an alternative. Intuitively, it is easier to predict 2D coordinates than 6D ray vectors. The authors argue that such a method could struggle in sparse view settings due to insufficient image overlap to find correspondences. It is unclear why the presented method is able to achieve better robustness. \n\nMoreover, it is confusing why the presented method can recover the translation. According to Eq.3, m is coupled with the translation t. Predicting m then demands a requirement of capturing information about the camera translation. However, the actual input of the network is a cropped image. The information regarding t loses after the cropping.\n\nThe authors only conducted experiments on the Co3D dataset, which makes the evaluation not convincing enough. There are several datasets that have been widely used in the literature such as Megadepth, ScanNet, and HPatches. It would be beneficial if the authors could show the effectiveness of the over parameterization on such datasets.\n\nAccording to Eq.7, the patches of all available images are jointly processed, which is computationally expensive. As reported by the authors, training the diffusion model takes four days on 8 A6000 GPUs, which is much slower than RelPose and RelPose++.'}, 'questions': {'value': 'â¢\tMost of the equations in this paper make sense to me, but the explanation of Eq.5 is a bit confusing.

We point these out below for convenience.\n- Lemma 14 is composed of two terms. The first term is a positive constant that remains even when our proposed loss is zero. Therefore, yes, as you say, this clearly indicates our loss can only be used to approximate Nash equilibria (hence the title of the paper).\n- The scope of this work is normal-form games, which is the natural starting point for studying more complex game settings and arguably the bedrock of most traditional economic theory. If by real-world games, you mean games like poker (extensive-form) or some video games (Markov games), then yes, we do not cover that in this work. We mention extensive-form games as one of our future goals in the conclusion.\n- Figure 2 presents an empirical analysis of the existence of saddle points as indicated by the colors of points in the scatter plots. We also verify in Appendix K.4 that the Hessian of our loss evaluated at the final iterate of SGD in Figure 3 in both Blotto experiments contains both positive and negative eigenvalues, i.e, the landscape is saddle-shaped.\n\nWe now answer your questions:\n1) The structure of symmetric games can be exploited in our approach. Recall that every symmetric NFG has a symmetric NE. Therefore, we can reduce our search space over joint profiles of size $nm$ to a search over a single playerâs mixed strategy of size $m$. Moreover, if you inspect the gradient of our loss in equation (9) which contains a sum over all players $k$, we can simplify this as well to a sum over player $\\ell$ and any single player $k \\ne \\ell$ (scaled by $n-1$). Due to symmetry and the fact that all players play the same background strategy in a symmetric NE, each of the summands is the same, so we only need to retain one. See Figure 4 where we explicitly take advantage of the symmetry of the game to both solve it and visualize it; we present all player strategies as a single 1-d variable ($p$) on the x-axis. If instead of player / payoff-symmetry, you meant action-symmetry, then yes, grouping actions would help to scale our approach when two actions are equivalent.\n2) We believe this is a very interesting direction for future work. We have tried Adam actually on Blotto (10c, 3f, 4p) by reparameterizing the mixed strategy as a softmax over real-valued logits (vanilla Adam assumes unconstrained optimization). We found that Adam improves on SGD slightly ($\\epsilon$ drops from $0.029$ to $0.020$), but we still see a saddle-shape in the landscape when we inspect the loss at Adamâs final step. This suggests Adam helped cope with the saddle point problem, but is not a complete solution. We explicitly decided against including these preliminary results so as to encourage follow-up work by non-convex / deep-learning optimization experts with respect to a variety of non-vanila SGD algorithms such as Adam, Adagrad, saddle-point  avoidant solvers, learning-to-learn approaches, a.o. We believe that the ICLR audience would be the perfect set of experts to take this on.\n3) A simple heuristic would be to regularize our proposed loss with a second loss term encoding an additional criterion, e.g., maximizing welfare. You could anneal this term over learning to try to find the equilibrium with the highest welfare.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for your positive review and for your constructive feedback!\n\nWe agree, the empirical section 6.2 is quite short and there are several details (in particular, descriptions of the baselines) in Appendix K that we will pull into the main body.\n\nWe also appreciate your suggestion regarding flow.

Moreover, only the MLP and convolutional layers have been tested in the experiments. The paper could be improved a lot if it experimentally showed that the other types of proposed layers can also help improve the performance of their model. \n\nThank you for the suggestion. We provide recipes for normalization layers and multi-head self-attention layers in the updated manuscript in appendix C. For completeness, we also describe the two types of building blocks here.\n\nNormalization layers, e.g. BatchNorm [3] and LayerNorm [4] are formulated as $\\mathbf{y} = \\gamma \\odot \\mathbf{x} + \\beta$, which can be rewritten as a linear layer with diagonal weights $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\gamma) \\mathbf{x} + \\beta$. As such, we can treat normalization layers like linear layers: given $d$ nodes that represent the $d$-dimensional input to the normalization layer $\\mathbf{x}$, we add an additional $d$ nodes that correspond to the $d$-dimensional output $\\mathbf{y}$. The additional node features capture the additive terms $\\beta$, while the edge features capture the multiplicative terms $\\gamma$. We only add edges from $\\mathbf{x}_i$ to the corresponding $\\mathbf{y}_i$ to model the element-wise multiplication.\n\nMulti-head self-attention layers initially apply linear projections to the inputs $\\mathbf{X}$. In total, assuming H heads, we have $3H$ linear layers applied independently to the inputs. \n$$ \\mathbf{Q}_h = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_h^Q, \\mathbf{K}_h = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_h^K, \\mathbf{V}_h = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_h^V, h \\in \\{1, \\ldots, H\\} $$\nEach head is followed by a dot-product attention layer $\\mathbf{Y}_h = \\mathrm{s}(\\mathbf{Q}_h \\mathbf{K}_h^T) \\mathbf{V}_h$, where $\\mathrm{s}$ is the softmax function.\nFinally, we concatenate all heads and perform a final linear projection:\n$ \\textrm{MHSA}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\mathrm{Concat}(\\mathbf{Y}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{Y}_H) \\mathbf{W}^O$\n\nA multi-head self attention layer takes $d$-dimensional vectors as inputs and produces $d_H$-dimensional vectors as output of each head, which are then concatenated and linearly projected to $d$ dimensions. In the neural graph construction, we add $d$ nodes for each dimension of the input, $H \\cdot d_H$ nodes for each dimension of each head, and $d$ nodes for each dimension of the output. \nWe model the 3 different types of linear projections with multidimensional edge features. More specifically, for each edge feature we have $\\mathbf{e}_{ij}^h=\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{W}_h^Q\\right)\\_{ij}, \\left(\\mathbf{W}_h^K\\right)\\_{ij}, \\left(\\mathbf{W}_h^V\\right)\\_{ij}\\right)$. Since dot-product attention is a parameter-free operation, we don't model explicitly and allow the neural graph network to approximate it. The concatenation of all heads is automatically handled by the neural graph itself by connecting the appropriate nodes from each head through the output weights $\\mathbf{W}^O$ to the corresponding output node. The final projection $\\mathbf{W}^O$ is treated as a standard linear layer.\n\n> The paper also does not discuss the expressive power of their approach compared to the baselines, \n>\n> Is the expressive power of the proposed approach the same as the baselines?\n\nThank you for the suggestion. Navon et al. [1] characterize the expressive power of DWSNet by showing its ability to approximate the forward pass of an MLP with ReLU activations. In the new Appendix B, we demonstrate that an MPNN applied to neural graphs can achieve this too. \n\n> The paper does not discuss how difficult it is to scale their approach to very large neural networks/graphs.\n\nOur neural graph scales linearly with the number of parameters in the input neural network. The complexity of the graph neural network (or Transformer) decides whether it can scale to very large neural networks as inputs. Message passing neural networks typically have linear complexity, whereas Transformer has quadratic complexity in the number of nodes - this number is typically much smaller than the number of parameters/edges. Much research is being done to apply graph neural networks and Transformers to larger inputs, and applying those advances to neural graphs is an exciting future research direction.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author response to Reviewer rtFz (2)'}, 'comment': {'value': '> I consider the empirical results to be quite complete, but an ablation of the various design decisions introduced would be valuable.

It is not clear to me that this is a 1:1 correspondence for all graphs considered. However, it is stated that this can be shown (Sec 2.1).\n\nWe now formalize these claims in the new Appendix A. In particular, we show that the neuron symmetry group (i.e. the symmetry in the parameter space) is a subgroup of the symmetric group (i.e. the symmetry for the neural graph). This means that for a specific neural network architecture, all its permutation symmetries in the parameter space can be expressed as permutations in the nodes of the neural graph.\n\nThe above implies that any model that is equivariant with respect to the symmetric group is automatically equivariant with respect to the symmetries in the parameter space. Hence, it ensures invariance to neuron symmetries.\n\n> You observe that the baseline methods are able to perform equally well on the training loss, but fail to generalize as well (Sec 4.1). Why do you think this is? Did you explore adding regularization or similar to the baseline methods to help with generalization? I wonder if the probe features or other modifications are providing some of this benefit for the proposed method.\n\nDue to the difference in the symmetry group captured by the baselines (as we outline above), the baselines have a different parameter sharing pattern. In particular, both NFN [2] and DWSNet [1] have different parameters for different layers in the input neural network. This can make them more prone to overfitting, leading to worse generalization. Weâve added Figure 5 in Appendix A that shows that our approach achieves better test loss than the baseline, even when the train loss is the same for both. Furthermore, note that the hyperparameters of the baselines are well tuned. In particular, Navon et al. report in their appendix that DWSNet is trained using AdamW with weight decay and Batch-Normalization for improved generalization, and further applied grid search to select the optimal learning rate.\n\n> In Section 2.3, non-linearities are described as being added to the node features. Is this done via concatenation? And what is done when there is no activation?\n\nNon-linearities are represented by learnable embeddings (one for each type of non-linearity) and are added to the existing node features. No activation can be seen as another âtype of non-linearityâ; we use one more learnable embedding that corresponds to the identity activation.\n\n### References\n\n[1] Aviv Navon, Aviv Shamsian, Idan Achituve, Ethan Fetaya, Gal Chechik, and Haggai Maron.

To use the method, the user must first specify a maximum kernel size. While this is unlikely to be a problem in practice, because the kernel size of modern CNNs does not vary much, it is not obvious how to extend this to other network layers that exhibit parameter sharing. For example, attention layers share parameters over sequence length which may vary significantly more than kernel size.\n\nIndeed, our construction requires prior knowledge on a maximum allowed kernel size. Note, however, that the maximum kernel size merely decides the input feature dimensions of the edges. On the other hand, the parameter sharing of attention layers is more comparable to how a shared convolutional kernel is applied over the different spatial regions. Hence, the graph construction for attention layers is unaffected by the variability in the sequence length, similar to how it is unaffected by the variability in the image size for CNNs.\n\n> Moreover, other standard building blocks like normalization layers are not covered in this work and there is no clear recipe provided for designing the corresponding neural graph representations.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We provide recipes for normalization layers and multi-head self-attention layers in the updated manuscript in appendix C. For completeness, we also describe the two types of building blocks here.\n\nNormalization layers, e.g. BatchNorm [3] and LayerNorm [4] are formulated as $\\mathbf{y} = \\gamma \\odot \\mathbf{x} + \\beta$, which can be rewritten as a linear layer with diagonal weights $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\gamma) \\mathbf{x} + \\beta$. As such, we can treat normalization layers like linear layers: given $d$ nodes that represent the $d$-dimensional input to the normalization layer $\\mathbf{x}$, we add an additional $d$ nodes that correspond to the $d$-dimensional output $\\mathbf{y}$. The additional node features capture the additive terms $\\beta$, while the edge features capture the multiplicative terms $\\gamma$. We only add edges from $\\mathbf{x}_i$ to the corresponding $\\mathbf{y}_i$ to model the element-wise multiplication.\n\nMulti-head self-attention layers initially apply linear projections to the inputs $\\mathbf{X}$. In total, assuming H heads, we have $3H$ linear layers applied independently to the inputs. \n$$ \\mathbf{Q}_h = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_h^Q, \\mathbf{K}_h = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_h^K, \\mathbf{V}_h = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_h^V, h \\in \\{1, \\ldots, H\\} $$\nEach head is followed by a dot-product attention layer $\\mathbf{Y}_h = \\mathrm{s}(\\mathbf{Q}_h \\mathbf{K}_h^T) \\mathbf{V}_h$, where $\\mathrm{s}$ is the softmax function.\nFinally, we concatenate all heads and perform a final linear projection:\n$ \\textrm{MHSA}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\mathrm{Concat}(\\mathbf{Y}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{Y}_H) \\mathbf{W}^O$\n\nA multi-head self attention layer takes $d$-dimensional vectors as inputs and produces $d_H$-dimensional vectors as output of each head, which are then concatenated and linearly projected to $d$ dimensions. In the neural graph construction, we add $d$ nodes for each dimension of the input, $H \\cdot d_H$ nodes for each dimension of each head, and $d$ nodes for each dimension of the output. \nWe model the 3 different types of linear projections with multidimensional edge features. More specifically, for each edge feature we have $\\mathbf{e}_{ij}^h=\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{W}_h^Q\\right)\\_{ij}, \\left(\\mathbf{W}_h^K\\right)\\_{ij}, \\left(\\mathbf{W}_h^V\\right)\\_{ij}\\right)$. Since dot-product attention is a parameter-free operation, we do not model it explicitly and let the neural graph network approximate it. The concatenation of all heads is automatically handled by the neural graph itself by connecting the appropriate nodes from each head through the output weights $\\mathbf{W}^O$ to the corresponding output node. The final projection $\\mathbf{W}^O$ is treated as a standard linear layer.\n\nWeâve covered a variety of popular architectural choices including convolutions, skip connections, and different activation functions, which serve as inspiration for how other neural network components can be turned into neural graphs.\n\n\n> There is little theoretical justification for the proposed approach. Prior work proves the expressivity of their methods alongside their group equivariance properties. Neither of these are explored formally in this work.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. Navon et al.

We further observe that using only 4 probe features (less than 1% of the number of pixels) already leads to significant improvements.

[1] (i.e. the same one that we used for the classification setting). In that dataset, the INRs are trained to predict an intensity value in the range of [0, 1], whereas the dataset created by Zhou et al. [2] trains the INRs with a target range of [-1, 1]. This difference in the target range implies a different scale for the mean-squared error. \n\nFor completeness, we also retrain our GNN and Transformer using the MNIST variant from Zhou et al.

In Kitchen, since the downstream task is explicitly defined with four sub-tasks, the high-level policy should pick a large number of unique goals on average.\nIn the Cobblestone task, the high-level policy can simply choose to dig down without switching to other goals, thus the policy converges to always picking a unique goal. The Iron task is similar to Cobblestone but is much more challenging in its long-horizon nature.

The reasons why SPiRL fails are threefold:\n- SPiRL models behaviors in compact Gaussian latent variables $p(z|s_t,a_{t:t+k})$ regularized with KL divergence, which cannot accurately distinguish diverse behaviors in the large-scale dataset.\n- The low-level policy in SPiRL decodes multi-step actions at one state $\\pi(a_{t:t+k}|s_t,z)$, which cannot accurately reconstruct the high-dimensional long action sequences in open-world domains. Thus, it fails to execute many complicated skills in Minecraft (e.g. breaking a log requires taking more than 10 attack actions repeatedly).\n- In SPiRL, the high-level policy acts in the continuous skill space $z$, making downstream RL inefficient (especially for long-horizon tasks in high-dimensional environments).\n  \nTo address these issues respectively, PTGM provides novel approaches that: \n- It models behaviors with goals (states in the dataset).\n- The goal-conditioned policy $\\pi(a_t|s_t,s^g)$ learns one-step action prediction on each state. Such a low-level policy can perform diverse skills accurately as presented in [2].\n- The high-level policy acts in the discretized goal space.\nTo this end, the methods of goal space clustering and goal prior regularization are also our original contributions to implementing such a framework.\n\nWe agree that this discussion is helpful for readers to understand our work better and add it to Appendix B.2.\n\n[1] Accelerating Reinforcement Learning with Learned Skill Priors, 2021\n\n[2] STEVE-1: A Generative Model for Text-to-Behavior in Minecraft, 2023\n\n**Q2.** Section 3.1 says âWe study tasks that provide binary rewards, offering a reward of +1 only upon reaching a non-trivial success stateâ.\n\n**A2.** Thanks for pointing out our writing mistakes! We revised the above sentence since we use a MineCLIP reward in Minecraft. \nWe claim in Section 5.2 (the **VPT-finetune.** paragraph) that such reward cannot lead vanilla RL to task success.

Is fine-tuning the low-level policy with RL explored?\n\n**A3.** We assume that the task-agnostic dataset contains non-trivial behaviors generated by the agent (e.g. human players) while performing various tasks in the environment. Though trajectories in the dataset are sub-optimal for solving downstream tasks, the short-term behaviors $a_{t:t+k}$ in the dataset represent meaningful skills and can be combined sequentially to accomplish downstream tasks better. Recent work [4] also demonstrates that stitching short-term goals from sub-optimal data can lead to better performance. We revised the second paragraph in Section 3.1 to clarify it.\n\nFinetuning to further improve the performance of the low-level policy is promising and remains unexplored in the literature of pre-training for RL. In future work, we could pre-train the goal-conditioned policy with offline RL methods and finetune it with online data collected in downstream tasks.\n\n[4] Waypoint Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Learning with Intermediate Targets, 2023\n\n**Q4.** The caption in Table 1 should be rephrased for clarity.\n\n**A4.** Thanks!

This satisfies our problem formulation that low-level behaviors are learned from a large task-agnostic dataset and the high-level policy can reuse the pre-trained skills to learn arbitrary tasks.\nFor downstream tasks, the behaviors of combatting spiders and harvesting water buckets rarely appears in the dataset. Our method can stitch and generalize the goals to accomplish these tasks.\n\n[5] Video PreTraining (VPT): Learning to Act by Watching Unlabeled Online Videos, 2022'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Thanks for your review!

About using SPiRL, VPT, and Steve-1 as baselines.\n\n**A1.** Thanks for pointing out these related works! We have to emphasize that the main literature we study is ""pre-training from data to accelerate RL"", in which we find specific issues in learning skills from large task-agnostic datasets in open worlds (the third paragraph in Section 1) and propose the first goal-based approach PTGM to address this problem. While GCRL is related to our study, most works in GCRL are orthogonal to our work in the problem formulation (though we admit that techniques proposed in GCRL can be alternative implementations of some components in PTGM). TACO-RL[1] studies hierarchical approaches in fully offline RL; DGRL[2] studies goal representation learning for GCRL, which is not an issue considered in our study and can be used as an alternative method to provide goal representations for PTGM as discussed in Section 6. We added these related works in Section 2.\n\nNevertheless, we take your comments and implement an online RL variant for TACO-RL to fit our settings. We update the results in Figure 2. While TACO holds competitive performance in harvest water bucket, it fails on other Minecraft tasks. \nWe discuss that TACO has the following drawbacks compared with PTGM:\n- TACO provides a continuous high-level action space for downstream RL, which makes the high-level policy likely to output unseen latent skills and is harmful for sample-efficiency.\n- TACO requires manually picking a state representing the task goal for each downstream task. While the goal state for each task is deterministic in simple domains experimented in TACO-RL and SPiRL, the goal image for a Minecraft task can be diverse (e.g., for Harvest Log, there are various kinds of trees in Minecraft and the agent has diverse view angles), making it difficult to learn a good skill prior to enhance high-level RL.\n\nAbout the necessity of our selected baselines: \n- Though SPiRL was proposed in 2021, it is a strong baseline in the field of ""pre-training skills from task-agnostic data for RL"". Recent papers [3,4] under this setting also adopt this baseline.\n- VPT+RL is actually the strongest baseline in Minecraft which adopts the same setting of pre-training + RL finetuning. As reported in [5], it can solve the most challenging tasks in Minecraft with billions of environment steps.\n- Steve-1 uses the same goal-conditioned controller as our method and can serve as a strong baseline for Minecraft tasks. While Steve-1 maps goals to language instructions to build a multi-task agent, our high-level policy learned with RL can overcome its limitations that 1. cannot switch goals to perform hierarchical long-horizon control; 2. fails on tasks with unseen instructions. \n\n[1] Latent plans for task-agnostic offline reinforcement learning, 2022\n\n[2] Discrete factorial representations as an abstraction for goal conditioned reinforcement learning, 2022\n\n[3] Skill-Critic: Refining Learned Skills for Reinforcement Learning, 2023\n\n[4] Subwords as Skills: Tokenization for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning, 2023\n\n[5] Video PreTraining (VPT): Learning to Act by Watching Unlabeled Online Videos, 2022\n\n\n**Q2.** About cluster visualization in Figure 4.\n\n**A2.** Thanks!

Here, we respond to your comments and address the issues. We hope to hear back from you if you have further questions!'}, 'comment': {'value': '**Q1.** Ablations are fairly limited and leave several unanswered questions.\n\n**A1.** Thanks for your valuable suggestions to improve our ablation studies! We added ablation results in different number of clusters and low-level steps in Section 5.3. Results for both Log and Spider are presented in Appendix E and we will add results in all other tasks later.\nWe summarize our conclusions below. More discussions can be found in Section 5.3 and Appendix E.\n\nFor the choice of cluster numbers:\n- With N=10, the agent fails to improve the task success rates, due to the low capacity of behaviors in the small goal space.  But the task success rates are non-zero, due to the generalization ability of the low-level policy.\n- With an increasing number of goal clusters, the performance of PTGM is robust, while the sample efficiency and stability slightly decrease due to the larger high-level action space. \n- PTGM-no-cluster fails on all tasks, which is caused by ineffectiveness of RL acting in high-dimensional continuous action spaces. It can be viewed as the case where infinite number of goals are either in clusters or inexistent in the dataset. \n\nFor the choice of the number of low-level steps:\n- With a small number of low-level steps (k=10), the behavior is offloaded more to the high-level policy, resulting in worse sample efficiency of RL. \n- With an increasing number of low-level steps, PTGM shows better sample efficiency and success rates. k=100 is a good choice for all the Minecraft tasks, where the high-level controller is able to switch about 10 goals per episode. \n- With k=500, PTGM converges to a lower performance compared with k=100 because the behavior is offloaded too much to the low-level policy. In this case, the high-level policy cannot switch many goals in an episode, making the task performance limited by the capability of the low-level controller conditioned on a single goal.\n\n\n**Q2.** Lacking implementation details on the method and the baselines. Explanation about the VPT baseline in Kitchen.\n\n**A2.** We enrich the implementation details of our method in Appendix A and the baselines in Appendix B. \nAs explained in Section 5.2 (the ""**VPT-finetune.**"" paragraph), the VPT baseline in Kitchen is named BC-finetune, which pre-trains a behavior-cloning low-level policy and finetunes it with RL. Its failure is related to the lack of temporal abstraction for RL and the forgetting issue during RL finetuning. Pertsch et al. [1] report the similar results of this baseline in Kitchen.\n\n[1] Accelerating Reinforcement Learning with Learned Skill Priors, 2021\n\n\n**Q3.** Why don\'t we initialize the high-level policy with the goal prior in RL?\n\n**A3.** We conduct an ablation study that initializes the high-level policy with the goal prior model (PTGM-prior-init). As shown in Appendix E, Figure 11, PTGM-prior-init outperforms PTGM only on harvesting logs, but has worse performance in other Minecraft tasks. \nWe find that since chopping trees is the most frequent behavior in the Minecraft Contractor dataset, the behavior-cloning models learned from such data can draw higher probabilities on harvesting logs than other behaviors. Thus, PTGM-prior-init is biased to the task of harvesting logs and fails to explore for other tasks in which the goal prior model draws low probabilities on the task-relevant goals. On the contrary, PTGM with random initialization of the high-level policy adopts a uniform goal prior for exploration, showing strong capabilities in solving out-of-distribution tasks.\nSince our problem formulation is to learn from **task-agnostic** data and finetune for arbitrary tasks, we believe that uniformly exploring in the goal space for RL is better.\n\n**Q4.** Are discrete goals really necessary for the simpler Kitchen environment? \n\n**A4.** We answer this question by implementing the action space of the high-level policy with the state space of Kitchen without clustering (PTGM-no-cluster). The results are presented in Appendix D, Figure 8.\nThough the dimension of the goal in Kitchen is relatively lower (21 dimensions), we find that PTGM-no-cluster fails in this task. We observe that, with the continuous action space, the high-level policy should learn to output valid goals that lay in the manifold of states from the dataset to make the low-level policy perform reasonable behaviors. On the contrary, for PTGM with discrete goal clusters, the output of the high-level policy is always a valid goal (in the clusters), making RL efficient. Though the KL reward encourages PTGM-no-cluster to output goals close to the goal prior, it cannot make the output accurate enough due to the Gaussian sampling of the action head.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'This paper studies the problem of learning diverse and temporally extended behaviors using hierarchical RL with access to large, pre-existing datasets. The proposed method, PTGM, pre-trains (1) a goal-conditioned low-level policy using behavior cloning, and (2) a goal prior in a discrete space of goal clusters, both of which are extracted from a large pre-existing behavior dataset. After pre-training these two components, PTGM then trains a high-level RL policy to select goals for the goal-conditioned low-level policy to reach. A key technical contribution that sets this method apart from prior work is the use of a discrete goal space (by means of clustering), which greatly reduces the action space of the high-level policy that is learned via RL (as opposed to continuous goal embeddings). The authors argue that this discretization plays a key role in improving exploration during RL training.\n\nExperiments are conducted on two task domains: a kitchen environment in which a robotic manipulator is tasked with manipulating multiple objects sequentially based on state inputs, and 5 visual tasks from MineDojo which is based on the open-world video game Minecraft.

Firstly, it is evident that too few clusters (10) fails to capture the diversity of the goal space, and that no clustering fails to learn at all. However, it is not clear to me what the breaking point would be in terms of number of clusters: would e.g. 5,000 clusters lead to similar or *more* diverse behaviors than 500 clusters, or would it collapse to similar performance as the no-clustering ablation? Similarly, it is not clear based on the ablation on the number of low-level steps that more than 100 steps (thus offloading more of the learning to behavior cloning rather than RL) would lead to worse behaviors. Given that the low-level policy is trained on a very large dataset, I imagine that behavior cloning over longer horizons, e.g., 1,000 steps, could still lead to very meaningful behaviors. Additionally, # of clusters and # of steps are highly dependent hyper-parameters given that they jointly balance how much of the behavior should be offloaded to the high-level RL policy vs. the low-level BC policy, but I didn't find any discussion or results that highlight this. Lastly, could the authors please clarify why the third ablation is conducted on Spider rather than the Log task like the two other ablations?\n- The paper is lacking in terms of implementation details on the proposed method + the baselines. It would be helpful if the paper was more self-contained and described the overall architecture etc. in the appendix rather than simply referencing prior work. Additionally, in cases where baselines are adapted to new domains yet fail completely (e.g., VPT for the Kitchen environment), I would appreciate if the authors could share some thoughts on why this might be, even if not backed by data.""}, 'questions': {'value': ""I have a couple of additional questions that I would also appreciate if the authors could address:\n- I understand the motivation behind the KL weight and that neither alpha=0 (no prior) nor too large of a weight are desirable. However, it appears that the authors choose to train the high-level policy from scratch and only leverage the goal prior to guide exploration. Given that the goal prior and high-level policy share the same action space, why do the authors decide against initializing the high-level policy as the goal prior and simply finetuning it using the proposed objective (reward + KL)?\n- I am left wondering how many of the design choices in the proposed framework are uniquely beneficial for MineDojo due to its enormous state and action space. For example, are discrete goals really necessary for the simpler Kitchen environment compared to providing the raw physical state as a continuous goal? The MineDojo results are surely impressive, but it would be useful to contextualize the proposed method and design choices more for other domains besides MineDojo, with or without additional experiments to back any claims.\n\n**Post-rebuttal:** I have revised my rating (6 -> 8) and confidence (3 -> 4) based on the authors' response to my comments, as well as those of my fellow reviewers.""}, 'flag_for_ethics_review': {'value': ['No ethics review needed.']}, 'rating': {'value': '8: accept, good paper'}, 'confidence': {'value': '4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain.

Unfair comparison with DDPM and FID evaluation for different NFE**\nWe totally agree with the reviewer\'s suggestion and we have removed DDPM from the table. \n\nFor AGM, We reported the performance of our model at 0.8M training iteration which turns out the model is under-trained. After the submission, we kept training the model for another 0.8 iterations and now the performance has increased dramatically.

We acknowledge that this limitation is one of the drawbacks of our approach.

The clarity of the paper will be better if the conditions of the Lemmas and Propositions written in this paper is stated more concretely**\nThank you for raising this issue. we have made revisions to the notations and refined the statements of the lemmas and propositions (Lemma 7 and Section D.10 in appendix, Proposition 5 in main paper).\n#### **2. Both this method and CLD make predictions of the data from both the current state and the velocity, providing the data prediction result from CLD.**\nThank you for mentioning this aspect which is indeed valuable. \n\nIt has come to our attention that the training objective of CLD solely focuses on the score function with respect to velocity (scaled $\\epsilon_1$). Consequently, there is no apparent method for CLD to effectively reconstruct the data point using the intermediate state and velocity. Specifically, in order to reconstruct $x_1$,the information of stochasticity in the position channel, denoted as $\\epsilon_{0}$, is required. However, it is important to note that this information is not available after the training phase of CLD. Therefore, the reconstruction of $x_1$ is not feasible.\n\nIn our case, the special structure of acceleration, which includes the stochasticity information of state and velocity channel (eq.9 in revision), allows us to reconstruct the $x_1$ (Proposition.5).\n\nTo address any confusion resulting from our previous insufficient explanation, we have included additional clarification in Section 3.2 in revision.\n\n#### **3.

As a result, We report the performance of baseline models from a recent paper (see Table.8 from [1]).\n\nFor AGM, We reported the performance of our model at 0.8M training iteration which turns out that the model was under-trained.

Trajectory of acceleration**\nWe have added the plot of position, and velocity together with acceleration in the appendix G in the revision. Upon reviewing Appendix G, it becomes evident that the trajectories of the variables remain consistent over varying NFEs, despite the trajectories of any variable not being perfectly linear in the infinite timestep limit.\n#### **8. The problem formulation ignores the regularization of acceleration**\nWe would like to respectfully stress that the regularization of the acceleration $||a_t||_2^2$ is not ignored in our framework (see, eg, Equation 5).\n\nTo be more precise, as $r$ approaches positive infinity, there still exist multiple possible stochastic processes which start from $x_0$ at $t=0$ and converge to $x_1$ at $t=1$ and all of them are minimizers of the objective function **without** regularization. Among these processes, our preferred stochastic process should also minimize the control effort $\\int_{0}^{1}||a_t||_2^2 dt$ (regularization). This solution, which aligns with the unique solution presented in Definition 2 (In general, the solution of SOC is not unique. But in our simple Linear Quadratic case, the solution is unique, see Theorem 6.1 in [this textbook](https://www.control.utoronto.ca/people/profs/kwong/ece410/2008/notes/chap6-08.pdf)), is what we have employed to construct our methodology.\n\nTo address any confusion that may have arisen, we have provided additional clarification in Appendix C.1 in the revision.

The work launched hundreds of papers purporting to improve over the postprocessing baseline. We empirically evaluate these claims through thousands of model evaluations on several tabular datasets. We find that the fairness-accuracy Pareto frontier achieved by postprocessing contains all other methods we were feasibly able to evaluate. In doing so, we address two common methodological errors that have confounded previous observations. One relates to the comparison of methods with different unconstrained base models. The other concerns methods achieving different levels of constraint relaxation. At the heart of our study is a simple idea we call unprocessing that roughly corresponds to the inverse of postprocessing. Unprocessing allows for a direct comparison of methods using different underlying models and levels of relaxation.",Oral 5B,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=jr03SfWsBS,https://openreview.net/forum?id=jr03SfWsBS,jr03SfWsBS,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'The message of this paper is ""If, however, the goal is to equalize error rates exactly or approximately, the simplest way of doing so\nis optimal: Take the best available unconstrained model and optimize over group-specific thresholds.""\n\nThis is an important conclusion that deserves to be widely known and debated.

We appreciate that your review acknowledges the strength of our ""extensive empirical experiments"". This is indeed our main contribution. \n\nRest assured, we\'re intimately familiar with Theorem 5.6 in Hardt et al (2016). Theorem 5.6 shows that assuming a predictor is (close to) Bayes optimal, its postprocessed version is (close to) optimal among all equalized odds classifiers. This is a wonderful theoretical result, but it only strengthes the significance of our empirical results. The reason is that the theorem, of course, cannot tell you if its assumptions are met in real settings. Indeed, there is no general way of knowing what the Bayes error is on any given dataset. Likewise, there is no way of knowing if classifiers trained in real settings are close enough to Bayes optimal (in the Kolmogorov distance required by the theorem) in order for the theorem to kick in. Our empirical work shows that this is the case, thus settling a question left open for many years by the theorem you cite.\n\nYou may have misunderstood the role of unprocessing in our work. Unprocessing is not a method we propose to achieve a fairness constraint. Unprocessing is a tool we use to put our empirical evaluation on a level playing field. The issue is, a priori, that one fairness method may be superior to another simply because it starts from a better unconstrained classifier. By unprocessing all methods first, we put them on a level playing field. It\'s a tool, both necessary and useful, for the fair evaluation of different methods. The fact that unprocessing is, intuitively speaking, the inverse of postprocessing is the whole point. This, again, does not diminish the significance of our empirical work. Rather it\'s a contribution we make to point out that unprocessing can be used to compare fairness methods that start from different base models. This is a useful idea that we\'re sure will find use in future work.\n\nWe sincerely hope that you will reconsider your negative rating of our work. We think that it is entirely reasonable for an ICLR paper to be applied and empirical, rather than theoretical. Thank you very much for your efforts in carefully evaluating our work.\n\nPS: The datasets we use are widely accepted to be superior to many earlier datasets (such as German credit - 1000 data points from 1994, or UCI Adult) that were used in the area before. This case was argued in Ding et al. (2021) and researchers have since generally switched to the datasets we use.

We address each question in the following paragraphs.\n\n**Q2**\n> Have you considered putting your approach into a popular package so that researchers can quickly and easily compare their models?\n\nThank you for bringing this up. We've open-sourced our implementation in a standalone python package (link to [anonymized repository](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/error-parity-8550/README.md) in the paper). Our implementation is easy-to-use and compatible with any score-based classifier (examples [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/error-parity-8550/examples/relaxed-equalized-odds.usage-example-folktables.ipynb)). Additionally, to reach a potentially wider audience, we have open Pull Requests to include our implementation on a popular algorithmic fairness python package (will be linked in the paper after deanonymization period), although this will expectedly still take some weeks of work to be made compatible with that package's API and structure.\n\n**W1**\n\nThank you for raising this concern.\n\nAchieving error-rate parity was detailed by Hardt et al. (2016). The relaxed solution is more nuanced (since we can no longer rely on the intersection of all group-specific ROC curves), but the key idea is similar: using randomized thresholds allows us to access the convex hull of each group-specific ROC curve (while deterministic thresholds only allow us to access specific discrete ROC points). This makes it so the optimization domain is convex (the group-specific ROC convex-hulls), and hence easy to optimize over. While this is an efficient solution to the problem, a simple brute-force approach would also be possible (brute force implementation example [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/error-parity-8550/examples/brute-force-example_equalized-odds-thresholding.ipynb)). \nAs linear optimization has been widely studied in the literature, we cite reference works such as Boyd and Vandenberghe (2004) for details on how to solve the LP.\nAccording to reviewer feedback, we were in fact torn between keeping this section in the paper or in the appendix, but as per your feedback we will maintain it in the main paper body.\n\n**W2**\n\nThank you for raising this point. Appendix B details the infrastructure we used to conduct our experiments. Note that the run-times in Fig. 5 correspond to model training times using a single CPU-core per job (to allow for high job parallelization and a more efficient use of CPU nodes). We do believe that the variety of datasets and models tested significantly contributes to the generalizability of our findings. For full transparency, we will further detail the compute usage of our experiments in Appendix B.\n \n**W3**\n\nWe agree that our approach is definitely intuitive. At the same time, the algorithmic fairness literature contains a wide range of fairness-aware inprocessing and preprocessing methods that claim to dominate results achieved by a simple postprocessing baseline. In our work, we show that this outperformance can be due to (1) comparing models at different levels of constraint violation, or (2) postprocessing a lower-performance model; both are arguably instances of unfair evaluation standards. Acting on each stage of the ML pipeline undoubtedly has specific advantages (e.g., preprocessing is potentially compatible with any downstream task/model, and can be useful when you have to hand over the data to a third party). With this meta study, we hope to have made the advantage of postprocessing clear: given accurate risk-score estimates, postprocessing can retrieve any optimal fairness-accuracy trade-off.""}}, {'comment': {'value': ""Thank you for your encouraging review and valuable feedback. We address each question in the following paragraphs.\n\n**Q1**\n\nThank you for bringing this up. The LP formulation is actually paramount to the usefulness of our method, as an exhaustive search over all threshold combinations scales exponentially with the number of groups, and scales quadratically with the number of thresholds that the underlying predictor accepts. To clarify, an exhaustive search would have to span all combinations of group-specific _randomized thresholds_ in order to access the interior of each group's ROC curve (by using deterministic single-value thresholds we can only access specific discrete points in the exterior of each group's ROC curve). That is, each groupâs decision function is represented by 2 values, $\\{(\\underline{t}_s, \\overline{t}_s) : (\\underline{t}_s, \\overline{t}_s) \\in \\mathcal{T}^2 \\land  \\underline{t}_s \\leq \\overline{t}_s\\}, \\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. Samples of group $s$ whose score is lower than $\\underline{t}_s$ are classified negatively ($\\hat{Y}=0$), samples whose score is higher than $\\overline{t}_s$ are classified positively ($\\hat{Y}=1$), and samples whose score is in the range $\\left[\\underline{t}_s, \\overline{t}_s\\right]$ are classified randomly by a coin toss [Hardt et al., 2016, Section 3.2].\n\nFor example, a coarse search grid over deterministic thresholds of $\\mathcal{T} = \\{0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0\\}$, includes randomized thresholds $\\{ (0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.1), ..., (0.0, 1.0), (0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.2), ... \\}$, a total of $\\frac{\\left|\\mathcal{T}\\right|(\\left|\\mathcal{T}\\right|+1)}{2}$ combinations (scales quadratically with $\\left|\\mathcal{T}\\right|$). Perhaps more importantly, if $\\mathcal{A}$ is the set of randomized thresholds, the search space will span $\\mathcal{A}^{|\\mathcal{G}|}$ different threshold combinations, where $|\\mathcal{G}|$ is the number of sensitive groups.\n\nWe've implemented an exhaustive-search solver and **added an example notebook** to the examples folder in the anonymized repository linked in the paper ([link here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/error-parity-8550/examples/brute-force-example_equalized-odds-thresholding.ipynb)). Running an extremely coarse grid of $|\\mathcal{T}|=11$ thresholds on our main experiment ($|\\mathcal{G}|=4$) leads to over $9\\text{M}$ combinations. With our implementation, a small experiment using $|\\mathcal{G}|=2$ and $|\\mathcal{T}|=8$ takes 3 minutes to run over the $4356$ combinations with an exhaustive-search solver, while the LP solver takes 109ms to achieve a superior solution (because the search grid is finer).\n\n**W1**\n\nThank you for this suggestion. We've **added these comparisons in a new Appendix A.6** to the latest paper revision. Namely, we compare fairness and accuracy results for postprocessing and fairness-constraining the same model class (e.g., FairGBM compared to postprocessed GBM), or unprocessing and unconstrained training of the same model class (e.g., unprocessed FairGBM compared to GBM).\n\nPlease let us know of any further suggestions you'd find beneficial for the presentation of our work.\n\n**W2**\n\nWe agree that our most significant contributions are empirical, and describing the LP is not particularly novel. However, as all our findings rely on the proposed relaxed postprocessing method, we believe that a clear definition of this optimization problem should be in the body of the paper; additionally clarifying how exactly relaxed postprocessing differs from strict postprocessing (whose LP solution is detailed by Hardt et al. (2016)).

We address each question in the following paragraphs.\n\n---\n> According to Equation 1, unprocessing starts from the postprocessed Å¶ and aims to find the unconstrained optimized predictor. How can we do that with obliviously postprocessed Å¶?\n\nThank you for raising this question. The postprocessing procedure we propose is analogous to that  of Hardt et al. (2016), only with a partially relaxed fairness constraint. Specifically, both procedures operate on _the scores_ of a score-based predictor, by finding the optimal group-specific decision-boundary (minimal loss while fulfilling the constraint). As such, these procedures are ""oblivious"", in the sense that they are functions of the joint distribution of $(Y, A, R)$, and do not consider the features $X$ directly.\n\n> How to make sure the unprocessed predictor has a sensible mapping from input features to target variable?\n\nUnprocessing (or, more generally, postprocessing) does not consider the features, only the scores of the underlying predictor. If the underlying predictor does not sensibly map features to the target variable, then postprocessing that predictor will expectedly have very poor results. For this reason, to unconfound our results with the performance of the base model, we pick the predictor whose scores can achieve the highest accuracy ($m^*$).\n\n> (...) I am not sure how to understand the relation between unprocessing and postprocessing.\n> \n> (...) provide a clear characterization of the relation between unprocessing and such definition of postprocessing, so that readers can understand why unprocessing is a helpful analyzing tool to understand the importance of postprocessing.\n\nThe proposed postprocessing method is solely a more general version of the method of Hardt et al. (2016) that is now compatible with relaxed fairness constraint fulfillment. We call _unprocessing_ to the specific case of postprocessing where the fairness constraint was infinitely relaxed, $r=+\\infty$. That is, unprocessing boils down to minimizing each group\'s loss over each independent group threshold (finding which point in the group\'s ROC achieves minimal loss).\n\nStrict postprocessing will map an *unconstrained* score-based predictor to a *fairness-constrained* classifier. We use the term ""unprocessing"" to intuitevely capture the reverse procedure: mapping a *constrained* score-based predictor to a *fairness-unconstrained* classifier. Of course, either procedure can be applied to any predictor, constrained or unconstrained alike, but applying unprocessing to an unconstrained predictor will expectedly not significantly change its accuracy/fairness (discussed in the last paragraph of Sec. 2.2).\n\nTo clarify with an example: given a standard unconstrained classifier (e.g., GBM), strict postprocessing will map it to the fairness-accuracy space of constrained classifiers (e.g., FairGBM); on the other hand, given a constrained classifier such as FairGBM, _unprocessing_ will do the inverse mapping, outputting a classifier that will approximately sit in the fairness-accuracy space of unconstrained GBM models.\n\nWe have added a **new Appendix A.6** with detailed comparisons between unprocessed models that were trained in a fairness-constrained manner, and standard unconstrained models; as well as comparisons between postprocessed models that were trained in an unconstrained manner and inprocessing fairness-constrained models.\nHopefully this will further clarify the motivation behind unprocessing and postprocessing.\n\n---\n\nThank you for your feedback.

Such procedure is _oblivious_, in the sense that only the joint distribution $(A, Y, \\hat{Y})$ are utilized in the postprocessing procedure.

How significant is a 10% regret and is there any more expensive way to close that gap when using this approach?**\n\nWe would like to point the reviewer to Appendix A1, where we describe how the normalised regret is calculated. The reviewer is correct in understanding that $y_{max}$ and $y_{min}$ are provided by the Meta-Album datasets. If the values were not provided, one could calculate the values from the runs done on the study, as the reviewer has intuitively noted. In both scenarios, we can get access to $y_{max}$ and $y_{min}$.\n\nA 10% regret means the configuration has a distance of 0.1 to the oracle configuration, based on the range of the task. \n\nAs an example on why we use normalized regret,  suppose we are given two tasks A and B, and a method $f$:\n\nLet us assume we are using error rate, and we have the worst value in A of 0.75 and the best value 0.7. Let us assume our method $f$ finds hyperparameter configuration $\\lambda$ during optimization that has a value of 0.725.\n\nNow suppose that for task B, we have a worst value of 1 and a best value of 0.5.

However, observing the scale, our performance is located in the middle of the range of performances for task A. While, for task B, our performance is located in the 0.2 quantile. To overcome the aforementioned scenario, we use the normalization.\n\nLastly, we would like to point out that reporting the normalized performance is a common practice in the domain [1][2][3].\n\n[1] Kadra, A., Janowski, M., Wistuba, M., & Grabocka, J.

It is hard to predict if quick-tune always beats them or if that story changes as the wallclock time gets extended. It would be interesting to see if the search approaches regret 0 or stays ~10% above it. How do the curves in figure 3 look like when the wallclock time gets extended?**\n\nWe would like to point the reviewer to Figure 8 in the Appendix, which provides results for QuickTune on an extended runtime on all benchmarks. As can be observed by the results, the regret does not plateau at ~10% but keeps improving with time and it approaches 0. Additionally, we believe that Quicktune not only achieves a better final performance compared to the other methods, but it also achieves better anytime performance which is important for practitioners.\n\n3. **One issue with model selection in particular with small datasets is overfitting, including to the validation set.

Regarding overfitting, our search space features varying fine-tuning strategies that are used to combat overfitting such as SP- regularization, Delta Regularization, and BSS-regularization. Moreover, we apply different data augmentation methods (mixup, cutmix) and various regularization techniques.\n\nFor a more detailed description of our search space, we refer the reviewer to Section B.2 in the appendix.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer omMr'}, 'comment': {'value': 'Dear reviewer,\n\nthank you for the feedback.

An essential aspect is accurately estimating the carbon impact of emerging LLMs even before their training, which heavily relies on GPU usage. Existing studies have reported the carbon footprint of LLM training, but only one tool, mlco2, can predict the carbon footprint of new neural networks prior to physical training. However, mlco2 has several serious limitations. It cannot extend its estimation to dense or mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs, disregards critical architectural parameters, focuses solely on GPUs, and cannot model embodied carbon footprints. Addressing these gaps, we introduce \textit{\carb}, an end-to-end carbon footprint projection model designed for both dense and MoE LLMs. Compared to mlco2, \carb~significantly enhances the accuracy of carbon footprint estimations for various LLMs. The source code is released at \url{https://github.com/SotaroKaneda/MLCarbon}.",Oral 6B,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=aIok3ZD9to,https://openreview.net/forum?id=aIok3ZD9to,aIok3ZD9to,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': ""This paper describes a set of techniques for analyzing the carbon footprint of LLMs. The paper is remarkably thorough in both the model and the case studies.

The procedure of how LLMCarborn figures out the optimal parallelism is not quite clear. For figuring out the optimal parallelism strategy using LLMCarborn, how different are the strategies returned by LLMCarborn compared to the one solved using the compilation approach, e.g., the one proposed in [1]? [1] https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi22-zheng-lianmin.pdf\n \nThe primary objective of modeling optimal parallelism in LLMCarbon is to calculate the maximum hardware efficiency for a given combination of hardware and LLM configurations. Hardware efficiency plays a pivotal role in determining both the training duration (Equation 7) and the operational energy (Equation 8) of the system. It's noteworthy that whether LLMs are manually compiled [Narayanan et al., 2021] (Megatron-LM) or automatically compiled [1] on a specific hardware configuration, the maximum hardware efficiency remains constant. The validation of LLMCarbon's optimal parallelism modeling is carried out against the results obtained from manual compilation [Narayanan et al., 2021] (Megatron-LM). As indicated in Figure 7(a) in [1], the throughput achieved through automatic compilation is marginally lower than that achieved through the manual compilation technique (Megatron-LM).\n\nWe have revised the procedure explaining how LLMCarbon computes optimal parallelism. Please review the modified sections highlighted in blue in the PDF file. The central concept of optimal parallelism modeling involves the utilization of a polynomial regression model, trained using maximum hardware efficiency data from [Narayanan et al., 2021], to predict the maximum hardware efficiency based on LLM parameters. Each recorded maximum hardware efficiency value corresponds to an optimal number of computing devices (GPUs). Furthermore, LLMCarbon accommodates scenarios involving MoE LLMs and training with a fewer number of computing devices than the optimal configuration dictates.\n\n\n## 2. Instead of scaling law, recent LLM pre-training efforts usually leverage a certain training number of tokens, e.g.,1T/1.4T in LLaMA. Would it be sufficient to directly use the number of training tokens instead of loss/perplexity?\n\nIn brief, no. The scaling law takes into account not only the number of training tokens but also factors in the model's parameter count and the computational resources utilized during training. Relying solely on the number of training tokens allows us to address only a specific LLM architecture characterized by a predetermined parameter count.\n\n## 3. It is not clear how to use LLMCarborn to guide the design of future generations of LLM architectures and figure Accelerators. How can one use LLMCarborn to guide the designs of future generations of LLM architecture/training procedures or even AI hardware design?\n\nWe have presented four user case studies facilitated by LLMCarbon in Section 6. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 8, designers can evaluate the carbon footprints and test loss of various prospective LLM architectures to determine potential candidates for future development. Furthermore, by referring to Figure 7, hardware designers can ascertain whether a new generation of TPUs will lead to a reduction or increase in the training carbon footprint of state-of-the-art LLMs.\n\n## 4. The relationships and connections between the proposed hardware efficiency and metrics like arithmetic intensity and MFU are not clear.\n\nWhen the architecture of an LLM is fixed, the concept of hardware efficiency pertains to the extent of inactivity exhibited by computational devices, such as GPUs, during the training process of the LLM. This measurement allows LLMCarbon to make estimations regarding the duration of the training process (as specified in Equation 7), as well as the mean energy consumption of these computational devices throughout the LLM training (as elucidated in Equation 8), relying on the values of hardware efficiency. On the contrary, on the same hardware platform, the arithmetic intensity and MFU may be determined by the architecture of the LLM. Some architectures may involve higher arithmetic intensity, others may need a lower one. So the hardware efficiency and the arithmetic intensity are two totally different concepts.""}}, {'comment': {'value': '**Thank Reviewer KiRY for the careful and insightful review of our manuscript!**\n\n## 1. Some parameter is crucial to the final predicted results, the process of setting parameters should be clarified. For example, in equation 3, \\alpha, \\beta are the fitting parameters. However, the fitting dataset and fitting method are missing.\n\nWe have incorporated Equation 3 as presented in (Hoffmann et al., 2022). In the subsection titled ""Training Carbon Footprint Scaling"" within Section 6, we stated the following: "" To compute the test loss, we adopt the fitting constants including Î± = 0.34, Î² = 0.28, A = 406.4, B = 410.7, and E = 1.69 for Equation 3 from (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Since the test loss of an MoE LLM with P parameters is similar to that of its dense counterpart with only P/8 parameters (Rajbhandari et al., 2022), we decreased the P of MoE LLMs to P/8 in Equation 3.""\n\n## 2. Apart form the parameters discussed in the paper, more factors also affect the footprint. e.g., the parameter precision (fp16, int8, int4) and the implementation of kernel operation.\n\nOur objective is to establish a baseline framework capable of representing the carbon footprint associated with LLMs. It is noteworthy that, in the present study, we have not taken into account certain sophisticated algorithmic optimizations, including but not limited to speculative decoding, model distillation, and token pruning. Additionally, we have not incorporated advanced hardware enhancements such as aggressive quantization (utilizing formats like fp16, int8, and int4). We intend to explore the integration of these advanced features in our future work.\n\n## 3. There are not any text description about figure 3 and figure 4.\n\nWe have made textual alterations by introducing descriptive elements for Figure 3 and 4, which are delineated in blue text.\n\n## 4. The proposed LLMCarbon is somewhat like a system design with many prior experience from SOTA, the algorithm contribution are not notable.\n\nAs the size of LLMs continues to grow, the environmental impact in terms of carbon footprints becomes increasingly noteworthy. Consequently, the development of a precise tool for modeling the carbon footprints of LLMs is of paramount importance. The principal contribution of LLMCarbon lies in its pioneering capability to accurately characterize both the embodied and operational carbon footprints associated with LLMs. While LLMCarbon leverages established building blocks and incorporates previously published data for validation purposes, it is worth noting that prior research endeavors have not achieved the same level of precision in modeling both the embodied and operational carbon footprints of LLMs.'}}, {'comment': {'value': '**Thank Reviewer 5gUj for the careful and insightful review of our manuscript!**\n\n## 1. About the ""ground truth"" carbon footprint numbers and  not ""overfitting""?\n\nWithin Table 4, we have embraced the ""ground truth"" carbon footprint values of LLMs as reported by Google (Patterson et al., 2021) and Meta (Wu et al., 2022). It is our contention that these cloud service providers have conducted comprehensive assessments of the operational energy consumption associated with their hardware infrastructures during LLM training. Subsequently, they have employed specific equations, such as Equation 10 and Equation 11 presented in this study, to derive estimates for the operational carbon footprint values. In contrast, we introduce Equations 1 through 9, which serve as a direct means of modeling the operational energy consumption of their computational devices during LLM training. We have then employed their publicly available data to validate the predictions generated by our equations. In the context of Table 4, we have utilized the same LLMCarbon framework to forecast the operational carbon footprint of various LLMs. The results of our validation process reveal a maximum difference of +8.2% between the predicted carbon footprint and the previously published data.\n\n\n## 2. It is difficult to separate the contributions of the paper from the prior works.\n\nWith the continuous expansion in the scale of LLMs, the ecological ramifications concerning carbon footprints have gained heightened significance. The distinctive contribution of LLMCarbon resides in its pioneering endeavor, presenting the inaugural tool capable of meticulously modeling both the operational and embodied carbon footprints associated with an LLM. It is pertinent to emphasize that, heretofore, no prior research has achieved this level of proficiency. While our approach incorporates certain foundational building blocks derived from prior research and relies on previously published data for the validation of LLMCarbon, it is paramount to acknowledge that no prior work has demonstrated the capacity to model the carbon footprint of LLMs, let alone attaining the precision level exhibited by LLMCarbon.\n\n## 3. There is no measure of utility of an LLM.\n\nWe have employed the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) (Hoffmann et al., 2022) to formulate the representation of an LLM\'s test loss, as exemplified in Equation 3. Within the framework of LLMCarbon, we have the capacity to model scenarios in which the reduction of an LLM\'s carbon footprint is attainable through an increase in its test loss. As depicted in Figure 8, it is observable that the adoption of a smaller LLM, characterized by a reduced parameter count, can effectively diminish the carbon footprint. Nevertheless, this reduction in carbon footprint is accompanied by an associated increase in the test loss of the smaller LLM. However, now LLMCarbon cannot support the modeling of the accuracy of an LLM adopted in various downstream tasks.\n\n## 4.\tIt would be good to discuss the utility of the measurement tool. Is the expectation that model designers pick an appropriate data center, architecture, or training dataset to use based on carbon footprint? \n\nIn Section 6 of our work, we have presented a comprehensive analysis encompassing four distinct user case studies, each elucidating the utility of our LLMCarbon tool. These four case studies are as follows:\n1. Impact of Renewable Energy Adoption in Data Centers: We examine the effect of incorporating renewable energy sources within data centers on the carbon footprint of LLMs.\n2. Optimal Parallelism Settings in LLM Training: This case study delves into the ramifications of adopting optimal parallelism settings during the training process of LLMs, particularly with regard to their carbon footprint.\n3. Adoption of New Hardware Accelerators (TPUv3 and TPUv4): The investigation focuses on the implications of integrating advanced hardware accelerators, specifically TPUv3 and TPUv4, across all phases of LLM processing.\n4. Training Carbon Footprint Scaling Across Various LLMs: We explore the concept of Training Carbon Footprint Scaling across different LLMs, shedding light on the interplay between the carbon footprint, test loss, and LLM parameter count (architecture).\n\nWhile it is notable that we have not included a user case study explicitly examining the impact of data centers, LLM architectures, and datasets on the carbon footprint of an LLM, it is essential to highlight that our first user case study 1 partially underscores the significance of selecting environmentally sustainable data centers. Moreover, our fourth user case study elucidates the trade-off dynamics involving the LLM\'s carbon footprint, test loss, and LLM parameter count (architecture). Lastly, our third user case study provides insight into the embodied footprint of an LLM, offering designers the option to make adjustments by choosing between TPUs and GPUs for LLM training.'}}, {'comment': {'value': ""**Thank Reviewer pKfr for the careful and insightful review of our manuscript!**\n\n## 1. Not clear where the carbon coefficient factors in the model formulation. It seems to me that the authorâs definition of embodied carbon is the carbon emitted during the production of the hardware on which LLM models run. If that is the case, why? Because that hardware is not just used for running LLM workloads; it is. probably used for running other workloads as well. \n\nWe have adopted the definition of the embodied carbon footprint for machine learning models as delineated (Wu et al., 2022) and (Tannu & Nair, 2022). The embodied carbon footprint quantifies the quantity of carbon emissions generated during the manufacturing of the hardware, subsequently multiplied by the processing duration of an LLM. This resultant value is then divided by the overall lifespan of the hardware. It is important to acknowledge that the hardware infrastructure within data centers serves not only the processing needs of LLMs but also supports various other computational workloads. This consideration has been duly taken into account in our analysis. In Table 5, it is evident that the training latency associated with Meta XLM accounts for a mere 1.12% of the total projected lifespan of the hardware upon which it operates. We have made the assumption that the hardware is designed to endure for a period of 5 years. Furthermore, our Equation 12 underscores the intrinsic relationship between the processing duration of an LLM and the anticipated lifespan of the hardware hosting the LLM.\n\n## 2. It is not immediately evident to me how carbon (emission) factor is accounted for in this modeling. In principle, this coefficient is location dependent and consequently depending on where you are ruining your LLMs, you should get a different carbon footprint. Can the authors clarify that?\n\nThe reviewer's observation regarding the dependency of the coefficient on geographical location, and consequently, on the location where LLMs are operated, is indeed accurate. The influence of the data center's location is explicitly accounted for through the incorporation of Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and carbon intensity in Equation 9 and Equation 10. It is worth noting that distinct data centers exhibit varying values for both Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), as expounded upon by Henderson et al. (2020), and carbon intensity. PUE is a metric defined as the ratio of the overall energy consumption of a data center, encompassing all ancillary components such as cooling, to the energy consumed exclusively by the computing hardware housed within the data center. On the other hand, carbon intensity serves as a metric that evaluates the environmental impact stemming from the energy consumption of a data center. In Table 4, one can discern the disparities in CO2eq/KWh and PUE values across different data centers, underscoring the significance of geographical location in determining these metrics.\n\n## 3. While I appreciate the importance of carbon modeling of LLMs, it is not clear from this work i) whether the paper is relevant to ICLR as it does not address any core topic in learning, and ii) how it can be used for optimization purposes.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate the reviewer's acknowledgment of the significant role that sustainability plays in the development LLMs. Our LLMCarbon tool represents a pioneering effort in accurately modeling both the operational and embodied carbon footprints of LLMs, a facet of research that undeniably aligns with the core themes of societal considerations at ICLR.\n\nIn Section 6 of our manuscript, we have meticulously presented an extensive analysis comprising four distinct user case studies, each serving to elucidate the valuable applications of our LLMCarbon tool. These case studies serve as exemplary instances of how LLMCarbon can be effectively employed for optimization purposes. The four case studies are as follows:\n1. Impact of Renewable Energy Adoption in Data Centers: Within this context, we thoroughly investigate the impact of incorporating renewable energy sources into data centers, specifically in relation to their influence on the carbon footprint of LLMs.\n2. Optimal Parallelism Settings in LLM Training: This case study offers an in-depth exploration of the consequences associated with the adoption of optimal parallelism settings during the training of LLMs, with a particular focus on their carbon footprint implications.\n3.

The mixture of expert models seems to use regular scaling laws equations for performance prediction. More appropriate would be to use the equations from the routed scaling laws paper.\n\nThe reviewer\'s observation regarding the scaling behavior of MoE LLMs is indeed valid. We have noted that MoE LLMs exhibit scaling patterns distinct from those of dense LLMs. However, in the context of the ""Training Carbon Footprint Scaling"" subsection within Section 6, when comparing MoE and dense LLMs, we have employed the same scaling law for both MoE and dense LLMs. Considering that the test loss of an MoE LLM with P parameters closely resembles that of its dense counterpart with only P/8 parameters, as demonstrated by Rajbhandari et al. (2022), we have opted to adjust the value of P for MoE LLMs to P/8 within Equation 3. We acknowledge the need to refine this approach and employ routed scaling laws to enhance the accuracy of modeling MoE LLMs in future iterations of our work.\n\n\n## 2. Some factors are not very well discussed. For example, experimentation can have a large variance of CO2eq used. For deployment, more experimentation is usually undertaken to improve model efficiency through speculative decoding and distillation. A short discussion on the most CO2eq intensive factors and how they might differ between companies/institutions would be appropriate (no need to model this).\n\nOur primary aim is to establish a baseline framework with the capacity to delineate the carbon footprint attributed to LLMs. It is essential to underscore that the current investigation does not encompass certain intricate algorithmic optimizations, including but not limited to speculative decoding, model distillation, and token pruning. Furthermore, we have refrained from incorporating advanced hardware enhancements, such as aggressive quantization techniques (utilizing formats such as fp16, int8, and int4). Our intention is to delve into the integration of these advanced features in our forthcoming research endeavors. We will add a short discussion on the most CO2eq intensive factors and how they might differ between institutions in the next version of this manuscript.\n\n\n## 3. Why do you use 16 A100s, batch size 32 and 128 tokens for inference benchmarking? I would assume the most common deployment strategies for inference are (1) 8x A100 + NVSwitch with batch size of 64-128 for token-by-token generation and (2) personal deployment with batch size 1 (this can be significant for T5 and other open source LLMswhich enjoy large widespreadnn use)\n\nThe rationale behind our utilization of 16 A100 GPUs, a batch size of 32, and a token count of 128 for conducting inferences resides in the imperative requirement to validate the LLM inference phase using LLMCarbon. The validation data is sourced from (Yu et al., 2022), where these specific configurationsânamely, 16 A100 GPUs, batch size 32, and 128 tokensâwere employed. It is paramount for us to replicate these configurations in their entirety to ensure the fidelity of the inference carbon footprint generated for the purpose of validating LLMCarbon.'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'This paper introduces LLMCarbon, a comprehensive cost model developed to estimate the carbon footprint associated with various stages of LLM computation, such as training, inference, experimentation, and storage.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using only the downstream task data , leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining.

Our training setup, as listed in appendix B.1, was pretraining for either 200 epochs or 24h, first of the two, and finetuning similarly. The only exceptions are PathX and Speech Commands with Transformers, pretrained for 24h and finetuned for up to 5 days. **In the updated revision, we clearly refer to the relevant appendix for compute details** for better clarity.\n\nThe computational overhead of SPT has 2 aspects. First is possible undertraining while training from scratch, on the vast majority of the tasks we have validated that training accuracy is almost 100% and validation performance no longer increases for multiple epochs, **which is explicitly mentioned in paragraph 5 page 5, section 3.2 in the updated revision**. Rare exceptions are (1) runs where training performance stopped improving or did not improve at all, e.g. on PathX, (2) when the hyperparameter search led to undertrained model performing better on the validation set.  Hence, **training from scratch for longer will not improve performance on the downstream task**, as the issue is generalization rather than optimization.  \n\nThe 2nd aspect is **evaluation in a compute-tied setting**, in the revised version we **added a study in appendix D** of SPT against training from scratch in which the **total number epochs** is fixed, and the epochs allocated to SPT and finetuning are varied. Our results show the benefits of SPT are robust to a setting of restricted compute, for S4 and Transformers alike. Furthermore, the results show a small fraction of epochs for SPT suffices for significant performance gains, pointing to fast optimization of the pretraining objective, this subject is further analyzed showing SPT both optimizes fast, reaching close to peak performance early in training, and leads to faster optimization on the downstream task compared to the trained from scratch model. **An additional paragraph is added to the end of section 3.2 in page 5, highlighting the results in the appendix and the additional experiments.**\n\n## Comparison of SPT and trained from scratch (TFS) models in a compute-tied setting\nTotal number of epochs across SPT and finetuning is fixed and the ratio of epochs dedicated to SPT is varied.

The reviewer raised several questions which we address in order:\n1. ```The paper does not seem to take the cost of SPT vs training directly on the downstream task into account, or at least does not make this axis of comparison clear.```: This question was raised by all reviewers - please see our unified response above. \n2. ```It is stated in Section 3.2 that sub-par LRA performance is often cited as a prime motivating factor for new methods, but it seems efficiency is often just as important a reason new methods are proposed```: We agree that SSMs and transformer variants augmented with SSMs are typically more efficient in terms of compute compared to vanilla transformers and **have stated this point on Page 5, para 4**. \n3. ```...it still seems the structured biases are helping and the traditional procedure is somewhat predictive of the ordering. Or is this just an artifact of the experiments? A potential discussion on this point could be useful.```: We agree with the reviewer that those indeed help and SPT does not render them redundant. Our goal in section 3.3 was to address this exact issue in a controlled setting, evaluating the structured biases in S4, since a comparison directly with Transformers is difficult due to the large differences between models. In the revised version, we included possible implications of different inductive bias between S4 and Transformers as a possible explanation for the remaining gap, mentioned in the beginning of section 3.3, 1st paragraph of page 6. \n4. ```Table 1 lists many efficient attention methods that were originally evaluated on LRA. It would have been interesting to see a couple of these methods also trained with SPT to confirm empirically that they also do not perform as poorly when using SPT...```: The purpose of our work was to re-examine the common evaluation pipeline for popular long range benchmarks & therefore we chose to focus on widely adopted models and how performance gaps between them change when SPT is incorporated. While we agree this is an interesting point, efficient attention methods are not as widely-used as vanilla attention and hence we leave their evaluation as future work.\n5. ```The tasks considered in this paper are standard, but nonetheless the addition of less synthetic or larger scale tasks and experiments would also make the paper more compelling to a broader audience```: We agree that to prove the efficiency of SPT in general (rather than only on long sequence tasks) a larger study is in order. In the introduction, 1st paragraph page 2, we cite Krishna et al [1], El-Nouby et al [2] that provide such an analysis on standard NLP and Vision tasks respectively, with further details in the related work section. Along with our work, a large number of tasks and modalities demonstrate the efficacy of SPT. Since we observed training from scratch is widespread when evaluating long range sequence models, we focused on these types of tasks and provide a thorough investigation of SPT and its benefits in that context, and how it leads to a more modern evaluation scheme. \n6. ```No code appears to be included ...```: We **have added the link to the codebase** made available through the anonymized link at the end of the introduction in page 3.\n7. ```In Table 2, was the Transformer + Rotary embeddings trained without SPT? This seems unlikely. Perhaps there is a typo in the description of the Transformer methods in this table?```: In Table 2 the first line (Transformer + Rotary) is indeed trained from scratch, the difference between this model and in Table 1 is the use of Rotary embeddings, as well as the larger model size for several tasks.\n8. ```In Table 2, the X ""denotes computationally infeasible or unreported results. These are 2 drastically different things and 2 separate symbols should probably be used.```: As per your suggestion we **have fixed** this in the revised version.\n9. ```The methods evaluated for Figure 2 still seem to use complex valued parameterizations even though they are randomly initialized. Is this still necessary when using SPT? Since complex values can be problematic when scaling large scale systems, it would be interesting if SPT also removed the need for this in SSMs/linear RNNs.```: We agree with the reviewer this is an interesting experiment, but leave it for future work.\n\n[1] Kundan Krishna, Saurabh Garg, Jeffrey Bigham, and Zachary Lipton. âDownstream datasets make surprisingly good pretraining corporaâ.  \n[2] Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Gautier Izacard, Hugo Touvron, Ivan Laptev, Herv  Ìe Jegou, and Edouard Grave.

The reviewer raises several important questions that we address in order:\n1. ```Self-training may be effective not only across the data scale but also the model size```: This observation indeed aligns with our reported results. Our experiments show that original model sizes used in LRA visual tasks (Image, Pathfinder, PathX) are too small for high performance (Table 1) which led us to scale up the model sizes (Table 2), as mentioned in the 1st paragraph of page 5, section 3.2. To further investigate this, **we plan on adding a scaling experiment as suggested in the next revision**, comparing performance across model sizes for SPT and trained from scratch models.\n2. ```Would SPADE+SPT or MEGA+SPT further improve the performance? Is there a reason this comparison is not included in the paper?```: The reported results for hybrid models indeed outperform SPT variants, in our work we focus on transformers and S4 as they seem to be the most widely-used. We note that we did try training MEGA from scratch but were unable to reproduce the reported results. \n3. ```The current results are meaningless since the downstream task datasets are very different from Pythia 70M. I'm not sure we are able to find the right dataset to cover all the tasks for Long Range Arena. What about separating this experiment from Long Range Arena and showing the comparison for another downstream task on the language domain?```: The purpose of Pythia experiment is to see if pretraining on text is helpful on LRA, as has been observed on various modalities such as molecular data, tabular data, code and speech [1,2,3]. The issue of finding a unifying dataset that can be used for pretraining across modalities seen in LRA is indeed difficult, as mentioned by the reviewer, and we view SPT as a remedy for it.  For text-based tasks specifically, the question of evaluating the effectiveness of SPT vs. pretraining on large text corpora is discussed thoroughly in Krishna et. al. [4], showing that in many cases SPT rivals PT on large corpora as mentioned both in the 1st paragraph of page 2, and the related work section. Due to their comprehensive analysis, we focused on SPT in the context of evaluating models on long-range benchmarks. Nonetheless, for a more reliable comparison **we have added an additional baseline of **Pythia with random initialization** in the revision**, denoted as Pythia 70M (Rand Init), and **expanded the discussion in section 3.5** following these addition.  The randomly initialized baseline from which clearly shows the benefits of text pretraining are more easily observed. Yet in some cases, the pretrained model fails to significantly outperform the randomly initialized model, unlike SPT, which provides benefits across the board.\n4. ```Are S4/Transformers trained with the same number of epochs as S4+SPT/Transformers+SPT```: This question was raised by all reviewers - please see our unified response above.\n\n[1] Igor Melnyk, Vijil Chenthamarakshan, Pin-Yu Chen, Payel Das, Amit Dhurandhar, Inkit Padhi, Devleena Das, Reprogramming Pretrained Language Models for Antibody Sequence Infilling.  \n[2] Herzig et al., TAPAS: Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via Pre-training.  \n[3] Ao et al., SpeechT5: Unified-Modal Encoder-Decoder Pre-Training for Spoken Language Processing.  \n[4] Kundan Krishna, Saurabh Garg, Jeffrey Bigham, and Zachary Lipton. âDownstream datasets make surprisingly good pretraining corporaâ.""}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We are encouraged to hear that the reviewer found our work to be thorough and our method effective.

We could not fit a single sample on PathX-256 (input length 65K) on our 24GB GPU with Transformer with chunked attention and therefore could not evaluate them at all. We have **modified the notation** in Table 2 to clarify the difference between setups that are computationally infeasible and unreported results.\n3. ```What is the point of the experiment with Pythia?...```: We thank the reviewer for pointing to the lack of clarity in the Pythia section. It is common practice in various areas of ML to take LLMs pretrained on text and directly adapt them to other modalities such as molecular data, tabular data, code and speech - researchers have reported significant benefits from this approach [1, 2, 3]. In the Pythia experiments, we wanted to examine if pretraining on a large text corpus would result in large gains on LRA or whether maintaining the modality between PT and FT tasks is important. We agree that comparing the Pythia results to the available Transformer results makes comparison difficult due to different architecture and model sizes. Therefore, in the revised version, **we have added an additional baseline of Pythia with random initialization**, denoted as Pythia 70M (Rand Init) and indeed observe benefits from pretraining on text, yet not on all tasks, which shows the importance of SPT leading to to better performance across the entire suite.\n\n[1] Igor Melnyk, Vijil Chenthamarakshan, Pin-Yu Chen, Payel Das, Amit Dhurandhar, Inkit Padhi, Devleena Das, Reprogramming Pretrained Language Models for Antibody Sequence Infilling.  \n[2] Herzig et al., TAPAS: Weakly Supervised Table Parsing via Pre-training.  \n[3] Ao et al., SpeechT5: Unified-Modal Encoder-Decoder Pre-Training for\nSpoken Language Processing.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for the supportive review and address the raised weakness and questions as follows:\n1. ```SPT computational costs relative to initializations of state space models```: This question was raised by all reviewers - please see our unified response above.\n2. ```... on what scale of data SPT ends up resulting in poor initializations that the ones used in state space models``` :  We clarify that the plots in Figure 3 show **relative gains** offered by SPT over trained from scratch baseline and for performing SPT standard S4 initialization was used. At extremely low data regimes (0.5% of the original data), the absolute model performance after finetuning on the downstream task is low and hence the relative gain offered by SPT is not significant - however it is not negative, i.e., **not inferior to the trained from-scratch baseline**. 0.5% of the original data amounts to 225 samples for the Image task and 125 samples for the Text task. As a general guidance, when performance on the pretraining task itself approaches random accuracy on the validation set, we would expect SPT not to be beneficial, but even for 125 samples in Text task, pre-training accuracy is ~ 50% which is significantly higher than chance performance for character-level language modeling.

During the diffusion process, however, the reliance on rudimentary noise sampling techniques that do not preserve correlations present in subsequent frames of a video is detrimental to the quality of the results. This either produces high-frequency flickering, or texture-sticking artifacts that are not amenable to post-processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel method for preserving temporal correlations in a sequence of noise samples. This approach is materialized by a novel noise representation, dubbed $\int$-noise (integral noise), that reinterprets individual noise samples as a continuously integrated noise field: pixel values do not represent discrete values, but are rather the integral of an underlying infinite-resolution noise over the pixel area. Additionally, we propose a carefully tailored transport method that uses $\int$-noise to accurately advect noise samples over a sequence of frames, maximizing the correlation between different frames while also preserving the noise properties. Our results demonstrate that the proposed $\int$-noise can be used for a variety of tasks, such as video restoration, surrogate rendering, and conditional video generation.",Oral 6A,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=pzElnMrgSD,https://openreview.net/forum?id=pzElnMrgSD,pzElnMrgSD,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': 'This paper introduced a problem ""how to properly warp the Gaussian noise such that the warped noise map still has the Gaussian distribution preserved?"" and came up with a mathematically grounded solution.

We will address the remaining questions below.\n\n---\n\n**Zero-shot and training**\n\n>I guess most experiments in this paper are conducted in zero-shot way which applies the image processing model and method to video processing problems. Looking forward to seeing whether this helps when training a video model, like the PYoCo model.\n\nThis is correct, we propose our noise warping method primarily as a novel tool to improve temporal coherency of video editing tasks in a zero-shot setting. This is part of an effort to leverage pretrained image models for video tasks without requiring additional resource-intensive training of models on video datasets. However, as the reviewer mentioned, employing this temporally-correlated noise prior for training or fine-tuning video diffusion models is definitely an exciting direction for future work, and we will be happy to see adoption of our $\\int$-noise in these contexts.\n\n---\n\n**Comparison with video models**\n\n>Considering video restoration (Zeroscope Text-to-Video) and pose-to-human (dreampose) already have good performance, I wonder the gap between image model+ integrate noise and these video models.\n\nIn our work, we raised awareness on the importance of noise priors for temporal consistency and focused on solving the mathematical problem of distribution-preserving Gaussian noise warping. We then validated our proposed solution on several zero-shot video editing tasks with diffusion models, making it an effective tool for improving temporal coherency in these applications.\n\nWhile our proposed method is compatible with other zero-shot techniques like cross-frame attention (which we implemented in some of our results), it is challenging to directly compare our method alone with video models for several reasons. \n\nFirst, as many previous work on zero-shot video editing with image diffusion models have shown, it is often necessary to combine different techniques together to achieve good temporal coherency. For instance, Pix2Video [1] uses a combination of DDIM inversion, loss guidance and depth conditioning in their pipeline. A fair comparison against existing video models would have to be task-specific (super-resolution, stylization, video generation etc.), as different works adopt different pipelines. Our approach is a general method to enforce noise priors for diffusion models, and could be easily incorporated into different pipelines. \n\nSecondly, a comparison with these video models requires at least similar inputs to be fair. In the example of pose-to-person, Dreampose [2] is trained to take a very informative DensePose [3] parameterization as input, while we based our method on PIDM which only takes an Openpose poses [4]. Note that we did additionally use DensePose in our application results, but only for motion estimation (see Appendix D.3).  \n\nAll in all, we believe combining our $\\int$-noise with other techniques like depth conditioning can further improve the quality of the results.\n\nOn another note, we have added more visual comparisons of our methods with other noise priors such as Control-A-Video and DDIM inversion, which we believe can be helpful. Please refer to the new project webpage for additional results: https://warpyournoise.github.io/ \n\n---\n\n**Integration with DeepFloyd IF**\n\n>I wonder if this is applicable to other pixel-level diffusion models like the open-sourced deepfloyd from stabilityAI, whose capacity is comparable or better than stable diffusion.\n\nOur noise warping method is also applicable to other non-latent diffusion models like DeepFloyd from StabilityAI. We added some examples of using our noise warping with the open-source model for the task of video super-resolution and stylization to support our claim. The results can be visualized on our project webpage: https://warpyournoise.github.io/#deepfloyd We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, as this broadens the generalization abilities of our method beyond the category specific models we showcased in our initial manuscript.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion / References**\n\nWe hope this clarified some of the interrogations.

Video SR task). Haven\'t the authors considered a small modification of bilinear interpolation which is able to preserve the variance of pixels, namely, replacing the commonly used weighting coefficients with their square roots? Probably, this simple modification can even further improve its performance.\n\nWe have indeed considered the exact same modification in our early experiments! It seemed like a very simple idea for solving our problem, but the experiments revealed some issues with this method:\n* First, this averaging will only preserve the variance if it averages samples that are independent. This means we cannot simply warp from the previous frame as in standard bilinear interpolation. Rather, we have to go back to the first frame as in our proposed method.\n* Second, even by doing so, such a variance-preserving bilinear interpolation would still create correlations between neighboring pixels in the warped noise. This translates to some loss of high frequency details. Therefore, while it preserves the variance, it does not preserve the independence of the pixels.\n* Lastly, we tried using these in diffusion models. And because the noise has less high frequency but still has unit variance, the diffusion model is unable to denoise it properly. This leads to even worse artifacts than simple bilinear interpolation.\n\nWe included a visualization of the noise advected with the root-bilinear approach, which can be found at https://warpyournoise.github.io/#noise-comp. Additionally, we reported measurements of efficiency for this approach in our [answer to Reviewer 2 (3JNo)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pzElnMrgSD&noteId=nVUOv3C1dX).\n\n--- \n\n**Computational efficiency**\n\n> As mentioned above, the presented method is less computationally efficient than the baselines. It would be nice to provide a quantitative evaluation of that (in)efficiency.\n\nOur method is indeed computationally less efficient than most other noise prior methods. This is a known trade-off that we decided to make, as our intent was to solve Gaussian noise warping as accurately as we can to see how far that could bring us. Interestingly, it is still comparable to DDIM inversion in runtime. Additionally, our method has two parameters $k$ and $s$ which control the resolution of the upsampled noise and the discretization level of the pixel polygons respectively. These parameters provide users with the possibility to trade off accuracy in the temporal correlations with efficiency.\n\nPlease refer to our [answer to Reviewer 2 (3JNo)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pzElnMrgSD&noteId=nVUOv3C1dX) for further details regarding the methodâs efficiency. \n\n---\n\n**Warping of triangulation points**\n\n> From the manuscript, it is a bit unclear how the 9 triangulation points are warped in Fig. 1a. How exactly is the estimated optical flow which typically has the same resolution as the image itself, applied to non-integer pixel coordinates? In other words, how is the operation from Algorithm 2 implemented?\n\nFollowing standard practices in physics simulation of fluids, we warp the triangulation points by upsampling the flow map with bicubic interpolation. We will include this in the updated manuscript. \n\n---\n\n**Editing suggestions**\n\n> I suggest adding an explicit proof of why is a Gaussian vector (Appendix B.2). Probably, the shortest proof is the one considering the linear combinations for all possible, which are obviously Gaussian random variables.\n\nWe will integrate this into the updated manuscript.\n\n\n\n> I recommend adding more comments on how Eq. 24 for the continuous case turned into Eq. 5 for the discrete case. Why is it valid to still rely on the first-order approximation?\n\nIt is indeed an important aspect of our contribution, we will clarify this in a new section in the Appendix. Intuitively the discretization does not affect the theoretical guarantees because we are only approximating the true warped pixel polygon with a ""discretized"" one. But the set of all warped polygons still creates a partition of the domain, so all the guarantees on independence and variance preservation still hold. In a sense, our re-interpretation of noise as a continuous field allows us to transfer the error from value space (e.g. bilinear interpolation) to the geometrical representation of the domain (approximation on the shape of the polygon).\n\n--- \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe hope this clarified some of the interrogations.

We will address the weaknesses mentioned below. \n\n---\n\n**Treatment of non-diffeomorphic warping fields**\n\n>From the theoretical point of view, the presented approach relies on the warping field being a diffeomorphism, while in practice to the best of my knowledge optical flows estimated with off-the-shelf methods are rarely invertible mappings.\n\nIt is true that the theoretical derivation relies on the warping field being a diffeomorphism, which is generally not the case for optical flow maps. In particular, disocclusions can reveal empty spaces that arenât mapped to any part of the initial frame. \n\nWe solve this in practice by replacing missing values with newly sampled noise. On very long sequences, we also resample the high-resolution noise periodically, which effectively updates the anchor frame. We will add a more detailed explanation regarding how we handle warping in practical settings in the Appendix. \n\n--- \n\n**Image quality measure in quantitative evaluation**\n\n> According to Tab. 1, while the proposed method typically increases temporal coherence, at the same time it worsens frame-wise image plausibility metrics such as LPIPS or FID.\n\nFor the appearance transfer example, we used FID as a measure of image quality, since there is no ground truth in this case. FID is computed between the LSUN Bedroom dataset and a dataset we create from frames of the video results we have. Unfortunately, FID simultaneously measures sample quality and diversity, while we are only interested in quality. Since we are computing it over a sequence of frames from the same video, the diversity is naturally very low, which explains the overall high values we have in Tab. 1 (typical FID values are <50). Additionally, less temporally coherent methods like âRandom Noiseâ will likely have more variations between frames, which improves diversity. This explains why random noise performs the best wrt. FID, and our method typically performs a bit worse. All in all, the main take-away from the FID comparison is that our method performs in the same range as other Gaussian noise priors (random, fixed, PYoCo, Control-A-Video) and much better than the other interpolation methods. This, in complement with the warp error metric, shows that we are able to take the âbest of both worldsâ.\n\nRegarding the LPIPS metric for video super-resolution and restoration, we do observe a slight decrease in image quality according to the metrics, which we cannot fully explain. Similarly, the main take-away is that we are performing in the same range as the other noise priors methods, while having much better temporal coherency.\n\n--- \n\n**More comparisons with Control-A-Video**\n\n> None of the video samples in the supplementary except for fluid dynamics provides the results of noise handling with the method proposed by Control-A-Video model. Please note that this model more close to the presented method in spirit since it also takes input video into account while PYoCo does not.\n\nThe residual noise from Control-A-Video behaves like fixed noise in regions of uniform color, and like random noise around moving edges between objects. Our experiments have shown that this generally leads to the âworst of both worlds'', as both flickering and texture sticking happens. We have updated the results with more comparisons with the residual noise prior.

We will address the remaining questions below.\n\n---\n\n**Computational Efficiency**\n\n> The proposed method is computationally inefficient as compared to prior arts. Quantitative comparisons on this aspect would have been more helpful for future research works.\n\nWe estimate both wall time and CPU time for all methods on a video sequence from the surrogate rendering application (resolution at 256x256). By evaluating the run time for different sub-sequence lengths, we can linearly regress the average per frame computation time of each method. This is evaluated on a GeForce RTX 3090 GPU and an Intel i9-12900K CPU. The table below summarizes the run time of our method against previous approaches. We will add this table to the updated manuscript appendix.\n\n| Method | Wall Time (in ms/frame) | CPU Time (in ms/frame) |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Random | 0.01| 0.01|\n| Fixed | 0.01  | 0.01|\n| PYoCo (mixed) [1] | 0.01| 0.01 |\n| PYoCo (progressive) [1]  | 0.01| 0.01|\n| Control-A-Video [2]| 6.08   | 95.46|\n| Bilinear  | 5.26| 76.76|\n| Bicubic | 6.00| 87.73|\n| Nearest| 5.17| 75.73 |\n| Root-bilinear| 7.66 |103.78|\n| DDIM inversion (20 steps) [3] | 853.42 | 2226.6|\n| DDIM inversion (50 steps) [3] | 2125.5  | 3608.3 |\n| **$\\int$\ufeff-noise (ours, k=3, s=4)**| **981.76**| **2953.6**|\n\nOur method is indeed less efficient. This is a trade-off that we decided to make, as our intent was to solve Gaussian noise warping as accurately as possible, to understand how far that could bring us. It is worth noting that we have explored several simpler, less computationally heavy ways to warp the noise by making different simplifying assumptions (such as the root-bilinear interpolation methods shown in the table, a modification also suggested by Reviewer 3 (H5Nc) in Question 1). However, none of those led to satisfying solutions.\n\nAn analysis of the table shows that simple noise sampling methods like PYoCo, fixed or random noise can be executed efficiently on GPU. Methods that rely on information from the input sequence in a simple way such as Control-A-Video or interpolation methods are almost 3 orders of magnitude slower than the simple noise sampling methods. Finally, our warping method requires ~1s per frame to warp the noise. While being considerably less efficient than aforementioned methods, the proposed approach is comparable to DDIM inversion. With a standard setting of 50 DDIM steps, DDIM inversion takes longer than our method to produce a noise map, while being similar to ours in run time if we reduce the number of steps to 20. Please refer to our answer to Reviewer 1 (13WQ) for more qualitative comparisons with DDIM inversion.\n\n| k \\ s | 1| 2| 3| 4|\n| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |\n| **0**| 10.0 | 10.3| 10.7| 12.1 |\n| **1**| 10.1 | 10.5| 10.9| 12.2 |\n| **2**| 10.3 | 10.5| 10.9| 12.3 |\n| **3**| 12.2 | 12.5| 13.0| 14.2 |\n| **4**| 17.9 | 17.9 | 18.4  | 19.5 |\n\nAdditionally, our method has two parameters $k$ and $s$ which control the resolution of the upsampled noise and the discretization level of the pixel polygons respectively. These parameters provide users with the possibility to trade off accuracy in the temporal correlations against efficiency. We refer to the table above to demonstrate how the parameters impact the performance. The measurements represent the wall clock time in seconds that our method requires to compute noise for a video sequence of 24 frames at resolution 256x256. Additionally, we refer to the Section 4 of the paper on how these parameters affect the quality of the results. \n\nLastly, our implementation was not optimized for efficiency. We believe it can still be drastically improved, which would make the computational cost of using our noise scheduler negligible. \n\n---\n\n**Better visual comparison for fluid super-resolution**\n\n>Figure 5 illustration is hard to follow, itâs not clear how to judge the performance based on the images shown. \n\nUnfortunately it is hard to show video results properly on paper.

We will address the remaining questions below. \n\n---\n\n**Implicit assumption on temporally-coherent noises**\n\n> The major weakness from the practical point of view is the implicit assumption that temporally correlated noise maps can induce temporally consistent video editing results, which is often not true. \n\nWhile there is no theoretical guarantee that diffusion models produce temporally-consistent video editing results with a given temporally-correlated noise map, we observe that this is often the case in practice. Take the translating pizza example on Appendix E: if we add a noise that undergoes the same translation as the input video, the generated images are more temporally coherent. For better visualization and understanding of these results, we refer to the videos at https://warpyournoise.github.io/#warp-ldm. \n\nOther examples in the paper also highlight that transformations that are applied to the noise will produce similar image transformations, even though thatâs not explicitly enforced during training of diffusion models. With this in mind, we believe that our proposed temporally coherent noise would indeed improve the training of video diffusion models, similar to PYoCo [1]. \n\n--- \n\n**Sensitivity with respect to flow map**\n\n> Iâm wondering how sensitive the method is with respect to the underlying estimated flow map? In other words, how do the errors in the estimated optical flows affect the results?\n\nOverall, as one would expect, accurate optical flow is important for achieving good results. From our experiments, we observed that poorly estimated optical flow will still be able to warp the noise, but it tends to create visual artifacts in the form of temporal misalignment, i.e. fine details in the video will not seem to be perfectly synchronized with the motion of larger structures. \n\nThat being said, it is worth noting that the method is still relatively robust to small errors. For the video super-resolution and JPEG restoration task we show in the submission (Figure 4), the optical flow is computed on the degraded, low-resolution video, and our method is still able to produce decent, coherent results.\n\nLastly, as our noise warping method is agnostic to the way the deformation field is computed, it can also work with more robust methods such as Neural Layered Atlases [2], when flow-based methods struggle to provide accurate motion estimation. These methods map each pixel in each frame to a canonical space common to all frames. In this case, the canonical space is considered the âfirst frameâ and the mapping replaces the accumulated flow map in our algorithm. Please refer to our answer to Reviewer 3 for a more complete discussion about the properties of the warping velocity field. \n\n---\n\n**Comparison with DDIM inversion**\n\n> Iâm wondering how will the noise maps obtained [using DDIM inversion] compare to the ones obtained from the $\\int$-noise in terms of the final video quality?\n\nThe main issue that prevents a fair and straightforward comparison with DDIM inversion is that the latter only produces one single noise map per image, whereas the applications we show generally use DDPM and require as many noise maps as there are steps in the denoising process.\n\nWe included a new visual comparison for the bedroom SDEdit surrogate rendering results with DDIM noise inversion that can be visualized here: https://warpyournoise.github.io/#ddim. There are two ways we can think of to use DDIM inversion with SDEdit. \n* The first consists in partially inverting the image to an intermediate noisy version using DDIM inversion and denoising it with forward DDIM. This expectedly leads to a reconstruction of the input synthetic scene with no additional realistic details.\n* The second way consists in fully inverting each frame to obtain a set of noise maps, which we treat similarly to the other noise priors we compare to in the original submission. Since the synthetic renders we use as input video are far from the distribution of the LSUN dataset, the inverted noises are not Gaussian. Our results demonstrate this creates noticeable artifacts. \n\nLastly, DDIM inversion deterministically maps each frame to a noise, which removes any diversity in the results. In comparison, our method can apply the same warping to different noise maps to generate different equally temporally-consistent appearances.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion / References**\n\nWe hope this clarified some of the interrogations.

Recently, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been proposed for solving the $K$-means optimization problem, which enjoy strong statistical optimality guarantees. However, the prohibitive cost of implementing an SDP solver renders these guarantees inaccessible to practical datasets. In contrast, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a simple clustering algorithm widely used by machine learning practitioners, but it lacks a solid statistical underpinning and theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we consider an NMF-like algorithm that solves a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the SDP-relaxed $K$-means formulation using a nonconvex Burer--Monteiro factorization approach. The resulting algorithm is as simple and scalable as state-of-the-art NMF algorithms while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees as the SDP.

Our derivation relies on the fact that the optimum solutions of SDP and BM coincide under the separation assumption, which acts as the sufficient condition. Interestingly, in practice, we also observe linear convergence of BM even with small separation. Hence, we anticipate a similar derivation of convergence analysis under a weak separation assumption, which will be a focus of our future research. One main difficulty, however, lies in analyzing the SDP under partial recovery, for which a sharp bound does not currently exist in the literature to the best of our knowledge. We have incorporated this discussion in Appendix C of the revised document.\n\n> Regarding the theoretical results for other distributions:\n\nThat is a good point. The results of convergence analysis can be derived similarly for sub-Gaussian distributions, except that the separation condition would become weaker. The threshold of \nexact recovery for Gaussian distributions is based on the high dimensional concentration bounds __AND__ the rotation-invariance property of Gaussian. Therefore, similar threshold of \nexact recovery for sub-Gaussian distributions could be derived accordingly. However, we anticipate a larger separation condition for sub-Gaussian distributions as the high dimensional concentration bounds for sub-Gaussians might not as tight as the bounds for Gaussians. On the other hand, the noise level of sub-Gaussian distributions is higher than Gaussian distributions. Therefore, we need larger signal (separation) to cluster the distributions successfully.'}}, {'comment': {'value': '>Regarding the question ``the use of Algorithm 1 needs more discussion..."":\n\nThank you for the feedback. We have included a discussion on the choices of parameters in Appendix A in the revised version. Practically, we begin with a small $\\alpha = 10^{-6}$ and incrementally increase $\\alpha$ until reaching $\\alpha = 10^{-3}$. Similarly, we start with a small $\\beta = 1$ and increase $\\beta$ up to $\\beta = 10^3$. The second experiment demonstrates that the choice of $r$ does not significantly impact the convergence rate. However, in practice, we observed that $r=K$ results in many local minima for small separations. Therefore, we slightly increased $r$ and chose $r=2K$ for all applications, which provided desirable statistical performance, comparable to or slightly better than SDP.\n\nAfter obtaining the second-order locally optimal point $U$ in Algorithm 1 (BM), we apply a rounding procedure. This involves extracting the first $K$ eigenvectors of $U$ as columns of a new matrix $V$, and then using $K$-means to cluster the rows of $V$ for the final assignments. The same rounding procedure is also applied to the results from both SDP and NMF. The details of this rounding procedure have been added to Appendix A in the revision.\n\n>Regarding the question ``use of language can be improved..."":\n\nThank you for pointing out these issues. We have made necessary grammatical adjustments in the revision.\n\nFor the ``sharp threshold"", its formal definition is provided in Eq. (5). The rationale behind labeling it as a sharp threshold is explained in the discussion immediately following Eq. (5). In essence, if the minimal centroid-separation exceeds this threshold, the solution of the SDP formulation will, with high probability, perfectly recover the cluster partition structure. Conversely, if the minimal centroid-separation is below the threshold, the solution of SDP (as well as any other algorithm, regardless of computational complexity) will fail to recover the cluster partition.\n\nConcerning the ""manifold-like subset"", the definition of ""manifold-like subset $ \\Omega$"" is found in Eq. (8). The term ""manifold-like subset"" is used because $\\Omega$ is a subset of the sphere manifold. Additionally, the projection to $\\Omega$ shares similar properties with the projection to the sphere manifold, such as having a closed form under projection. Hence, we use ``manifold-like subset"" to describe its characteristics.\n\nFor the ``nonconvex approach"", this phrase emphasizes that the BurerâMonteiro (BM) method addresses nonconvex optimization problems, in contrast to SDP, which deals with convex optimization problems.\n\nConcerning the ``one-shot encoding"", thank you for highlighting the typo.

At a high level, our approach computes a solution for the same SDP formulation of $K$-means using a new scalable algorithm reminiscent of NMF. On one hand, our approach \'\'enjoys the same strong statistical optimality"" because it computes the same SDP solution as prior SDP approaches. On the other hand, each iteration of our proposed algorithm is essentially identical to NMF. Theorem 1 and our experiments establish that the algorithm rapidly converges to the SDP solution. Therefore, our proposed algorithm is indeed ``simple and scalable as state-of-the-art NMF"" for solving the SDP.\n\nAs mentioned in the last paragraph on page 6, the goal of our main theorem (Theorem 1) is ``to demonstrate that projected GD can efficiently solve the primal subproblem $\\min_{U\\in\\Omega} \\mathcal{L}_\\beta (U,y)$"", which exhibits rapid linear convergence locally. This fact, in conjunction with Prop. 1 (Existence and Quality of Primal Minimizer) and Prop. 2 (Linear Convergence of Dual Multipliers), indicates the local linear convergence of Algorithm 1. Here, our condition on initialization requires only a constant element-wise relative error bound.\n\nMoreover, the third plot in Figure 2 also indicates the linear convergence of our algorithm, as justified by our theoretical analysis. In this setting of large separation, the global optimums of the BM and SDP formulations align. Therefore, BM is superior compared to existing clustering methods in that it can achieve exact recovery like the SDP, while maintaining linear time complexity similar to KM, NMF, and SC. This fact is summarized in Figure 1 of the paper, where our algorithm achieves significantly smaller mis-clustering errors compared to existing state-of-the-art methods given the same CPU running time. Hence, we state in the abstract, ``The resulting algorithm is just as simple and scalable as state-of-the-art NMF algorithms, while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees as the SDP"", a claim supported by both theoretical analysis and numerical results.\n\n> Regarding the question ``there should be more discussion or comparison of computational complexity..."":\n\nIn Section 5, we compared the computational complexity and mis-clustering errors of our algorithm with existing clustering methods for Gaussian mixture models, as detailed in the paragraph ""Performance for BM for GMM"". This analysis considers small separation with sample sizes ranging from $n=400$ to $n=57,600$. The results are summarized in the first two plots of Figure 2. In the last few sentences of the discussion and comparison, we note that the mis-clustering error of SDP and BM coincides, while NMF, KM, and SC show large variance and are far from achieving exact recovery, as evident from the first plot of Figure 2. The second plot of Figure 2, as mentioned, ``indicates that SDP and SC have super-linear time complexity, while the log-scale curves of our BM approach, KM, and NMF are nearly parallel, indicating that they all achieve linear time complexity"".\n\nFurthermore, in our revised version (see Appendix B), we have added comparisons of CPU time costs and mis-clustering errors with increasing dimension $p$ or with increasing cluster number $K$ across different methods.

From the third plot in Figure 2, we observe that our BM approach achieves linear convergence in this setting. Additionally, the curves for $r = K$, $r = 2K$, and $r = 20K$ are closely aligned, suggesting that the choice of $r$ does not significantly impact the convergence rate under large (cluster) separation. Conversely, the theorem recommends a smaller step size $\\alpha$ and a larger augmentation parameter $\\beta$ for large sample sizes $n$. This guidance allows for the tuning of parameters for simple GMMs with small sample sizes, which can be adapted for applying BM to real datasets with varying sample sizes $n$.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'We thank you for your positive comments on our work and appreciate all your valuable comments.'}, 'comment': {'value': '> Regarding the discussion of practical limitations:\n\nThank you for pointing that out! In practice, when applying our algorithm to datasets with very small separations (signal-to-noise ratio), our algorithm, like SDP and NMF, may fail to yield informative clustering results. We anticipate that this issue could be addressed with the application of different rounding procedures. Specifically, for cases with small separation where the solutions to BM, SDP, and NMF no longer represent exact membership assignments, it becomes crucial to consider and compare different rounding processes to extract informative membership assignments. We intend to pursue this as a future research goal. Due to space limitations, we have included a discussion on this topic in Appendix C of the revised document.  \nRegarding computational aspects, unlike SDP, our algorithm (BM) can be solved in linear time with respect to sample size $n,$ where parallel computing can be applied to further enhance the computational efficiency. On the other hand, BM formulation (eq.(6)) keeps the matrix $A$ (contains the information of dataset) from the SDP formulation (eq.(4)), which indicates that BM can deal with the same data types as those for SDP. Therefore we can adapt our BM formulation to manifold data, measure-valued data, or data with heterogeneous covariance in the GMM context.\n\n> Regarding the initialization conditions:\n\nThanks for your advice. The initialization criteria mentioned in Theorem 1 is derived from Theorem 3 in Appendix D.3., which provides a more rigorous form of the initialization criteria.

This comparison considers small separation with sample sizes ranging from $n=400$ to $n=57,600$. The results, summarized in the first two plots of Figure 2, reveal that the mis-clustering error of SDP and BM coincides, while NMF, KM ($K$-means++, the fastest clustering algorithm scalable to large datasets), and SC show large variance and fall short of exact recovery, as depicted in the first plot of Figure 2. The second plot in Figure 2, as mentioned, indicates that SDP and SC exhibit super-linear time complexity, while the log-scale curves of our BM approach, KM, and NMF are nearly parallel, suggesting that they all achieve linear time complexity.\n\nFurthermore, we have added comparisons of CPU time costs and mis-clustering errors with increasing dimensions $p$ or increasing cluster numbers $K$ across different methods in Appendix B of the revised document.

Therefore, the computational cost with respect to $p$ should be of the order $O(p)$.\n\nFor the numerical experiments, we have added a plot in the revision (second plot of Figure 6 in Appendix B) showing comparisons of CPU time costs across different methods when $p=125,250,500,1000$. The corresponding table summarizing the results of mis-clustering errors is presented below. Here, we consider the setting the same as our second experiment ``Performance for BM for GMM"", except that now we consider a fixed sample size $n=2500$. SC is not considered as it would fail in high-dimensional cases in our experiments. From the table, we observe that the mis-clustering errors for both SDP and BM coincide and remain optimal as the dimension $p$ increases, while $K$-means++ shows large variance, and NMF fails when the dimension is as large as $p=1000$. The second plot in Figure 6 indicates that the log-scale curve for BM is nearly parallel to the log-scale curves for both KM and NMF. This suggests the same order of CPU time cost with respect to dimension $p$ for BM, KM, and NMF, which is nearly of order $O(p)$. Similar to the case when $K$ changes, the curve of computational time cost for SDP is relatively stable for different $p$, as the dominant term of computational complexity for SDP is the sample size $n$, which is of order $O(n^{3.5})$.

Our added simulation results suggest that the dependence of our runtime on $K$ appears to be of linear order $O(K)$, which is much better than $O(K^6)$ in our theoretical guarantee. To compare the CPU time costs and mis-clustering errors when the number of clusters increases across different methods, we did the comparisons of CPU time cost across different methods when $K=5,10,20,40,50$ in the revision. Under the same setting as our second experiment (``Performance for BM for GMM"") in Section 5, except that now we consider fixed sample size $n=1000$, dimension $p=50$. SC is not considered as it would fail for large $K$ in our experiments. The results are summarized in the first plot of Figure 6 in Appendix B in the revision, where we can observe that the log-scale curve of BM is nearly parallel to the log-scale curve of KM and NMF, indicating that the growth of CPU time cost for BM with respect to $K$ is reasonable (nearly $O(K)$) and would not achieve the loose upper bound $O(K^6)$ derived from the analysis. The curve of computational time cost for SDP is relatively stable for different $K$ since the dominant term of computational complexity for SDP is the sample size $n$, which is as large as the order $O(n^{3.5})$. More details can be found in Appendix B in the revision.\n\nOn the theoretical side, it is common to treat the cluster number $K$ as constant. Indeed, the best known theoretical guarantee for exact recovery via SDP necessarily requires a small value of $K=O(\\log(n)/\\log\\log(n))$. So the time complexity bound for our BM is at most $\\text{polylog}(n)$. It is a widely open conjecture whether a sharp threshold exists without a statistical--computational gap when $K \\gg \\log(n)$. For these reasons, we did not attempt to optimize the dependence on $K$ in the theory in our paper.\n\n> Regarding ``one-shot encoding"":\n\nThanks for pointing out. We have corrected it in the revision. \n\n> Regarding the selection of the rank $r$ in the algorithm:\n\nThe second numerical experiment in the paper demonstrates that the choice of $r$ does not significantly impact the convergence rate. Therefore, ideally, we would choose the rank $r$ as small as $r=K$. However, in practice, we found that $r=K$ results in many local minima for small separation. Consequently, we slightly increase $r$ and choose $r=2K$ for all applications, which provided overall good performance. More details regarding the choices of parameters have been added to Appendix A in the revision.\n\nIn real applications, the number of clusters $K$ might be unknown as well. In these situations, we can adopt some common methods recommended in the literature for $K$-means to choose $K$. For example, we may use the popular elbow method, which first runs fast clustering algorithms such as the $K$-means++ for a range of values of $k$ (number of clusters) and then plots the total within-cluster sum of square against $k$. After that, we may choose a smallest value of $k$ that maintains a relatively low sum of square of the distances.\n\n> Regarding the question ``In experiments, I am noticing that the misclustering error of SDP..."":\n\nThat is a valid point. On one hand, Table 1 shows that BM yields slightly better mis-clustering errors compared to SDP. However, the differences are not significant since the error bars for BM and SDP overlap. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that BM imposes a more stringent constraint, $U \\ge 0$, compared to SDP\'s constraint of $UU^T \\ge 0$.

As they are increasingly adopted for knowledge-intensive tasks, it becomes evident that these design choices lead to failures to generate factual, relevant, and up-to-date knowledge. To this end, we propose Knowledge Card, a modular framework to plug in new factual and relevant knowledge into general-purpose LLMs. We first introduce knowledge cards---specialized language models trained on corpora from specific domains and sources. Knowledge cards serve as parametric repositories that are selected at inference time to generate background knowledge for the base LLM. We then propose three content selectors to dynamically select and retain information in documents generated by knowledge cards, specifically controlling for relevance, brevity, and factuality of outputs. Finally, we propose two complementary integration approaches to augment the base LLM with the (relevant, factual) knowledge curated from the specialized LMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Knowledge Card achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets. Ultimately, Knowledge Card framework enables dynamic synthesis and updates of knowledge from diverse domains. Its modularity will ensure that relevant knowledge can be continuously updated through the collective efforts of the research community.",Oral 7B,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WbWtOYIzIK,https://openreview.net/forum?id=WbWtOYIzIK,WbWtOYIzIK,"[{'title': {'value': 'Paper Decision'}, 'decision': {'value': 'Accept (oral)'}, 'comment': {'value': ''}}, {'metareview': {'value': ""The paper under review introduces Knowledge Card, a framework for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with up-to-date factual knowledge from specialized language models called knowledge cards.

While we did not identify good resources to test out LLM knowledge abilities in a long-form generation setting thatâs fitting in this work, we believe that Knowledge Card would be better at knowledge generation tasks as well thanks to the modular knowledge cards and the two integration approaches. Our goal is to demonstrate the modular Knowledge Card approach works for knowledge-intensive understanding tasks, while future work can explore expanding it to generative tasks.\n\n> The bottom-up approach and top-down approach mentioned in the text each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Is it possible to combine the two?\n\nOne straightforward way to combine them would be: in each step of top-down, the LLM proposes multiple knowledge cards as candidates, then employ the bottom-up approach with the pool of these knowledge cards for knowledge generation. We conducted a quick exploration with this using the gpt-3.5-turbo LLM, finding out that âhaving LLMs propose multiple knowledge card candidatesâ would need more than just zero-shot prompting. Thank you for proposing this interesting idea. We would love to explore this in our future work.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author Response'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We would like to thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comments and feedback.\n\n> Language model based modules appear to entail potential risks. For example, knowledge cards based on a language model necessitate a retrieval-based factuality selector, and inaccuracies can arise in LLM-based yes/no decisions during the top-down knowledge integration process.\n\nWe agree that each step in Knowledge Card is not, and will never be, 100% accurate. However, we argue that the modular components in Knowledge Card could be seamlessly integrated with the future state-of-the-art and continuously improve. Thanks to the modularity of Knowledge Card, these errors and risks could be continuously mitigated with new factuality evaluation models, strategies for LLMs to abstain and seek information, and more.\n\n> One of the major differences between this work and existing work based on retrieval or generation is the utilization of knowledge cards from multiple domains. Therefore, it would be beneficial to demonstrate performance trends based on the gradual accumulation of knowledge cards or the level of granularity of knowledge cards.\n\nWe conduct new experiments to test out knowledge card accumulation with the misinformation dataset, 2-way setting, bottom-up approach, and the ChatGPT model. Starting from 0 knowledge cards (vanilla LLM), we add one knowledge card at a time and reevaluate performance.\n\n|        | vanilla | + PubMed | + IMDB | + BookCorpus | + News | + Wikipedia |\n|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:------:|:------------:|:------:|:-----------:|\n| # card |    0    |     1    |    2   |       3      |    4   |      5      |\n|  BAcc  |   80.1  |   80.7   |  80.6  |     82.3     |  85.7  |     86.5    |\n|   MaF  |   70.5  |   70.6   |  71.2  |     72.9     |  73.1  |     75.3    |\n\nIt is demonstrated that the addition of knowledge cards, especially in-domain ones (News in this case), is helpful in improving the base large language model.\n\n> In Table 1, 2, and 3, there are different performance trends among the three Knowledge Card variations. Do the authors speculate about the potential reasons behind these results?\n\nWe argue that the bottom-up and top-down settings of Knowledge Card have their respective pros and cons. While bottom-up is especially good at multi-domain knowledge synthesis and better works with documents spanning multiple knowledge domains, top-down is better at iterative and selective knowledge solicitation. Specifically:\n\nTask 1, MMLU: âtop-down generally outperforms bottom-up likely because MMLU contains math-related questions that do not necessitate external knowledge. This observation suggests that top-down\napproaches are better at tasks where external knowledge is not always necessary.â\n\nTask 2, misinformation: âbottom-up outperforms both variants of top-down, thanks to its methodology to jointly activate knowledge cards from various domains and enable multi-domain knowledge synthesis.â\n\nTask 3, MidtermQA: when there is a specific in-domain knowledge card for a given task, the top-down approach is better as it could accurately pinpoint which knowledge card is most needed.\n\nWe have included some of the explanations in the current paper and will include these empirical evidence of bottom-up and top-downâs pros and cons in Section 4 of the final version.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author Response (2/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': '> Can you elaborate more on how the MidtermQA dataset was curated?\n\nWe have included the full description of the curation of the MidtermQA dataset in Appendix E, *Dataset Details*. A brief overview:\n\n- We first collect the metadata, contestants, and outcomes of the 510 races in the 2022 US Midterm Election (Senate, House of Representatives, and Gubernatorial elections) with the help of Wikipedia.\n\n- We then construct three settings with these races: *open-book*, where LLMs directly answer with the name of the winner; *two-way*, where LLMs choose the winner from the two frontrunners; *four-way*, where LLMs two more candidates contesting in the same state, but different races, are added to create distractions.\n\n- This results in a total of 1530 questions for the MidtermQA dataset. The exact prompt and dataset format is presented in Table 7.\n\n> In bottom up approach (figure 1) how would a passage about ""San Mateo\'s senior senator"" be looked up on prompting with just the query ""Who is the senior senator of Tom Bradyâs birth place?"". The term ""senior senator"" will not be sufficient as that would yield a very large number of documents and ""San Mateo"" term will only be obtained after first step in multi-hop retrieval.\n\nIndeed, the bottom-up approach is not specifically designed for multi-hop knowledge reasoning, as it only activates all knowledge cards just once. Thatâs why we additionally propose the top-down approach, where the knowledge fetching process is multi-hop and iterative.\n\nNevertheless, the bottom-up approach is not useless. It uniquely focuses on **knowledge synthesis**, combining diversified knowledge cards trained on varying domains, refining and condensing generated knowledge into a short passage for LLM QA. The bottom-up approach achieves the best performance on misinformation analysis, showing its capacity to handle multi-faceted documents such as news articles that span diverse knowledge domains.\n\nTo sum up, bottom-up could be adopted in contexts that span multiple knowledge domains, while top-down is recommended for scenarios with more reasoning requirements than just fact retrieval. Future work could explore automatically selecting the right strategy given the downstream task.\n\n> Unlike bottom-up, top-down approach seems iterative where the classifier ""Do you need more information?"" is used to stop iteration. What does the prompt for this look like? How does it perform on a held-out set.\n\nWe refer the reviewer to Table 9, Table 10, and Algorithm 2 in the appendix for the specific prompt. To briefly summarize, we use the prompt â*Do you need more information? (Yes or No)*â. In case of a â*yes*â answer, we additionally use either â*What kind of information do you need?*â or â*Choose an information source from the following: <knowledge card domains>*â to selectively activate knowledge cards for the automatic and explicit selection settings respectively.\n\nWe investigate its effectiveness on the held-out test set in Figure 6. Depending on the difficulty of the question, this mechanism works from 63.02% to 88.23% of the time. While this approach achieves great potential, it is certainly not perfect: we thus call for more research on how to determine if an LLM should request more information for QA and argue that ânew approaches to abstain could be easily integrated into Knowledge Cardâ.\n\n> How is it ensured that all the knowledge cards are being useful? It has been shown that wikipedia can often answer simple questions from other domains, which MMLU dataset often tests.\n\nWe investigate this by how frequently is each card selected for the 57 subtasks in MMLU in Figure 8. While YAGO (general-purpose knowledge graph) and Wikipedia are indeed most frequently activated for knowledge generation, in more domain-specific subtasks such as college chemistry and juris prudence, two other knowledge cards trained on book corpus and legal contracts are also selected to fill in the knowledge gaps of YAGO and Wikipedia. We envision that LLM applications in more domain-specific contexts (biomedical QA, LLM personalization, etc.) would even benefit more from the Knowledge Card framework.\n\n> Typos: handful of knowledge cardds -> handful of knowledge cards\n\nThank you for pointing this out: we will fix this typo.'}}, {'title': {'value': 'Author Response (1/2)'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We would like to thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comments and feedback.\n\n> Existing models that employ similar ideas of modular knowledge organization https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05036.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06311.pdf and datasets that test temporal aspects https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03215.pdf are not compared.\n\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for valuable pointers to related literature.\n\nSince Knowledge Card âspecifically focuses on augmenting **black-box** LLMs to enrich their knowledge capabilitiesâ (Section 1, page 2), while the suggested Demix and ELLE, along with other modular works such as BTM [1] and ColD Fusion [2], operates with **white-box** access to the language model for pretraining and fine-tuning or requiring token probabilities, we argue that they are not comparable.

We did look at other temporal datasets such as TempLAMA [3] and RealTimeQA [4]. While none of them is especially suitable for creating a temporal misalignment in our work, we propose the MidtermQA dataset, focusing on events that happened in late 2022 and early 2023 to investigate Knowledge Cardâs ability to incorporate new and emerging events through a domain-specific knowledge card.\n\nWe agree that these suggested works and works on LLM continual learning [5-8] are indeed relevant and we will add them to the related works to cite and discuss these works, better positioning Knowledge Card in their context.\n\n[1] Li, Margaret, et al.

We demonstrate that an additional knowledge card trained on midterm election news coverage could significantly improve performance and expand LLM knowledge.

In this work, we introduce a straightforward yet effective method for detecting memorized prompts by inspecting the magnitude of text-conditional predictions.

Building on our detection strategy, we unveil an explainable approach that shows the contribution of individual words or tokens to memorization. This offers an interactive medium for users to adjust their prompts. Moreover, we propose two strategies i.e., to mitigate memorization by leveraging the magnitude of text-conditional predictions, either through minimization during inference or filtering during training.

How were these trigger tokens identified, and is there a taxonomy or classification for them?\n\nThis problem was well studied by [1].

However, if under the same repetition rate, [1] found in generating more specific captions are easier to memorize due to their uniqueness.\n\n> Were there any adversarial tests done to ascertain if an attacker could still exploit the memorization tendencies, even after applying the proposed mitigation strategies?\n\nWe have yet to discover any adversarial methods capable of evading our proposed detection and mitigation strategy.

However, we observed that significant text-conditional noise prediction occurs whenever memorization is involved, affirming the effectiveness of our detection and mitigation approaches.\n\nWe hope our response can solve your concern regarding our paper.

Below, we address specific points you raised:\n\n> While the mitigation strategies aim to reduce memorization, it's unclear what impact they might have on the overall performance of the model. Often, there's a trade-off between reducing a particular behavior and maintaining high performance. If these mitigation strategies significantly impair the model's utility, it might deter their adoption.\n\nYes, as shown in Figure 4, there is a small degradation in CLIP score for inference-time mitigation, but not for training-time mitigation. However, we want to emphasize that in practice, the model owner can deploy detection and mitigation strategies at the same time. Therefore, the mitigation will be only applied to memorized prompts, and, in general case, the model performance will not be impaired.\n\nMeanwhile, compared to the copyright issue or privacy issue of outputting memorized training data, we believe it is still beneficial to the company with a little drop in CLIP score in the memorization case.\n\n> User interaction\n\nWe acknowledge your concerns regarding the potential complexity of modifying prompts for some users. However, prompt interaction might be a potential feature. A notable example of this is OpenAI's DALL-E 3, which allows users to iteratively refine their prompts to achieve the desired results. This advanced level of user interaction illustrates both the practicality and the growing trend of user familiarity with such interactive processes. We anticipate that, in the future, users will become increasingly adept at interacting with the models.\n\nAddressing memorization is crucial for users. If the model's outputs contain copyrighted images, users who further utilize these images might also encounter legal issues. Additionally, for memorized prompts, the generated content is often limited to the memorized images. Therefore, modifying the prompt is beneficial for the users to achieve more diverse generations.\n\nFurthermore, for situations where users find it cumbersome to modify prompts or encounter hard-to-alter tokens, the automatic inference-time mitigation method proposed by our paper could be an alternative. This option provides flexibility, catering to different user preferences and capabilities.\n\nOverall, our proposed method offers a new perspective on designing user interfaces and addressing the issue of memorization. We believe that our approach contributes valuable insights for future developments in the field.\n\n> While the paper suggests that the method is computationally efficient, implementing the strategies during the training and inference phases might still introduce computational or operational overheads for model owners.\n\nWe agree that there is a small computational overhead for model owners. Specifically, as mentioned in our paper, our detection method does not require additional computation since the text-conditional noise prediction is calculated during inference. Meanwhile, the inference-time mitigation incurs around 6 seconds for optimization, and a 10% increase in time for training-time mitigation. These costs are negligible compared to potential lawsuits due to memorization. Also, we believe that there is no free lunch to mitigate memorization. Therefore, a minor cost to achieve effective memorization reduction is acceptable.\n\n> Is there any way to quatify memorization in the diffusion models that the future method could use to benchmark? It might be good to have a discussion in this direction.\n\nYes, in our work, we adopt the definition of memorization from previous research [1], where we measure the SSCD similarity between training and generated images using the memorized prompts dataset from [2].\n\nHowever, we acknowledge the potential for developing a more comprehensive benchmark in the future. For instance, categorizing memorization into different types of legal copyright infringement could offer more practical insights. This approach would allow for a comparative analysis of methods under various memorization categories. Although establishing such a benchmark may be labor-intensive, we believe it is crucial and advantageous for advancing the development of reliable generative AI.""}}, {'title': {'value': 'Response to Reviewer VQfz'}, 'comment': {'value': 'We sincerely appreciate your valuable feedback and the time you\'ve dedicated to providing it.

Below, we address specific points you raised:\n\n> Clarifying the Concept of Memorization: Could you provide a clear definition of what constitutes memorization in this context? Does it require an exact match between the generated and training images? For instance, if there's a slight variation, such as a difference of 10 pixels from the original image in the training dataset, would that still be considered memorization?\n\nFollowing [1], we employ the SSCD similarity score to measure memorization. As indicated in our experimental setup, for all memorized prompts from [2], the SSCD similarity score between the memorized and generated images is above 0.7.\n\n[1] and we advocate for the use of SSCD similarity over pixel space distance as a more reliable measure. This is especially relevant in cases where the generated image partially replicates the training image. SSCD focuses on structural and content similarities, not just pixel-level accuracy. This approach offers a more nuanced and context-sensitive evaluation of memorization.\n\n> Exploring Applications for Memorization Detection: I'm interested in understanding the practical uses of detecting memorized images. What are some key scenarios or fields where identifying such images is particularly important or beneficial?\n\nWhen using training datasets that are not as meticulously curated as, for example, the LAION dataset, there is a significant risk of including copyrighted or private images. This underscores the importance of detecting and preventing memorized images, particularly in two primary scenarios:\n1. copyrighted images: When a model generates an image that is an exact replica of a copyrighted image, the owner of that copyright may have grounds to sue the model owner. This situation can result in financial losses for the model owner.\n2. private images: The situation becomes more critical if the memorized image contains private data, like a patient's CT scan. Unauthorized reproduction of such private images can result in severe breaches of privacy, leading to legal and ethical issues.\n\nGiven these scenarios, it is evident that the need for an effective memorization detection tool goes beyond these examples. There are likely other scenarios where such a tool would be crucial in managing the potential risks.\n\nWe hope our response can solve your concern regarding our paper.

Text-conditional diffusion models employ a pre-trained text encoder, which controls the alignment of image generation to a given prompt.

However, with different prompts but identical initializations, the images display similarities. When the model uses memorized prompts, the output tends to be consistent, hinting at overfitting. One of the significant findings is the relationship between the magnitude of text-conditional noise predictions and the chances of an image being memorized. This paper proposed a method, allowing early detection of memorized prompts, potentially saving computational resources. The effectiveness of this method is further discussed in an experimental setup, where it surpasses other baseline methods in speed and accuracy. Additionally, the concept of \\emph{trigger tokens} is introduced. These are specific words or tokens in a prompt that have a significant impact on the generation process.

In particular, we propose an easily implemented method based on the \emph{pivotal sampling algorithm}, which we test on problems motivated by learning-based methods for parametric PDEs and uncertainty quantification. In comparison to independent sampling, our method reduces the number of samples needed to reach a given target accuracy by up to $50\%$.We support our findings with two theoretical results. First, we show that any non-independent leverage score sampling method that obeys a weak \emph{one-sided $\ell_{\infty}$ independence condition} (which includes pivotal sampling) can actively learn $d$ dimensional linear functions with $O(d\log d)$ samples, matching independent sampling. This result extends recent work on matrix Chernoff bounds under $\ell_{\infty}$ independence, and may be of interest for analyzing other sampling strategies beyond pivotal sampling.

For the experiment in the appendix, we tuned these parameters optimally for one specific problem, and the method was able to slightly outperform leverage score sampling. However, our best general purpose implementation (with parameters fixed across different problems) performed worse than the baseline i.i.d. leverage score sampling, which is why we did not include the results to begin with.

Reviewer hDW2 also asked about runtime, so I will paste the response below. We agree that the paper would benefit from increased discussion and experimental results on runtime. \n\nWe will also consider additional baselines. We did implement the randomized BSS method from [Chen, Price 2019], although found it was uncompetitive (there is an experiment in Appendix D). Another option would be to consider e.g. square root leverage scores sampling, which was discussed in âA Statistical Perspective on Algorithmic Leveragingâ by Ma, Mahoney, Yu. We are not 100% sure what method the reviewer is referring to as âmaximum leverage score samplingâ. Do you mean the method from the paper âProvable Deterministic Leverage Score Samplingâ by Papailiopoulos, Kyrillidis, and Boutsidis? That paper selects the rows in A with the *largest* leverage scores. While this method works well in many settings, it performs very poorly for polynomial regression and related âcontinuousâ problems where nearby points typically have similar leverage scores. For example, for polynomial regression, maximum leverage score sampling would *only* select samples right near the edge of the interval or box that we are fitting the function over. \n\nComments on runtime to Reviewer hDW2:\nOn average, we found that our PCA-based pivotal methods run in approximately 125% of the time of the baseline i.i.d. leverage score sampling method and the coordinate-wise splitting method runs in 114% of the time. So, the PCA method is slower, but the overhead is low overall. \n\nThe reason for the low-overhead is that PCA is being run on *low-dimensional* data points. E.g., for a degree s polynomials in q=2 dimensions, PCA is being run on q=2 dimensional points, even though the dimension of the polynomial regression problem is d = O(s^2) (in our experiments, d = 60+). Additionally, since the size of the PCA problems is decreasing by a factor of 2 at every step of the splitting method, the total runtime cost of constructing the pivotal sampling tree is roughly O(nq^2log n). Accordingly, we found that the complexity of our method was dominated by the cost of computing leverage scores for the matrix A, which naively takes O(nd^2). This cost is also incurred by naive i.i.d. sampling. We do note that faster algorithms for approximating leverage scores are well studied and can be used instead. See e.g., the paper âFast approximation of matrix coherence and statistical leverageâ by Drineas, Magdon-Ismail, Mahoney, and Woodruff, and follow-up work, which improves the cost to time O(nd + d^3).'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the accurate summary of our contributions and suggestions. We respond to specific comments below, but please let us know if you have any additional questions.\n\nâ The empirical evaluation lacks clarity regarding the improvementsâ¦\nWe agree with the suggestion here. The 50% improvement can be seen most clearly in Appendix D, where Table 1 and Table 2 compare the number of samples needed to achieve a given level of error. We are tight on space, but will plan on moving at least one of these tables up to the main experiments section in the final version of the paper. \n\nâ It would be interesting to explore whether the pivotal sampling method has other implications for different norms. \nWe think this is a really nice question for future work, especially given recent progress on understanding optimal sampling results for polynomial regression in various norms (see e.g. the cited work by [Meyer et al. 2023]). We would optimistically predict that we could similarly remove log(d) factors using tournament style methods like pivotal sampling, although the theoretical analysis will have to differ significantly. It would also be interesting to establish a general result like Theorem 1.1 for other norms, e.g. for lp norms, for which the optimal sampling probabilities are based on lp Lewis weights.\n\nâ If the running time is a major concern in large-scale systems or datasets, it isnât clear if a PCA-based approach is always feasible.\nWe will plan on adding some discussion on runtime to the final version of the paper. We can also add some basic experimental results. On average, we found that our PCA-based pivotal methods run in approximately 125% of the time of the baseline i.i.d. leverage score sampling method and the coordinate-wise splitting method runs in 114% of the time. So, the PCA method is slower as the reviewer notes, but the overhead is low overall. \n\nThe reason for the low-overhead is that PCA is being run on *low-dimensional* data points.

The final sample complexity will be c*(d log d)*(1/D_inf^2) + (d/epsilon)*(1/D_inf). \n\nFinally, we thank the reviewer for suggestions on experiments to add, and will consider the random permutation method as a baseline. We actually did implement the [Chen, Price 2019] method, and include one experiment in the appendix (Figure 8,c). We spent quite a bit of time optimizing the choice of constants in that method. We were ultimately able to beat i.i.d leverage score sampling, but only by a little bit. The method requires notably more samples than pivotal sampling.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'Thank you for the thoughtful response. We respond below to your questions about the connection of our results to prior work. Please let us know if you have any additional questions.\n\nThe first Lemma asked about, Lemma B.1, is not our result, but rather a result we use from [Kaufman et al., 2022]. This lemma is a strong generalization of prior matrix Bernstein inequalities (including the one cited by the reviewer) because prior matrix Bernstein bounds only apply when Y_1, â¦, Y_n are sampled *independently*. Lemma B.1 applies to *non-independent* sampling distributions (like pivotal sampling) as long as the distribution is homogenous and satisfies the l_infinity independence guarantees.  [Kaufman et al., 2022]âs result is the culmination of a line of work on relaxing the independence requirement. For example, prior work in [Kyng, Song, 2018] proved matrix concentration inequalities for non-independent strongly Rayleigh distributions, which is a subset of l_infinity independent distributions. Similarly, approximate matrix-multiplication results were known for independent sampling, but not for dependent distributions. Our main technical contribution in proving Theorem 1.1 is to show that approximate matrix-multiplication can *also* be generalized to the case when sampling is dependent, but satisfies l_infinity independence. This proof is on Page 14 and 15 of the appendix. Combining with the existing results from [Kaufman et al., 2022] establishes Theorem 1.1. Finally, we stress that some sort of correlation (non-independence) between samples is necessary to produce a spatially well-balanced distribution.\n\nThe contribution of Theorem 1.2 differs from that of Theorem 1.1 because the result of Theorem 1.2 (which is specialized to fitting polynomials) has sample complexity O(d) instead of O(dlogd). Independent leverage score sampling requires O(dlogd) samples for fitting degree d polynomials, so Theorem 1.2 shows a concrete setting where pivotal sampling gives a provably stronger bound (i.e., it eliminates a log d). To prove this bound, we cannot use matrix concentration inequalities at all (even those of [Kaufman et al., 2022])  since these bounds inherently involve a log d factor. So, we instead prove the required subspace embedding guarantee âfrom scratchâ using tools from polynomial approximation theory. For example, one ingredient of the proof is that we establish a tighter non-asymptotic bound relating the leverage scores for polynomial regression to the Chebyshev density (Theorem C.3).'}}, {'summary': {'value': 'The authors suggest a modification of the pivotal sampling algorithm which allows for better domain coverage in such an applications as approximating PDE solutions.'}, 'soundness': {'value': '4 excellent'}, 'presentation': {'value': '3 good'}, 'contribution': {'value': '3 good'}, 'strengths': {'value': 'The paper is well-written with clear motivation for the main theoretical results and nice experimental illustrations.

Despite the complexity and importance of this task, it has yet to be meaningfully studied due to the challenges of evaluation: existing book-length summarization datasets (e.g., BookSum) are in the pretraining data of most public LLMs, and existing evaluation methods struggle to capture errors made by modern LLM summarizers. In this paper, we present the first study of the coherence of LLM-based book-length summarizers implemented via two prompting workflows: (1) hierarchically merging chunk-level summaries, and (2) incrementally updating a running summary. We obtain 1193 fine-grained human annotations on GPT-4 generated summaries of 100 recently-published books and identify eight common types of coherence errors made by LLMs. Because human evaluation is expensive and time-consuming, we develop an automatic metric, BooookScore, that measures the proportion of sentences in a summary that do not contain any of the identified error types. BooookScore has high agreement with human annotations and allows us to systematically evaluate the impact of many other critical parameters (e.g., chunk size, base LLM) while saving \$15K USD and 500 hours in human evaluation costs. We find that closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 2 produce summaries with higher BooookScore than those generated by open-source models. While LLaMA 2 falls behind other models, Mixtral achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-Turbo. Incremental updating yields lower BooookScore but higher level of detail than hierarchical merging, a trade-off sometimes preferred by annotators.

However, the authors are open about this limitation.*\n\nIn order to measure recall, we would require ground truth annotations with all possible coherence errors in the summaries. However, prior studies (SNaC and Scarecrow) have discussed that this is challenging for subjective fine-grained evaluation tasks where annotators generally display high precision but low recall.\n\nOne solution could be to collect annotations from multiple annotations per summary, and consider their union as the exhaustive set of errors. Scarecrow and SNaC employ 10 and 3 annotators per summary respectively, but such a scheme would be very costly for our setting, as annotating 100 summaries already costs $1.5K. Annotation precision is more economical to evaluate, while also serving as an informative metric. We have updated Section 3 to make it clearer. We believe future work in human evaluation that makes recall-centric annotation more tractable is a promising area that could complement the precision-centric measurement we propose here.\n\n*> Some of the examples of types of errors shown in Table 1 seem to be of questionable qualityâ¦*\n\nThis is a valid concern, and we appreciate the reviewer for pointing it out.

We computed the average number of tokens per sentence for the 100 summaries collected under each configuration (10 in total). The minimum is 21, maximum is 28.3, and standard deviation is 2.5. Future work may decompose the summary into atomic units (like FactScore) before running fine-grained evaluation.

This could have been done by asking annotators to assess each fact and search for it inside the book to verify its factuality.*\n\nWe thank the reviewer for proposing a possible experimental setup for evaluating faithfulness. Coincidentally, we did try the task ourselves using the exact setup as described in the reviewerâs comments, and found it incredibly challenging. Some facts may span multiple pages, even chapters, of a book, and verifying a single fact could take 10-20 minutes, let alone a full summaryâs worth. Considering the amount of time, money, and energy it would take to complete a full-scale human evaluation of faithfulness, we decided to stick to coherence and acknowledge that our work is complementary in nature. Prior work like LongEval and FactScore have established guidelines and methods for evaluating faithfulness, and our evaluation protocols can always be adapted to or combined with these work for faithfulness evaluation. We focus on coherence as it emerges as a noteworthy problem on its own when it comes to evaluating very long summaries of book-length documents.\n\n*> How did you choose the number of O in BOOOOKSCORE?*\n\nThere are 4 Oâs in BOOOOKSCORE because we have four authors on the paper!'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments and for appreciating the importance of our work to future research in summarization.\n\n*> One point I miss in the experiments is a baseline without hierarchical merging or incremental updating.*\n\nThis is indeed a valid concern, we appreciate the reviewer for bringing it up. To address this issue, we evaluated GPT-4 on the SQuALITY dataset, which contains short sci-fi stories that are 4000-6000 words long. Results from these experiments have been added to Appendix E. Here, we show that the baseline method (without merging or incremental updating) produces slightly better summaries than incremental updating (in terms of ROUGE-L score), and we are currently running BOOOOKSCORE on this dataset as well for a more specific analysis of coherence. Additionally, qualitative inspection of these summaries (added in Appendix E.1) shows that they are not only superior to those produced by incremental updating but also human reference summaries from the dataset, which is aligned with results from recent work on LLM-based short-document summarization: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09558. Our experiments overall suggest that approaches like incremental updating can introduce coherence errors into LLM-generated summaries.\n\n*> Not finding results online by no means imply that memorization is impossible.*\n\nIt is true that closed-source models may have been trained on publicly available data, we thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have adjusted our wording in the paper to be more precise. That said, there is still a very low chance that these models have seen actual summaries of those books given how recently the books were published. All books in our dataset were published after the beginning of 2022, and 87% of them were published in 2023. For our experiments, we used the gpt-4 2023-03-15 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 checkpoints on Microsoft Azure. Both models have a training data cutoff date of Sep. 2021. Anthropic unfortunately does not disclose checkpoint information, but our summaries were all obtained via their Claude 2 API in September 2023. We also note that most of the books are not (yet) widely read, making it even less likely that readers have written high-quality summaries. Overall, we made diligent efforts within our control to avoid testing on the training set.\n\n*> However, your experimental findings show that hierarchical merging results in more coherent summaries. Do you have an explanation for this observation?*\n\nPrior to running our experiments, our theory was that incremental updating should enable the model to take more context into consideration when composing summaries. We understand that our phrasing in the paper is too definitive, and have revised it to clarify that this was our hypothesis.\n\nOur results show the opposite, and we hypothesize some reasons for this in Section 5 of the paper. Essentially, incremental updating is inherently a more complex task, as it requires the model to maintain a running summary as it steps through chunks of a book. When deciding what to include from the current book chunk and what to remove from the current summary, the model needs to juggle texts of different levels of granularity. Plus, the model must compress the summary whenever it exceeds the final summary limit, which could further affect coherence. For the chunk size = 2048 setting, models need to compress 17.6 times per book on average, while each book has 68 chunks on average. Hierarchical merging, on the other hand, only requires the model to summarize individual chunks and recursively merge them together. If a single summary gets too long, it would often be enough to simply have the model regenerate. This approach does not involve working with texts of different granularity levels or compressing summaries while maintaining coherence.'}}, {'comment': {'value': 'We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments and for appreciating our extensive experiments, clear writing, and innovative evaluation metric design.\n\n*> The approach of weighing all sentences equally may overlook the varying importance of different parts of the text for overall coherence.*\n\nWe acknowledge that weighing all sentences equally may overlook the relative importance of different parts of the text to overall coherence. One way to mitigate this problem is to assign severity weights to different error types, as in MQM for machine translation. However, this step introduces more subjectivity into the evaluation procedure (e.g., see https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18201 for similar concerns in long-form QA), which is why we chose to equally weight all errors. It is unclear how the weights should be chosen, and whether a single weighting scheme makes sense in all scenarios. Future work can further explore correlations between different weighting schemes and human judgments of overall summary coherence.\n\n*> there is an absence of a consistency check for the evaluation metric.*\n\nWe understand the importance of the consistency check (i.e., if you resampled summaries from each LLM, would you obtain the same ranking of systems?), and appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this issue. That said, running multiple iterations of full-scale experiments is expensive (it can cost roughly $1-2K to collect 100 summaries from closed-source LLMs, depending on which model and chunk size are used). Instead, we ran a bootstrapping analysis where given 100 summaries generated under one configuration, we generated 1000 random samples with replacement using a sample size of 100, then computed BOOOOKSCORE for the 1000 samples. The scores have a standard deviation of 0.015, which indicates that BOOOOKSCORE is stable across varying random samples.

This may be a side effect of offering a monetary reward based in part on the number of annotations (cf. Appendix G).\n- The sentence-level score may disproportionately favor summaries that contain a large number of (short) sentences.

Despite the complexity and importance of this task, it has yet to be meaningfully studied due to the challenges of evaluation: existing book-length summarization datasets (e.g., BookSum) are in the pretraining data of most public LLMs, and existing evaluation methods struggle to capture errors made by modern LLM summarizers. In this paper, we present the first study of the coherence of LLM-based book-length summarizers implemented via two prompting workflows: (1) hierarchically merging chunk-level summaries, and (2) incrementally updating a running summary. We obtain 1193 fine-grained human annotations on GPT-4 generated summaries of 100 recently-published books and identify eight common types of coherence errors made by LLMs. Because human evaluation is expensive and time-consuming, we develop an automatic metric, BooookScore, that measures the proportion of sentences in a summary that do not contain any of the identified error types. BooookScore has high agreement with human annotations and allows us to systematically evaluate the impact of many other critical parameters (e.g., chunk size, base LLM) while saving \\$15K USD and 500 hours in human evaluation costs. We find that closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 2 produce summaries with higher BooookScore than those generated by open-source models. While LLaMA 2 falls behind other models, Mixtral achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-Turbo. Incremental updating yields lower BooookScore but higher level of detail than hierarchical merging, a trade-off sometimes preferred by annotators.
