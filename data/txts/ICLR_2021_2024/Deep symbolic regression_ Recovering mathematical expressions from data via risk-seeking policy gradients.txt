ABSTRACT
Discovering the underlying mathematical expressions describing a dataset is a core
challenge for artiﬁcial intelligence. This is the problem of symbolic regression.
Despite recent advances in training neural networks to solve complex tasks, deep
learning approaches to symbolic regression are underexplored. We propose a
framework that leverages deep learning for symbolic regression via a simple
idea: use a large model to search the space of small models. Speciﬁcally, we
use a recurrent neural network to emit a distribution over tractable mathematical
expressions and employ a novel risk-seeking policy gradient to train the network
to generate better-ﬁtting expressions. Our algorithm outperforms several baseline
methods (including Eureqa, the gold standard for symbolic regression) in its ability
to exactly recover symbolic expressions on a series of benchmark problems, both
with and without added noise. More broadly, our contributions include a framework
that can be applied to optimize hierarchical, variable-length objects under a black-
box performance metric, with the ability to incorporate constraints in situ, and a
risk-seeking policy gradient formulation that optimizes for best-case performance
instead of expected performance.

INTRODUCTION
Understanding the mathematical relationships among variables in a physical system is an integral
component of the scientiﬁc process. Symbolic regression aims to identify these relationships by
searching over the space of tractable (i.e. concise, closed-form) mathematical expressions to best
ﬁt a dataset. Speciﬁcally, given a dataset (X, y), where each point Xi ∈Rn and yi ∈R, symbolic
regression aims to identify a function f : Rn →R that best ﬁts the dataset, where the functional
form of f is a short mathematical expression. The resulting expression can be readily interpreted
and/or provide useful scientiﬁc insights simply by inspection. In contrast, conventional regression
imposes a single model structure that is ﬁxed during training, often chosen to be expressive (e.g. a
neural network) at the expense of being easily interpretable.

Symbolic regression exhibits several unique features that make it an excellent test problem for
benchmarking automated machine learning (AutoML) and program synthesis methods: (1) there exist
well-established, challenging benchmark problems with stringent success criteria (White et al., 2013);
(2) there exist well-established baseline methods (most notably, the Eureqa algorithm (Schmidt
& Lipson, 2009)); and (3) the reward function is computationally expedient, allowing sufﬁcient
experiment replicates to achieve statistical signiﬁcance. Most other AutoML tasks, e.g. neural
architecture search (NAS), do not exhibit these features; in fact, even simply evaluating the efﬁciency
of the discrete search itself is a known challenge within NAS (Yu et al., 2019).
The space of mathematical expressions is discrete (in model structure) and continuous (in model
parameters), growing exponentially with the length of the expression, rendering symbolic regression
a challenging machine learning problem—thought to be NP-hard (Lu et al., 2016). Given this
large, combinatorial search space, traditional approaches to symbolic regression typically utilize
evolutionary algorithms, especially genetic programming (GP) (Koza, 1992; Schmidt & Lipson, 2009;
B¨ack et al., 2018). In GP-based symbolic regression, a population of mathematical expressions is
“evolved” using evolutionary operations like selection, crossover, and mutation to improve a ﬁtness
function. While GP can be effective, it is also known to scale poorly to larger problems and to exhibit
high sensitivity to hyperparameters.
Deep learning has permeated almost all areas of artiﬁcial intelligence, from computer vision
(Krizhevsky et al., 2012) to optimal control (Mnih et al., 2015). However, deep learning may
seem incongruous with or even antithetical toward symbolic regression, given that neural networks
are typically highly complex, difﬁcult to interpret, and rely on gradient information. We propose a
framework that resolves this incongruity by tying deep learning and symbolic regression together
with a simple idea: use a large model (i.e. neural network) to search the space of small models (i.e.
symbolic expressions). This framework leverages the representational capacity of neural networks to
generate interpretable expressions, while entirely bypassing the need to interpret the network itself.
We present deep symbolic regression (DSR), a gradient-based approach for symbolic regression
based on reinforcement learning. In DSR, a recurrent neural network (RNN) emits a distribution over
mathematical expressions. Expressions are sampled from the distribution, instantiated, and evaluated
based on their ﬁtness to the dataset. This ﬁtness is used as the reward signal to train the RNN using a
novel risk-seeking policy gradient algorithm. As training proceeds, the RNN adjusts the likelihood of
an expression relative to its reward, assigning higher probabilities to better expressions.
We demonstrate that DSR outperforms several baseline methods, including two commercial software
algorithms. We summarize our contributions as follows: (1) a novel method for symbolic regression
that outperforms several baselines on a set of benchmark problems, (2) an autoregressive generative
modeling framework for optimizing hierarchical, variable-length objects that accommodates in situ
constraints, and (3) a novel risk-seeking policy gradient objective and accompanying Monte Carlo
estimation procedure that optimizes for best-case performance instead of average performance.

RELATED WORK
Deep learning for symbolic regression. Several recent approaches leverage deep learning for
symbolic regression. AI Feynman (Udrescu & Tegmark, 2020) propose a problem-simpliﬁcation
tool for symbolic regression. They use neural networks to identify simplifying properties in a
dataset (e.g. multiplicative separability, translational symmetry), which they exploit to recursively
deﬁne simpliﬁed sub-problems that can then be tackled using any symbolic regression algorithm. In
GrammarVAE, Kusner et al. (2017) develop a generative model for discrete objects that adhere to a
pre-speciﬁed grammar, then optimize them in latent space. They demonstrate this can be used for
symbolic regression; however, the method struggles to exactly recover expressions, and the generated
expressions are not always syntactically valid. Sahoo et al. (2018) develop a symbolic regression
framework using neural networks whose activation functions are symbolic operators. While this
approach enables an end-to-end differentiable system, backpropagation through activation functions
like division or logarithm requires the authors to make several simpliﬁcations to the search space,
ultimately precluding learning certain simple classes of expressions like √x or sin(x/y). We address
and/or directly compare to these works in Appendices C and E.

AutoML and program synthesis. Symbolic regression is related to both automated machine learning
(AutoML) and program synthesis, in that they all involve a search for an executable program (i.e.
expression) to solve a particular task (i.e. to ﬁt data) (Abolaﬁa et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2017;
Riedel et al., 2016). More speciﬁcally, our framework has many parallels to a body of works
within AutoML that use an autoregressive RNN to deﬁne a distribution over discrete objects and use
reinforcement learning to optimize this distribution under a black-box performance metric (Zoph
& Le, 2017; Ramachandran et al., 2017; Bello et al., 2017; Abolaﬁa et al., 2018). For example,
in neural architecture search (Zoph & Le, 2017), an RNN searches the space of neural network
architectures, encoded by a sequence of discrete “tokens” specifying architectural properties (e.g.
number of neurons) of each layer. The length of the sequence is ﬁxed or scheduled during training; in
contrast, our framework deﬁnes a search space that is both inherently hierarchical and variable length.
Ramachandran et al. (2017) search the space of neural network activation functions. While this space
is hierarchical in nature, the authors (rightfully) constrain it substantially by positing a functional
unit that is repeated sequentially, thus restricting their search space back to a ﬁxed-length sequence.
However, a repeating-unit constraint is not practical for symbolic regression because the ground truth
expression may have arbitrary structure.
Autoregressive models. The RNN-based distribution over expressions used in DSR is autoregressive,
meaning each token is conditioned on the previously sampled tokens. Autoregressive models have
proven to be useful for audio and image data (Oord et al., 2016a;b) in addition to the AutoML works
discussed above; we further demonstrate their efﬁcacy for hierarchical expressions. GraphRNN
deﬁnes a distribution over graphs that generates an adjacency matrix one column at a time in
autoregressive fashion (You et al., 2018). In principle, GraphRNN could be constrained to deﬁne a
distribution over expressions, since trees are a special case of graphs. However, GraphRNN constructs
graphs breadth-ﬁrst, whereas expressions are more naturally represented using depth-ﬁrst traversals
(Li et al., 2005). Further, DSR exploits the hierarchical nature of trees by providing the parent and
sibling as inputs to the RNN, and leverages the additional structure of expression trees that a node’s
value determines its number of children (e.g. cosine is a unary operator and thus has one child).
Risk-aware reinforcement learning. Many of the AutoML methods discussed above suffer from
what we call the “expectation problem.” That is, policy gradient methods are fundamentally suited for
optimizing expectations; however, domains like neural architecture search and symbolic regression
are evaluated by the few or single best-performing samples. Thus, there is a mismatch between
the training objective function and the true desired objective: to maximize best-case performance.
Abolaﬁa et al. (2018) address the expectation problem by maintaining a priority queue of the best
seen samples and using supervised learning to increase the likelihood of those top samples. Similarly,
Liang et al. (2018) use a memory buffer to augment a policy gradient with off-policy training. These
methods, however, only apply in the context of reinforcement learning environments with both
deterministic transition dynamics and deterministic rewards. In contrast, the risk-seeking policy
gradient introduced here is general, applying to any reinforcement learning environment and any
stochastic policy gradient algorithm trained using batches, e.g. on Atari using proximal policy
optimization (Schulman et al., 2017). Lastly, our risk-seeking policy gradient is closely related to the
EPOpt-ε algorithm used for robust reinforcement learning (Rajeswaran et al., 2016), which is based
on a risk-averse policy gradient formulation (Tamar et al., 2014).

METHODS
Our overall approach involves representing mathematical expressions as sequences, developing an
autoregressive model to generate expressions under a pre-speciﬁed set of constraints, and developing
a risk-seeking policy gradient to train the model to generate better-ﬁtting expressions.

GENERATING EXPRESSIONS WITH A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK
We leverage the fact that mathematical expressions can be represented using symbolic expression
trees. Expression trees are a type of binary tree in which internal nodes are mathematical operators
and terminal nodes are input variables or constants. Operators may be unary (i.e. one argument, such
as sine) or binary (i.e. two arguments, such as multiply). Further, we can represent an expression tree
as a sequence of node values or “tokens” by using its pre-order traversal (i.e. by visiting each node
depth-ﬁrst, then left-to-right). This allows us to generate an expression tree sequentially while still

Figure 1: A. Example of sampling an expression from the RNN. For each token, the RNN emits a
categorical distribution over tokens, a token is sampled, and the parent and sibling of the next token
are used as the next input to the RNN. Subsequent tokens are sampled autoregressively until the tree
is complete (i.e. all tree branches reach terminal nodes). The resulting sequence of tokens is the
tree’s pre-order traversal, which can be used to reconstruct the tree and instantiate its corresponding
expression. Colors correspond to the number of children for each token. White circles represent
empty tokens. Numbers indicate the order in which tokens were sampled. B. The library of tokens. C.

the value of the constant c is optimized with respect to an input dataset.
maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between the tree and its traversal.1 Thus, we represent an
expression τ by the pre-order traversal of its corresponding expression tree.2 We denote the ith token
of the traversal as τi and the length of the traversal as |τ| = T. Each token has a value within a given
library L of possible tokens, e.g. {+, −, ×, ÷, sin, x}.
We generate expressions one token at a time along the pre-order traversal (from τ1 to τT ). A
categorical distribution with parameters ψ deﬁnes the probabilities of selecting each token from L.
To capture the “context” of the expression as it is being generated, we condition this probability upon
the selections of all previous tokens in that traversal. This conditional dependence can be achieved
very generally using an RNN with parameters θ that emits a probability vector ψ in an autoregressive
manner. Speciﬁcally, the ith output of the RNN passes through a softmax layer (with shared weights
across time steps) to produce vector ψ(i), which deﬁnes the probability distribution for selecting the
ith token τi, conditioned on the previously selected tokens τ1:(i−1). That is, p(τi|τ1:(i−1); θ) = ψ(i)
L(τi),
where L(τi) is the index in L corresponding to τi. The likelihood of the entire sampled expression is
simply the product of the likelihoods of its tokens: p(τ|θ) = Q|τ|
i=1 p(τi|τ1:(i−1); θ) = Q|τ|

L(τi).
An example of the sampling process is illustrated in Figure 1; pseudocode is provided in Algorithm
2 in Appendix A. Note that different samples from the distribution have different tree structures of
different size; thus, the search space is inherently both hierarchical and variable length.
Providing hierarchical inputs to the RNN. Conventionally, the input to the RNN when sampling
a token would be a representation of the previously sampled token. However, the search space for
symbolic regression is inherently hierarchical, and the previously sampled token may actually be
very distant from the next token to be sampled in the expression tree. For example, the ﬁfth and
1In general, a pre-order traversal is insufﬁcient to uniquely reconstruct the tree. However, here we know how
many children each node has based on its value, e.g. “multiply” is a binary operator and thus has two children. A
pre-order traversal plus the corresponding number of children for each node is sufﬁcient to uniquely reconstruct
the tree.
2Given an expression tree, the corresponding mathematical expression is unique; however, given an expres-
sion, its expression tree is not unique. For example, x2 and x × x are equivalent expressions but yield different
trees. For simplicity, we use τ somewhat abusively to refer to an expression where it technically refers to an
expression tree (or equivalently, its pre-order traversal).

sixth tokens sampled in Figure 1 are adjacent nodes in the traversal but are four edges apart in
the expression tree. To better capture hierarchical information, we provide as inputs to the RNN a
representation of the parent and sibling nodes of the token being sampled. We introduce an empty
token for cases in which a node does not have a parent or sibling. Pseudocode for identifying the
parent and sibling nodes given a partial traversal is provided in Subroutine 1 in Appendix A.
Constraining the search space. Under our framework, it is straightforward to apply a priori
constraints to reduce the search space. To demonstrate, we impose several simple, domain-agnostic
constraints: (1) Expressions are limited to a pre-speciﬁed minimum and maximum length. We
selected minimum length of 4 to prevent trivial expressions and a maximum length of 30 to ensure
expressions are tractable. (2) The children of an operator should not all be constants, as the result
would simply be a different constant. (3) The child of a unary operator should not be the inverse of
that operator, e.g. log(exp(x)) is not allowed. (4) Descendants of trigonometric operators should not
be trigonometric operators, e.g. sin(x + cos(x)) is not allowed because cosine is a descendant of
sine. While still semantically meaningful, such composed trigonometric operators do not appear in
virtually any scientiﬁc domain.
We apply these constraints in situ (i.e. concurrently with autoregressive sampling) by zeroing out
the probabilities of selecting tokens that would violate a constraint. Pseudocode for this process is
provided in Subroutine 2 in Appendix A. This process ensures that samples always adhere to all
constraints, without rejecting samples post hoc. In contrast, imposing constraints with GP requires
rejecting evolutionary operations post hoc (Fortin et al., 2012), which can be problematic (Craenen
et al., 2001), and as we show in our experiments, can actually reduce performance.
Reward function. Once a pre-order traversal is sampled, we instantiate the corresponding symbolic
expression and evaluate it with a reward function. A standard ﬁtness measure in GP-based symbolic
regression is normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), the root-mean-square error normalized by
the standard deviation of the target values, σy. That is, given a dataset (X, y) of size n and candidate
expression f, NRMSE =

i=1(yi −f(Xi))2. To bound the reward function, we apply a
squashing function: R(τ) = 1/(1 + NRMSE).
Constant optimization. If the library L includes the constant token, sampled expressions may in-
clude several constant placeholders. These can be viewed as parameters ξ of the symbolic expression,
which we optimize by maximizing the reward function: ξ⋆= arg maxξ R(τ; ξ), using a nonlinear
optimization algorithm, e.g. BFGS (Fletcher, 2013). We perform this inner optimization loop for
each sampled expression as part of the reward computation before performing each training step.
3.2
TRAINING THE RNN USING POLICY GRADIENTS
The reward function is not differentiable with respect to θ; thus, we turn to reinforcement learning to
train the RNN to produce better-ﬁtting expressions. In this view, the distribution over mathematical
expressions p(τ|θ) is like a policy, sampled tokens are like actions, the parent and sibling inputs
are like observations, sequences corresponding to expressions are like episodes, and the reward is a
terminal, undiscounted reward only computed when an expression completes.
Standard policy gradient. We ﬁrst consider the standard policy gradient objective to maximize
Jstd(θ), deﬁned as the expectation of a reward function R(τ) under expressions from the policy:
Jstd(θ) .= Eτ∼p(τ|θ) [R(τ)]. The standard REINFORCE policy gradient (Williams, 1992) can be
used to maximize this expectation via gradient ascent:
∇θJstd(θ) = ∇θEτ∼p(τ|θ) [R(τ)]
= Eτ∼p(τ|θ) [R(τ)∇θ log p(τ|θ)]
This result allows one to estimate the expectation using samples from the distribution. Speciﬁcally,
an unbiased estimate of ∇θJstd(θ) can be obtained by computing the sample mean over a batch of N
sampled expressions T = {τ (i)}N
i=1:
∇θJstd(θ) ≈1

R(τ (i))∇θ log p(τ (i)|θ)
This is an unbiased gradient estimate, but in practice it has high variance. To reduce variance, it is
common to subtract a baseline function b from the reward. As long as the baseline is not a function of
5

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
the current batch of expressions, the gradient estimate is still unbiased. Common choices of baseline
functions are a moving average of rewards or an estimate of the value function. Intuitively, the
gradient step increases the likelihood of expressions above the baseline and decreases the likelihood
of expressions below.
Risk-seeking policy gradient. The standard policy gradient objective, Jstd(θ), is deﬁned as an
expectation. This is the desired objective for control problems in which one seeks to optimize the
average performance of a policy. However, in domains like symbolic regression, program synthesis,
or neural architecture search, the ﬁnal performance is measured by the single or few best-performing
samples found during training. Similarly, one might be interested in a policy that achieves a “high
score” in a control environment (e.g. Atari). For such problems, Jstd(θ) is not an appropriate
objective, as there is a mismatch between the objective being optimized and the ﬁnal performance
metric; this is the “expectation problem.” To address this disconnect, we propose an alternative
objective that focuses learning only on maximizing best-case performance. We ﬁrst deﬁne Rε(θ) as
the (1 −ε)-quantile of the distribution of rewards under the current policy. Note this is a function of θ
but is typically intractable. We then propose a new learning objective, Jrisk(θ; ε), parameterized by ε:
Jrisk(θ; ε) .= Eτ∼p(τ|θ) [R(τ) | R(τ) ≥Rε(θ)]
(1)
This objective aims to increase the reward of the top ε fraction of samples from the distribution,
without regard for samples below that threshold. This objective bears close resemblance with ε-
conditional value at risk (CVaR), for which the “≤” symbol is used instead of “≥” and the ε-quantile
of rewards is used instead of the (1 −ε)-quantile. Optimizing CVaR is a form of risk-averse learning
that results in a policy that is robust against catastrophic outcomes (Tamar et al., 2014; Rajeswaran
et al., 2016). In contrast, optimizing Jrisk(θ; ε) yields a risk-seeking policy gradient that aims to
increase best-case performance at the expense of lower worst-case and average performances. Next,
we show the analogous policy gradient of Jrisk(θ; ε) and how to estimate it via Monte Carlo sampling.
Proposition 1. Let Jrisk(θ; ε) denote the conditional expectation of rewards above the (1−ε)-quantile,
as in Equation (1). Then the gradient of Jrisk(θ; ε) is given by:
∇θJrisk(θ; ε) = Eτ∼p(τ|θ)[(R(τ) −Rε(θ)) · ∇θ log p(τ|θ) | R(τ) ≥Rε(θ)]
The proof and assumptions are provided in Appendix B, and are adapted from the policy gradient
derivation for the CVaR objective (Tamar et al., 2014). This result suggests a simple Monte Carlo
estimate of the gradient from a batch of N samples:
∇θJrisk(θ; ε) ≈

i=1
h
R(τ (i)) −˜Rε(θ)
i
· 1R(τ (i))≥˜
Rε(θ)∇θ log p(τ (i)|θ),
where ˜Rε(θ) is the empirical (1 −ε)-quantile of the batch of rewards, and 1x returns 1 if condition x
is true and 0 otherwise. Essentially, this is the standard REINFORCE Monte Carlo estimate with two
differences: (1) theory suggests a speciﬁc baseline, Rε(θ), whereas the baseline for standard policy
gradients is non-speciﬁc, chosen by the user; and (2) effectively, only the top ε fraction of samples
from each batch are used in the gradient computation. This process is essentially the opposite of
the approach used to optimize CVaR (Tamar et al., 2014; Rajeswaran et al., 2016) for risk-averse
reinforcement learning, in which only the bottom ε fraction of samples from each batch are used.
Note that in Proposition 1 and the corresponding Monte Carlo estimation procedure, τ need not
refer to a symbolic expression or even a discrete object. For example, it may refer to a state-action
trajectory in a control problem. Thus, the risk-seeking policy gradient formulation is general and
can easily be applied to any reinforcement learning environment using any stochastic policy gradient
algorithm trained using batches, e.g. proximal policy optimization (Schulman et al., 2017).
Lastly, in accordance with the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework (Haarnoja
et al., 2018), we provide a bonus to the loss function proportional to the entropy of the sampled
expressions. Pseudocode for DSR is shown in Algorithm 1. Source code is made available at

regression community (White et al., 2013). Each benchmark is deﬁned by a ground truth expression,
a training and test dataset, and a set of allowed operators, described in Table 2 in Appendix D. The
training data is used to compute the reward for each candidate expression, the test data is used to
evaluate the best found candidate expression at the end of training, and the ground truth expression is
used to determine whether the best found candidate expression was correctly recovered.
We compared DSR against ﬁve strong symbolic regression baselines: (1) PQT: an implementation of
our framework trained using priority queue training (Abolaﬁa et al., 2018) in place of the risk-seeking
policy gradient, (2) VPG: a “vanilla” implementation of our framework using the standard policy
gradient (with baseline) in place of the risk-seeking policy gradient, (3) GP: a standard GP-based
symbolic regression implementation (Fortin et al., 2012), (4) Eureqa: popular commercial software3
based on Schmidt & Lipson (2009), the gold standard for symbolic regression, and (5) Wolfram:
commercial software4 based on Markov chain Monte Carlo and nonlinear regression (Fortuna, 2015).
Each baseline is further detailed in Appendix C. Notably, the two RNN-based baselines (PQT and
VPG) differ from DSR only via their training objective, i.e. a supervised objective for PQT and the
standard policy gradient for VPG. All other aspects of our framework (in situ constraints, hierarchical
RNN inputs, constant optimization) are also included for these baselines. While GP can incorporate
post hoc constraints, we found that doing so actually hinders performance (see Appendix F); thus,
they are excluded for GP we exclude all constraints other than the maximum length constraint.
Each experiment consists of 2 million expression evaluations for DSR, PQT, VPG, and GP, by which
point training curves have levelled off. Hyperparameters were tuned on benchmarks Nguyen-7
and Nguyen-10 using a grid search comprising 800 hyperparameter combinations for GP and 81
combinations for each of DSR, PQT, and VPG (see Appendix D for details). Commercial software
algorithms (Eureqa and Wolfram) do not expose hyperparameters and were run until completion.
All experiments were replicated with 100 different random seeds for each benchmark expression.
Wolfram results are only presented for one-dimensional benchmarks because the method is not
applicable to higher dimensions. Additional experiment details are provided in Appendix D. Training
curves are provided in Appendix F.
In Table 1, we report the recovery rate for each benchmark. We use the strictest deﬁnition of recovery:
exact symbolic equivalence, as determined using a computer algebra system, e.g. SymPy (Meurer
et al., 2017). In Table 9 in Appendix F, we report recovery on several additional variants of Nguyen
benchmarks in which we introduced real-valued constants (to demonstrate the constant optimizer) or

all ﬁve baselines in its ability to exactly recover benchmark expressions. In Tables 5–8 in Appendix
E, we compare DSR to literature-reported values from four additional baseline methods (Huynh

density estimate (bandwidth 0.25) of the rewards for a particular training iteration, using either the

training runs. Black plots (A and B) were trained using the risk-seeking policy gradient objective.
Blue plots (C and D) were trained using the standard policy gradient objective. Colorbars indicate

experimental setup (e.g. choice of library, benchmarks, and measure of performance). DSR greatly
outperforms each study’s published results.
Characterizing the risk-seeking policy gradient. The intuition behind the risk-seeking policy
gradient is that it explicitly optimizes for best-case performance, possibly at the expense of average
performance. We demonstrate this visually in Figure 2 by comparing the empirical reward distribu-
tions when trained with either the risk-seeking or standard policy gradient for Nguyen-8. (Analogous
plots for all Nguyen benchmarks are provided in Appendix F.) Interestingly, at the end of training,
the mean reward over the full batch (an estimate of Jstd(θ)) is larger when training with the standard
policy gradient, even though the risk-seeking policy gradient produces larger mean over the top ε
fraction of the batch (an estimate of Jrisk(θ; ε)) and a superior best expression. This is consistent
with the intuition of maximizing best-case performance at the expense of average performance. In
contrast, the best-case performance of the standard policy gradient plateaus early in training (Figure
2E, dashed blue curve), whereas the risk-seeking policy gradient continues to increase until the end
of training (Figure 2E, dashed black curve).
Ablation studies. Algorithm 1 includes several additional components relative to a “vanilla” policy
gradient search. We performed a series of ablation studies to quantify the effect of each of these
components, along with the effects of the various constraints on the search space. In Figure 3, we
show recovery rate for DSR on the Nguyen benchmarks for each ablation. While no single ablation
leads to catastrophic failure, combinations of ablations can cause large degradation in performance.

Noisy data and amount of data. We evaluated the robustness of DSR to noisy data by adding
independent Gaussian noise to the dependent variable, with mean zero and standard deviation
proportional to the root-mean-square of the dependent variable in the training data. In Figure 4,
we varied the proportionality constant from 0 (noiseless) to 10−1 and evaluated each algorithm
(except Wolfram, which catastrophically fails for even the smallest noise level) across all Nguyen
benchmarks. Because expressions can overﬁt to the noise in these experiments, we deﬁned recovery
as exact symbolic equivalence on any expression along the reward-complexity Pareto front at the end
of training (see Appendix D for details). Increasing the dataset size may help prevent overﬁtting by
smoothing the reward function. Thus, we repeated the noise experiments with 10-fold larger training
datasets (Figure 4, dashed lines). For each dataset size, DSR consistently outperforms all baselines.
Performance under reward noise. The risk-seeking policy gradient is derived from a conditional
expectation, and is thus well-justiﬁed for tasks with stochastic rewards. In contrast, PQT assumes
deterministic rewards. Since symbolic regression is a deterministic task, we emulated a stochastic
reward function by adding independent Gaussian noise directly to the reward function: R′(τ) =
R(τ) + N(0, σ). In Figure 5, we compare DSR and PQT performance under increasing reward
noise on benchmark Nguyen-4, a task that is an easier exploitation problem but difﬁcult exploration
problem. As reward noise increases, recovery for PQT heavily relies on exploration and luck, whereas
DSR recovery remains stable even for high reward noise.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We introduce a reinforcement learning approach to symbolic regression that outperforms state-of-the-
art baselines in its ability to recover exact expressions on benchmark tasks. Since both DSR and GP
generate expression trees, there are many opportunities for hybrid methods, for example including
several generations of evolutionary operations within the inner optimization loop. Our framework
includes a ﬂexible distribution over hierarchical, variable-length objects that allows imposing in situ
constraints. Our framework is easily extensible to other domains, which we save for future work; for
example, searching the space of expressions to be used as control policies in reinforcement learning
environments, or searching the space of organic molecular structures for high binding afﬁnity to
a reference compound. Our risk-seeking policy gradient formulation can also be applied to more
traditional reinforcement learning domains; for example, optimizing for a high score (instead of
average score) in Atari video games.

PSEUDOCODE FOR ADDITIONAL ALGORITHMS AND
SUBROUTINES
Pseudocode for sampling an expression from the RNN. The sampling process in DSR (line 4 of
Algorithm 1) is more complicated than typical autoregressive sampling procedures due to applying
constraints in situ and providing hierarchical information to the RNN. Thus, we provide pseudocode
for this process in Algorithm 2. Within this algorithm, the function Arity(τi) simply returns the arity
(number of arguments) of token τi, i.e. two for binary operators, one for unary operators, or zero for
input variables or constants.

▷Compute next parent and sibling
Additional subroutines. DSR includes several subroutines used when sampling an expression from
the RNN and during training. In Subroutine 1, we describe the function ParentSibling(τ) used in
Algorithm 2, which computes the parent and sibling of the next token to be sampled. This subroutine
uses the following logic. If the ﬁnal node in the partial traversal is a unary or binary operator, then
that node is the parent and there is no sibling. Otherwise, the subroutine iterates backward through
the traversal until ﬁnding a node with an unselected child node. That node is the parent and the
subsequent node is the sibling.

12:

In Subroutine 2, we describe the function ApplyConstraints(ψ, L, τ) used in Algorithm 2, which
zeros out the probabilities of tokens that would violate any given constraints. Within this subroutine,
the user-speciﬁc function ViolatesConstraint(τ, Li) returns TRUE if adding the ith token of the library
L to the partial traversal τ would violate any user-speciﬁed constraints, and FALSE otherwise.
In Subroutine 3, we describe the function OptimizeConstants(τ, R) used in Algorithm 1, which
optimizes the placeholder constants ξ of an expression with respect to the reward function using a

the placeholder constants in the expression with the optimized constants ξ⋆.

APPENDIX B
PROOF OF POLICY GRADIENT FOR RISK-SEEKING OBJECTIVE
(PROPOSITION 1)
Tamar et al. (2014) proved the following result for the policy gradient of the ε-conditional value at
risk objective, JCVaR(θ):
∇θJCVaR(θ) .= ∇θEτ∼p(τ|θ) [R(τ) | R(τ) ≤Rε(θ)]
= Eτ∼p(τ|θ) [(R(τ) −Rε(θ)) ∇θ log p(τ|θ) | R(τ) ≤Rε(θ)]
For completeness, we adapt this proof from the CVaR objective to our risk-seeking objective given
in (1). We emphasize that the proof closely follows Tamar et al. (2014). The difference amounts
to deﬁning the threshold Rε as the top ε quantile of rewards (instead of the bottom ε quantile), and
replacing R(τ) ≤Rε in the CVaR objective with R(τ) ≥Rε in our objective. This difference
results in the limits of integration swapping, causing an additional minus sign that eventually cancels
out. Important differences from the proof in Tamar et al. (2014) are colored in red. As in Tamar
et al. (2014), we ﬁrst demonstrate the policy gradient in the single variable case, then extend to the
multivariable case in the reinforcement learning setting. The assumptions follow Assumptions 1 - 7
detailed in Tamar et al. (2014).
Proof. Consider a bounded random variable Z ∈[−b, b] generated from a parameterized distribution
p(Z|θ). The (1 −ε) quantile of Z is:
Q1−ε(Z; θ) = inf{z : CDF(z) ≥1 −ε},
where CDF(z) is the cumulative distribution function corresponding to p(Z|θ). We deﬁne the
risk-seeking objective Jrisk(θ; ε) as the expectation of the ε fraction of the best outcomes of Z:
Jrisk(θ; ε) .= EZ∼p(Z|θ) [Z | Z ≥Q1−ε(Z; θ)]
(2)
We deﬁne Dθ as the set of all values of z above this quantile:
Dθ = {z ∈[−b, b] : z ≥Q1−ε(Z; θ)}
By construction, Dθ is simply the interval [Q1−ε(Z; θ), b], and

p(z|θ)dz = ε

We now compute the gradient of Jrisk(θ; ε) with respect to θ. In the standard policy gradient derivation,
the gradient can be swapped with the integral. In this case, the domain of integration depends on θ,
thus requiring the Leibniz rule:
∇θJrisk(θ; ε) = ∇θ

(4)
We similarly take the gradient of Equation (3):
0 = ∇θ

z∈Dθ
p(z|θ)dz
= ∇θ

Q1−ε(Z;θ)

Plugging Equation (5) into Equation (4) and rearranging yields
∇θJrisk(θ; ε) = 1

Using the “log-derivative trick” (multiplying by p(Z|θ)/p(Z|θ) and using the derivative of a loga-
rithm) and the deﬁnition of conditional expectation yields the ﬁnal result:
∇θJrisk(θ; ε) = 1

The extension to the case in which Z is replaced by a scalar reward function R(τ), where τ is
generated from a parameterized distribution p(τ|θ), follows the proof in Tamar et al. (2014) without
additional adaptation. Thus,
∇θJrisk(θ; ε) = Eτ∼p(τ|θ) [(R(τ) −Rε(θ)) ∇θ log p(τ|θ) | R(τ) ≥Rε(θ)] ,
where Rε(θ) is the (1 −ε)-quantile of the distribution of rewards under the current policy.

DESCRIPTIONS OF BASELINE ALGORITHMS
Priority queue training. The PQT baseline was implemented using our DSR framework (including
in situ constraints, hierarchical RNN inputs, and constant optimization), but replacing the risk-seeking
policy gradient objective with the priority queue training objective proposed in Abolaﬁa et al. (2018).
PQT works by maintaining a priority queue, deﬁned by the top k highest reward samples ever
encountered during training, which is updated each training step. They then deﬁne their training
objective as the average log-likelihood of the samples in the priority queue:
JPQT(θ; k) .= 1
k
k
X
i=1
log p(τ [i]|θ),
14

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
where k is a hyperparameter controlling the size of the priority queue, and τ [i] is the ith member of the
priority queue, i.e. the ith best expression encountered during training. Unlike Jstd(θ) and Jrisk(θ; ε),
the terms in JPQT(θ; k) are not scaled by rewards.
As discussed in Abolaﬁa et al. (2018), the PQT objective can be combined with a policy gradient
objective; however, the authors did not ﬁnd this to improve results relative to PQT only. For this
reason, and to avoid additional hyperparameters, our PQT baseline does not include a policy gradient
term.
Vanilla policy gradient. The VPG baseline was implemented using our DSR framework (including
in situ constraints, hierarchical RNN inputs, and constant optimization), but replacing the risk-seeking
policy gradient objective, Jrisk(θ; ε), with the standard policy gradient objective, Jstd(θ). In addition,
as is common for standard policy gradients, we subtract a baseline from the reward function. As in
Zoph & Le (2017), our baseline is an exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) of rewards.
This introduces a VPG-speciﬁc hyperparameter β, controlling the degree of weighting decrease. Note
that VPG is essentially an ablation of the risk-seeking policy gradient in DSR. However, as it is the
critical ablation, we independently tune hyperparameters for the VPG baseline, in contrast to the “No
risk” ablation in Figure 3.
Genetic programming. GP-based symbolic regression was implemented using the open-source
software package “deap” (Fortin et al., 2012). The initial population of expressions is generated using
the “full” method (Koza, 1992) with depth randomly selected between dmin and dmax. The selection
operator is deﬁned by deterministic tournament selection, in which the expression with the best ﬁtness
among k randomly selected expressions is chosen. The crossover operator is deﬁned by swapping
random subtrees between two expressions. The point mutation operator is deﬁned by replacing a
random subtree with a new subtree initialized using the “full” method with depth randomly selected
between dmin and dmax.
Constraints were implemented in GP in a post hoc manner. Each time a new expression is generated
via mutation or crossover, all constraints are checked. If any constraints are violated, the new
expression is rejected and the evolutionary operation is simply reverted (Fortin et al., 2012; Craenen
et al., 2001). Like the in situ constraints used in DSR, this process reduces the search space; however,
unlike in situ constraints, this rejection-based process introduces a tradeoff between search space
and sample diversity. Thus, we performed all GP hyperparameter grid search both with and without
post hoc constraints (using the same constraints as DSR and the RNN-based baselines). Using the
best hyperparameters found for each mode, we repeated the full recovery rate experiments on the
Nguyen benchmarks, and ultimately selected the best performing mode. We found that constraints
actually hindered performance: GP recovery rate with constraints fell from 60.1% (in Table 1) to
32.3% across the Nguyen benchmarks. Thus, GP results herein do not include constraints other than
constraining the maximum length to 30 (to prevent excessively long expressions with a low chance of
recovery) and the maximum number of constants to 3 (otherwise, runs using constant optimization
can become prohibitively expensive) as in DSR.
Eureqa. Considered to be the gold standard for symbolic regression (Udrescu & Tegmark, 2020),
Eureqa is based on the GP-based approach proposed by Schmidt & Lipson (2009). Eureqa experiments
were run using the DataRobot platform (www.datarobot.com). Eureqa allows the user to select which
tokens to include, and thus experiments used the same library as DSR, as speciﬁed by Table 2 in
Appendix D. While the number of expression evaluations is not tunable or made transparent to the
user, Eureqa allows the user to select among several runtime modes. For all experiments, we used the
longest-running mode, Long Running Search (10,000 Generations). After training,
Eureqa outputs the best found expression based on mean-square error (MSE), as well as the Pareto
front (using a proprietary complexity measure). For noise experiments, to mimic the other baselines,
we checked for exact symbolic equivalence for all solutions along the Pareto front.
Wolfram. Wolfram results were obtained using the Mathematica built-in function FindFormula,
which combines Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods with nonlinear regression (Fortuna,
2015). The function allows the user to specify the set of tokens to include. However, subtraction and
division operators are not allowed. The use of real-valued constants is an integral part of the method
and cannot be deactivated. Therefore, the Wolfram experiments used a slightly different library than
the other algorithms. Speciﬁcally, we used {+, ×, pow, sin, cos, exp, log, x}, where pow(a, b) .= ab.
15

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
Note that a −b can be obtained via a + (−1.0) × b and a ÷ b can be obtained via a × pow(b, −1.0));
thus, all benchmarks can still be recovered using this modiﬁed library.
Notable exclusions. The baselines selected for this work are suitable for searching the space of
tractable mathematical expressions to discover exact symbolic expressions, and can accommodate
numerical constants within expressions. There are several well-known algorithms that do not exhibit
these features, and thus we do not include as baselines:
• Geometric-semantic genetic programming (GSGP): Originally proposed by Moraglio et al.
(2012), GSGP is a GP-based approach that directly searches the space of the semantics
of a program. They do this by constructing geometric semantic operators, which promote
a strict increase in ﬁtness per generation. However, this desirable feature comes with the
cost of the size of the expressions growing exponentially. The resulting expressions are
routinely on the order of trillions of nodes (Pawlak, 2016). This essentially forfeits the
ability to exactly recover expressions, and severely limits the usefulness of the technique for
interpretability—the primary motivation for symbolic regression.
• Equation learner (EQL÷): As discussed in Related Work, Sahoo et al. (2018) perform
symbolic regression via neural networks whose activation functions are elementary operators.
However, the approach precludes the ability to recovery many simple classes of expressions,
such as those involving exponent, logarithm, roots, or division within unary operators.
Further, the resulting expressions can be very long, including real-valued shifts and scaled
for each operator.
• AI Feynman (AIF): As discussed in Related Work, Udrescu & Tegmark (2020) develop
a tool to recursively simplify symbolic regression problems into smaller sub-problems;
solving each sub-problem then requires an inner search algorithm. The authors demonstrate
that many physics equations can be reduced to sub-problems that are solvable using a simple
inner search algorithm, e.g. polynomial ﬁt or small brute-force search. However, more
challenging sub-problems—including many of the benchmark expressions in this work
(namely, those with numerical constants, or those which are non-separable)—still require
an underlying symbolic regression method to conduct the discrete search. Thus, AIF can
be used during pre-processing as a problem-simpliﬁcation step, then combined with any
symbolic regression algorithm. Here, DSR and the baselines tested focus on the underlying
discrete search problem, e.g. after any problem simpliﬁcation steps have been applied.
APPENDIX D
ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT DETAILS
Detailed description of the symbolic regression benchmarks. Details of the benchmark symbolic
regression problems are shown in Table 2. Note that benchmarks without the “const” token in
the library do note use a constant optimizer (line 4 in Algorithm 1, detailed in 3 in Appendix A).
Benchmarks without real-valued constants can be recovered exactly (except Neat-6, discussed in
Appendix E), thus recovery is deﬁned by exact symbolic equivalence. Note that the square root and
power operators are not part of the function set; however, such benchmarks can still be recovered
with the given function set, e.g. Nguyen-8 can still be recovered via exp(
x
x+x log(x)) and Nguyen-11
can still be recovered via exp(y log(x)).
While all algorithms always produce syntactically valid expressions, they do not always produce
semantically meaningful expressions. For example, the expression log(x) is not semantically mean-
ingful for non-positive values of x. Thus, for all non-commercial algorithms, any expression that
produces an overﬂow or other ﬂoating-point error on the input domain is deemed “invalid” and
receives a reward of 0, which corresponds to inﬁnite error. Eureqa and Wolfram follow their own
strategy to deal with this issue.
Hyperparameter selection. Hyperparameters were tuned by performing grid search on benchmarks
Nguyen-7 and Nguyen-10. For each hyperparameter combination, we performed 10 independent
training runs of the algorithm for 1M total expression evaluations. We selected the hyperparameter
combination with the highest average recovery rate, with ties broken by lowest average NRMSE.
For all algorithms, the best found hyperparameters were used for all experiments and all benchmark
expressions.

Conveniently, the three RNN-based algorithms (DSR, PQT, and VPG) each have one unique hy-
perparameter: risk factor ε for DSR, priority queue size k for PQT, and EWMA coefﬁcient β
for VPG. The remaining three hyperparameters considered (batch size, learning rate, and entropy
weight) are present for each algorithm. For these three algorithms, the space of hyperparameters
considered was batch size ∈{250, 500, 1000}, learning rate ∈{0.0003, 0.0005, 0.001}, and entropy
weight λH ∈{0.01, 0.05, 0.1}. For the algorithm-speciﬁc hyperparameters, we considered risk
factor ε ∈{0.05, 0.10, 0.15} for DSR, priority queue size k ∈{5, 10, 20} for PQT, and EWMA
coefﬁcient β ∈{0.1, 0.25, 0.5} for VPG. Thus, these algorithms each considered 81 hyperparameter
combinations. The ﬁnal tuned hyperparameters are listed in Table 3. (Note that hyperparameters
were tuned independently for each algorithm; identical values across algorithms are incidental.)
For GP, the space of hyperparameters considered was population size ∈{100, 250, 500, 1000}, tourna-
ment size ∈{2, 3, 5, 10}, mutation probability ∈{0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15}, crossover probability
∈{0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.90, 0.95}, and post hoc constraints ∈{TRUE, FALSE} (800 combinations).
The ﬁnal tuned hyperparameters are listed in Table 4.

and two “speciﬁcity goal” modes (Low and High). We tested all 6 combinations for 100 random
seeds. Wolfram is not applicable to Nguyen-10, and we found that recovery rate for Nguyen-7 was
0% for all combinations; thus, the best combination of modalities was selected based on benchmarks
Nguyen-5 and Nguyen-6 instead. The best results were obtained using Error for performance and
High for speciﬁcity.

Additional details for constant optimization. The same constant optimizer was used for all non-
commercial software algorithms: DSR, PQT, VPG, and GP. To optimize constants, the values for
constant placeholder tokens are optimized against the reward (or ﬁtness) function using BFGS with an
initial guess of 1.0 for each constant. Before training, we ensured that all benchmarks with constants
do not get stuck in a poor local optimum when optimizing with BFGS and the candidate functional
form is correct. Since numerical constants can only be recovered up to ﬂoating-point precision, for
benchmarks with constants we determined recovery by manually inspecting the functional form for
symbolic correctness. Since constant optimization is a computational bottleneck, we limited each
expression to three constants for all experiments with the “const” token, and ran experiments for
1M expression evaluations instead of 2M. Eureqa and Wolfram follow their own strategy to learn
real-valued constants.
Additional details for ablation studies. In Figure 3, “No risk” denotes using the standard policy
gradient (with baseline) instead of the risk-seeking policy gradient, equivalent to ε = 1. Since
the standard policy gradient typically includes a baseline term, we used an exponentially-weighted
moving average (weight 0.5) of the average reward of the batch. The difference between this ablation
and the VPG baseline is that VPG hyperparameters were tuned independently, whereas this ablation
uses the DSR tuned hyperparameters. “No entropy” denotes no entropy bonus, equivalent to λH = 0.
“No constraints” denotes no constraints precluding nested trigonometric operators, inverse unary
operators, minimum length, or maximum length. Instead, if the maximum length of 30 tokens
is reached, the expression is appended with x until complete. “No risk/ent.” denotes combining
ablations for “No risk” and “No entropy.” “No risk/con.” denotes combining ablations for “No
risk” and “No constraints.” “No ent./con.” denotes combining ablations for “No entropy” and “No
constraints.” “All ablations” denotes combining ablations for “No risk,” “No entropy,” and “No
constraints.”
Pareto front computation. Overﬁtting in symbolic regression occurs when an expression has added
complexity to conform to noisy data. For example, high-degree polynomials can ﬁt small datasets
with low error, though generalization may be poor. While overﬁtting is not an issue for noiseless
experiments (since the global optimal expression has zero error), it is indeed possible for expressions
to overﬁt in the noisy data experiments, especially with small dataset sizes. Thus, for noisy data
18

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
experiments, we deﬁned recovery as exact symbolic equivalence on any expression along the Pareto
front (deﬁned over the reward-complexity plane) at the end of training. To compute the Pareto front,
we deﬁne a simple complexity measure C:
C(τ) =
T
X
i
c(τi),
where c is the complexity of a particular token. In accordance with Eureqa’s default parameters, we
used token complexities of 1 for +, −, ×, input variables, and constants; 2 for ÷; 3 for sin and cos;
and 4 for exp and log.
Note that C is only used to determine the Pareto front at the end of training; it does not affect training.
This method of determining recovery based on the Pareto front was used for all algorithms, except
that Eureqa uses a proprietary complexity measure.
Computing infrastructure. Experiments were executed on an Intel Xeon E5-2695 v4 equipped with
NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs, with 32 cores per node, 2 GPUs per node, and 256 GB RAM per node.
APPENDIX E
COMPARISONS TO LITERATURE-REPORTED RESULTS
Unfortunately, the majority of symbolic regression methods are inconsistent in their experimental
setup, i.e. choice of library, benchmarks, and measure of performance. Often, benchmark expressions
are hand-selected from several benchmark suites (Trujillo et al., 2016) or even hand-crafted for a
particular study (Kusner et al., 2017; Sahoo et al., 2018). The criteria for determining “recovery” (also
called “hit” or “success”) is often deﬁned by an arbitrary error threshold instead of exact symbolic
equivalence (White et al., 2013). Further, different works use different performance metrics (e.g.
RMSE, mean absolute error) that cannot be converted without access to raw data (Jin et al., 2019).
These issues make it difﬁcult to compare methods via direct comparison of literature-reported results.
To enable such comparisons, we mimic the experimental setup and measures of performance for
several works. The alternative approach would be to evaluate these methods using our experimental
setup and measures of performance; however, not all methods have available source code or sufﬁ-
cient implementation details for reproducibility. Below, we recapitulate the experiments of several
additional works, and directly compare literature-reported results to our experiments using DSR. We
note that even these comparisons are imperfect for for benchmarks with randomly sampled points, as
the random number generator and seed used to generate the training and test data are typically not
disclosed.
Semantics-based symbolic regression. Huynh et al. (2016) is an exceptional case in that they also
report recovery as exact symbolic recovery, using an overlapping set of benchmarks: Nguyen-1
through Nguyen-10. In this work, the authors present Semantic-based Symbolic Regression (SSR), a
GP-based approach that considers the semantics of each expression tree; for example, they remove
duplicate trees with different tree structures but identical semantics, e.g. ((((x−1)+(x/x))−x)+y)
is equivalent to y. In Table 5, we compare DSR’s recovery to SSR’s reported values. To replicate their
experimental setup, we report DSR recovery rate for 30 independent training runs. DSR’s average
recovery rate is more than twice as high as SSR.

GrammarVAE. As mentioned in Related Work, Kusner et al. (2017) develop a generative model for
discrete objects that adhere to a pre-speciﬁed grammar, then optimize them in latent space. To mimic
their experimental setup, we run 10 independent trials using the performance metric log(1 + MSE)
and the GrammarVAE benchmark described in Table 2. Using the best solution found in each trial,
DSR’s average performance metric is 0.0105 ± 0.0149, whereas GrammarVAE’s reported average is
orders of magnitude larger: 3.47 ± 0.24. In Table 6, as in Kusner et al. (2017), we compare the top 3
expressions reported in GrammarVAE to the top 3 expressions found using DSR across all 10 trials.
In addition to exactly recovering the expression, DSR’s top 3 expressions are all superior to those
found by GrammarVAE. Further, when repeating for 100 trials, we ﬁnd that DSR exactly recovers
the benchmark expression in 19% of runs, whereas GrammarVAE never exactly recovers the ground
truth expression.

Bayesian Symbolic Regression. In Jin et al. (2019), the authors propose Bayesian symbolic regres-
sion (BSR), a Bayesian framework for symbolic regression. In BSR, several carefully designed
prior distributions are used to encode domain knowledge like preference of basis functions or tree
structure. The resulting posterior distributions are efﬁciently sampled using Markov chain Monte
Carlo techniques. To mimic their experiments, we run 50 independent trials using the performance
metric RMSE and the Jin benchmarks described in Table 2. Table 7 shows the average RMSE on the
test data for DSR and BSR across the benchmarks used in Jin et al. (2019). DSR outperforms BSR
on all six benchmarks.

Neat-GP. In Trujillo et al. (2016), the authors propose Neat-GP, a genetic programming approach
that uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to address the problem
of uncontrolled program size growth in standard GP approaches. The authors report median values of
RMSE on the test data for 30 independent trials using the Neat benchmark set described in Table
2. We replicate their experimental setup using DSR and compare to their reported values in Table 8.
DSR outperforms Neat-GP on seven of the nine benchmarks.
The task in Neat-6 is to ﬁnd closed-form approximations of the harmonic series Hn = Pn
k=1
1
k. As
an additional experiment, we repeated DSR on Neat-6 with {log, const} added to L. DSR discovered
expressions which are remarkably accurate approximations of Hn: when extrapolating to all n ∈N,
the error of the best discovered expression is less than 0.000001%. In particular, DSR discovered the
expression:
Hn ≈γ + log(n) +
1
2n +
1
11.3776 n+15.725 + 0.327981,
where γ ≈0.57721 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. This is a variation of the formula Hn ≈
γ + log(n) + 1/(2n) −1/(12n2) found by Leonhard Euler in 1755 (Bromwich, 1908). Remarkably,
the constant γ naturally emerged in our recovered expression.

ADDITIONAL RESULTS ON NGUYEN BENCHMARKS
Variations of Nguyen benchmarks. We introduce two sets of variations of the Nguyen benchmarks.
In the ﬁrst set, we alter existing benchmarks to make them more challenging. In the second set, we
introduce real-valued constants and add the “const” token to the library to demonstrate the constant
optimizer. We report recovery rate for DSR and all ﬁve baselines in Table 9. DSR signiﬁcantly
outperforms all baselines in the ﬁrst set, and achieves 100% recover in the second set.
Table 9: Recovery rate comparison of DSR and ﬁve baselines on variations of the Nguyen symbolic
regression benchmark suite. A bold value represents statistical signiﬁcance (p < 10−3) across each
set of benchmarks.

NRMSE comparisons. Tables 1 and 9 show recovery rates for all algorithms across all benchmarks.
In Table 10, we show the analogous results for NRMSE on the test data. DSR outperforms all
algorithms across each benchmark set, except Eureqa on the original Nguyen benchmark set. Here,
Eureqa’s lower average NRMSE is attributed to its low error for Nguyen-12. However, this is a result
of not being able to constrain or limit the complexity of expressions produced by Eureqa. In particular,
Eureqa routinely identiﬁed expressions of length ∼100 for Nguyen-12, whereas all non-commercial
baselines were limited to length 30 to ensure that expressions are tractable.
We also observe that for the few expressions with low or zero recovery rate (e.g. Nguyen-7 and
Nguyen-12), GP sometimes exhibits lower NRMSE. One explanation is that GP is more prone to
overﬁtting the expression to the dataset. As an evolutionary approach, GP directly modiﬁes the
previous generation’s expressions, allowing it to make small “corrections” that decrease error each
generation even if the functional form is far from correct. In contrast, in DSR the RNN “rewrites”
each expression from scratch each iteration after learning from a gradient update, making it less prone
to overﬁtting.
Training curves. Figures 6 and 7 show the reward (1/(1+NRMSE)) and recovery rate, respectively,
as a function of total expressions evaluated during training. Commercial software algorithms (Eureqa

APPENDIX G
RUNTIMES OF NON-COMMERCIAL ALGORITHMS
All experiments used an identical number of total evaluation expressions for each method. Another
consideration is the compute time of different methods. In Table 11, we report the average runtimes
(on a single core) for non-commercial algorithms across the Nguyen benchmark set. We report two
runtime metrics: 1) runtime to process all 2M expressions, without early stopping if the benchmark
expression is recovered; 2) runtime until recovering the benchmark expression. Without early
stopping, GP is unsurprisingly the fastest method, as it does not require neural network training.
However, when considering early stopping, DSR is the fastest, largely because it has the highest
recovery rate, thus triggering early stopping more often.

Figure 8: Empirical reward distributions for Nguyen benchmarks, with and without risk-seeking
policy gradients. Each group of four plots corresponds to a particular benchmark expression. Each
curve is a Gaussian kernel density estimate (bandwidth 0.25) of the rewards for a particular training
iteration, using either the full batch of expressions (plots labeled “Full batch”) or the top ε fraction
of the batch (plots labeled “Top ε batch”), averaged over all training runs. Black plots were trained
using the risk-seeking policy gradient objective. Blue plots were trained using the standard policy
gradient objective. Colorbars indicate training step. Triangle markings denote the empirical mean of
the distribution at the ﬁnal training step.

Figure 9: Training curves for all Nguyen benchmarks, with and without risk-seeking policy gradients.
Dotted curves denote mean reward of the full batch. Dashed curves denote mean reward of the top ε
fraction of the batch. Solid curves denote the best expression found so far. Each curve is averaged
over all training runs.
