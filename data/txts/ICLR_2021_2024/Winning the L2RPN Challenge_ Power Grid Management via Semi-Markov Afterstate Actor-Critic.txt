ABSTRACT
Safe and reliable electricity transmission in power grids is crucial for modern
society.
It is thus quite natural that there has been a growing interest in the
automatic management of power grids, exempliﬁed by the Learning to Run a
Power Network Challenge (L2RPN), modeling the problem as a reinforcement
learning (RL) task. However, it is highly challenging to manage a real-world scale
power grid, mostly due to the massive scale of its state and action space. In this
paper, we present an off-policy actor-critic approach that effectively tackles the
unique challenges in power grid management by RL, adopting the hierarchical
policy together with the afterstate representation. Our agent ranked ﬁrst in the
latest challenge (L2RPN WCCI 2020), being able to avoid disastrous situations
while maintaining the highest level of operational efﬁciency in every test scenario.
This paper provides a formal description of the algorithmic aspect of our approach,
as well as further experimental studies on diverse power grids.

INTRODUCTION
The power grid, an interconnected network for delivering electricity from producers to consumers,
has become an essential component of modern society. For a safe and reliable transmission of
electricity, it is constantly monitored and managed by human experts in the control room. Therefore,
there has been growing interest in automatically controlling and managing the power grid. As we
make the transition to sustainable power sources such as solar, wind, and hydro (Rolnick et al.,
2019), power grid management is becoming a very complex task beyond human expertise, calling
for data-driven optimization.
Yet, automatic control of a large-scale power grid is a challenging task since it requires complex yet
reliable decision-making. While most approaches have focused on controlling the generation or the
load of electricity (Venkat et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2020), managing the power
grid through the topology control (changing the connection of power lines and bus assignments in
substations) would be the ultimate goal. By reconﬁguring the topology of the power grid, it can
reroute the ﬂow of electricity, which enables the transmission of electricity from the producers to
consumers efﬁciently and thus prevent surplus production. There are preliminary studies of the
grid topology control in the power systems literature (Fisher et al., 2008; Khodaei & Shahidehpour,
2010), but due to its large, combinatorial, and non-linear nature, these methods do not provide a
practical solution to be deployed to the real-world.
On the other hand, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown signiﬁcant progress in complex
sequential decision-making tasks, such as Go (Silver et al., 2016) and arcade video games (Mnih
et al., 2015), purely from data.
RL is also perceived as a promising candidate to address the
challenges of power grid management (Ernst et al., 2004; Dimeas & Hatziargyriou, 2010; Duan
et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Hua et al., 2019).
In this regard, we present Semi-Markov

Figure 1: An example of a power grid with 4 substations, 2 generators, 2 loads, and 5 lines. Starting
from the left, a bus assignment action at reconﬁgures the grid and then the next state st+1 is
determined by exogenous event et+1, such as the change of power demands in loads. The diagonal
line was experiencing overﬂow, but the action at is shown to revert the overﬂow. The power loss
also reduced from 15 to 13.
Afterstate Actor-Critic (SMAAC), an RL algorithm that effectively tackles the challenges in power
grid management.
One of the main challenges in RL for the real-world scale power grid management lies in its
massive state and action space. We address the problem by adopting a goal-conditioned hierarchical
policy with the afterstate representation. First, we represent state-action pairs as afterstates (Sutton
& Barto, 2018), the state after the agent has made its decision but before the environment has
responded, to efﬁciently cover the large state-action space. The afterstate representation can be
much more succinct than the state-action pair representation when multiple state-action pairs are
leading to an identical afterstate. For example, in the case of controlling the topology of the power
grid, a pair of a current topology and an action of topology modiﬁcation can be represented as a
reconﬁgured topology, since the topology is deterministically reconﬁgured by the action. Then the
next state is determined by random external factors, such as the change of power demands in load.
Second, we extend this idea to a hierarchical framework, where the high-level policy produces a
desirable topology under the current situation, and the low-level policy takes care of ﬁguring out
an appropriate sequence of primitive topology changes. Combined together, our hierarchical policy
architecture with afterstates facilitates effective exploration for good topology during training.
Our algorithm ranked ﬁrst in the latest international competition on training RL agents to manage
power grids, Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) WCCI 2020. In this paper, we further
evaluate our approach using Grid2Op, the open-source power grid simulation platform used in the
competition, by training and testing the agent in 3 different sizes of power grids. We show that the
agent signiﬁcantly outperforms all of the baselines in all grids except for the small grid where the
task was easy for all algorithms.

BACKGROUND
2.1
GRID2OP ENVIRONMENT
We brieﬂy overview Grid2Op, the open-source simulation platform for power grid operation
used in the L2RPN WCCI 2020 challenge.
Grid2Op models realistic concepts found in real-
world operations used to test advanced control algorithms, which follow real-world power system
operational constraints and distributions (Kelly et al., 2020).
The power grid is essentially a graph composed of nodes corresponding to substations that are
connected to loads, generators, and power lines.
The generator produces electricity, the load
consumes electricity, and the power line transmits electricity between substations. The substation
can be regarded as a router in the network, which determines where to transmit electricity. Grid2Op
considers 2 conductors per substation, known as the double busbar system. This means that the
elements connected to a substation, i.e. loads, generators, and power lines, can be assigned to one
of the two busbars, and the power travels only over the elements on the same busbar. Thus, each
substation can be regarded as being split into two nodes.
2

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
The state of the power grid consists of various features such as a topology conﬁguration (the
connectivity of each power line and the bus assignment in each substation), as well as the amount of
power provided by each generator, required by each load, transmitted in each line, and so on. The
power supplied by generators and demanded by loads changes over time, and the power transmitted
in lines also changes according to the current topology conﬁguration together with supply and
demand. In addition, each line has its own capacity to transmit electricity and can be automatically
disconnected when there is an overﬂow of electricity.
The agent can apply actions on substations and lines to managing the power grid. The action on
a substation, called bus assignment, assigns the elements in the substation to a busbar. The action
on a line, called line switch, disconnects (both ends of the line is assigned to neither bus) a line
or reconnects a disconnected line. The agent is allowed to perform one line switch or one bus
assignment action per step, and cannot successively perform actions on the same line or substation.
The power grid is simulated for a given period, typically for several days at a 5-minute interval. The
simulation can terminate prematurely when the agent fails to manage the grid, i.e. (1) the amount
of power required by loads are not delivered, which can happen if there are too many disconnected
lines, or (2) a disconnected subgraph is formed as a result of applying an action. This is reﬂected in
the failure penalty when measuring the performance of the agent, given by the number of remaining
simulation time steps upon termination. Another important performance metric is the power loss
penalty, given by the amount of power that disappeared during transmitting due to resistive loss.
Thus, the goal of the agent is to operate the power grid both safely and efﬁciently by minimizing the
failure penalty and the power loss penalty.
Figure 1 illustrates how the actions affect the state of the power grid using the bus assignment action
as an example. The simulator provides 3 different sizes of power grids, (1) IEEE-5 is the power grid
with 5 substations, (2) IEEE-14 is the power grid with 14 substations, and (3) L2RPN WCCI 2020
is the power grid with 36 substations. See Appendix A.1 for more details on the environment.
2.2
AFTERSTATES IN RL
Grid2Op provides a natural framework to use RL for operating power grids: we assume a Markov
decision process (MDP) deﬁned by (S, A, p, r, γ) to represent the RL task, where S is the state
space, A is the action space, and p(st+1|st, at) is the (unknown) state transition probability, rt =
r(st, at) ∈R is the immediate reward, and γ ∈(0, 1) is the discount factor. We assume learning
a stochastic policy π(at|st), which is a probability distribution over actions conditioned on states.
The state and action value functions under π are V π(s) = Eπ[P
l≥0 γlrt+l|st = s] and Qπ(s, a) =
Eπ[P
l≥0 γlrt+l|st = s, at = a] respectively.
As shown in Figure 1 in the previous section, the transition in Grid2Op comprises two steps: the
topological change that results directly from the action, and then the rest of the state changes that
arise from exogenous events. This motivates the use of the afterstate (Sutton & Barto, 2018),
also known as the post-decision state in Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) (Powell,
2007), which refers to the state after the agent has made its decision but before the arrival of new
information.
Let us deﬁne the state S as (T , X) where T is the part of the state that is deterministically changed
by an action, and X as independent or affected indirectly from an action. Following the modeling
in (Powell, 2007), the transition is decomposed into two parts using f A and f E:
st+1 = [τt+1, xt+1] = f E ([τt+1, xt], et+1) ,
sat
t = [τt+1, xt] = f A ([τt, xt], at) ,
(1)
where τt+1, the deterministic part of st+1, is given by the the function f A(st, at), and xt+1, the
stochastic part, is given by the function f E(sa
t , et+1) where et+1 is the source of the randomness in
the transition sampled from some unknown distribution pE. Note that et+1 itself can be included as
a part in xt+1.
Using the afterstate has a number of advantages. For example, if the state and the action spaces
are very large but the set of unique afterstates is relatively small, learning the value function of
afterstates would be much more efﬁcient. The value of an afterstate sa under policy π is deﬁned as
V π(sa) = Eπ[P
l≥0 γlrt+l|sa = f A(st, at)] and its recursive form can be written as :
V π(sat
t ) = Eet+1∼pE,at+1∼π

r(st, at) + γV π(f A (st+1, at+1))|st+1 = f E(sat
t , et+1)

The optimal afterstate value function and the optimal policy can be obtained by iteratively alternating
between the policy evaluation by Eq. (2) and policy improvement :
πnew(st) = arg max
at

V πold  f A(st, at)

(3)
Note that we cannot gain much from the afterstate representation when using the individual power
grid operations as actions since they result in unique changes in the grid topology. However, we shall
see that the afterstate becomes very powerful when we consider the sequences of grid operations as
the action space, where their permutations result in identical changes in the ﬁnal topology.
3
APPROACH
We ﬁrst present the state space, the action space, and the reward function modeled in our approach.
Then we brieﬂy explain the unique challenge in Grid2Op and describe our approach to tackle the
challenge. Finally, we will describe the overall architecture of the RL agent.
3.1
MODELING STATES, ACTIONS AND REWARDS
State
We also deﬁne the state S in the Grid2Op environment as (T , X) where T is set of topology
conﬁguration (deterministically changed by action) and X as various features as power demands
and supplies (independent of the action), power being transmitted in each line (affected indirectly
from the action) and so on. The detail about the features of states used in this work is provided in
Appendix A.1.
Action
We only consider bus assignment actions in our agent: we assume that it is desirable to
have as many lines connected as possible since the overﬂow is less likely to occur when there are
many routes for the power delivery. Thus, for line switch actions, we simply follow the rule of
always reconnecting the power lines whenever they get disconnected due to the overﬂow.
Let us deﬁne the number of the substation as Nsub and elements in ith substation as Sub(i). Each
end of lines, generators, and loads in the substation can be assigned to one of two busbars, so the
total number of actions is |A| = PNsub
i=0 2Sub(i) (i.e. each action chooses one of the substations
and perform a bus assignment therein). Following the approach taken by the winner of the previous
challenge L2RPN 2019 (Lan et al., 2019), we made our agent act (i.e. intervene) only in hazardous
situations. The condition for being hazardous is determined by the existence of a line in which the
power ﬂow is larger than the threshold hyperparameter. This naturally yields a semi-MDP setting
for RL (Sutton et al., 1999).
Reward
We deﬁne the reward in intermediate time steps to be the efﬁciency of the power grid,
deﬁned by the ratio of the total load to the total production, i.e. loadt
prodt . Note that if the ratio becomes
greater than 1, the episode terminates with a large penalty for the failure since the production does
not meet the demand.
3.2
ACTOR-CRITIC ALGORITHM WITH AFTERSTATES
The main challenge of the Grid2Op environment is the large state and action spaces. For the power
grid with 36 substations used in the L2RPN WCCI 2020 competition, there are about 70,000 actions
that yield unique changes to the topology. We address this problem by adopting the actor-critic
architecture, where the policy and the value function are represented by function approximators.
In addition, we use the afterstate representation to capture many state-action pairs being led to
an identical afterstate by leveraging the transition structure, shown in Figure 1. For notational
simplicity, all the derivations assume MDP in this section, which shall be extended to the semi-
MDP setting in the next section.
We use function approximators for the afterstate value function Vψ(sat
t ) and policy πθ(at|st)
parameterized by ψ and θ respectively. The actor is trained to maximize Jπ and the critic to minimize
LV :
Jπ(θ) = Est∼D,at∼πθ(·|st)

2i
(5)
where the replay buffer D stores the transition tuple [st, sat
t , r(st, at), st+1] for off-policy learning.
The actor and the critic are trained using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018). Note that
it learns a value function over an afterstate with a reconﬁgured topology, rather than a state-action
pair, which is more succinct. Although the above equation deﬁnes a state-value critic, we can still
train off-policy since it is essentially an action-value critic (i.e. an afterstate is deﬁned by a state and
an action).
Furthermore, we aim to apply the gradient estimator through a reparameterization trick similar to
Haarnoja et al. (2018), since it is known to have lower variance than the likelihood ratio gradient
estimator, resulting in stable learning. In order to update the actor via reparameterization trick, the
transition f A must be differentiable, but it is not straightforward to deﬁne f A, which maps from
the bus assignment actions to the topology conﬁgurations, as a differentiable formula. In the next
section, we will mitigate the problem by re-deﬁning the action space.
3.3
EXTENSION TO GOAL-CONDITIONED HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK
It is very challenging to take exploratory actions in the Grid2Op environment: if the agent takes
random actions, the power grid would fail in a few time steps.
For example, the agent with
the random policy would mostly fail in less than 10 time steps, whereas the agent with the no-
op policy (naively maintaining the initial grid topology throughout time steps) would survive
approximately 500 time steps on average. Thus, it is very difﬁcult for the agent to explore diverse
grid topology conﬁgurations that are signiﬁcantly different from the initial ones, and thereby the
random exploration policy (e.g. ϵ-greedy) would be often stuck at bad local optima that executes
only one or two actions. Therefore, a more structured exploration is a key to successful training.
To this end, we extend the afterstate actor-critic algorithm to a two-level hierarchical decision model
by deﬁning the goal topology conﬁguration as the high-level action. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the high-
level actions as the goal topology conﬁguration g ∈{0, 1}n where n = PNsub
i=0 Sub(i), which is
learned by the high-level policy πh. This leads to the temporally extended afterstate representation,
given by sgt
t
= [τt+d = gt, xt] = f A([τt, xt], gt) where t denotes the time a hazard occurs and
d denotes the time interval next hazard occurs. Note that we can now take full advantage of the
afterstate representation since the equivalence of many different sequences of primitive actions (i.e.
individual bus assignment actions) that lead to the identical topology are now captured by the goal
topology conﬁguration.
In addition, exploration with goal topology is more effective than with primitive actions since the
policy only needs to focus on where to go, i.e. the desirable topology under the current situation,
without needing to care about how to get there, i.e. ﬁguring out a suitable primitive action sequence
that would yield the goal topology, with the help from an appropriate low-level policy. Finally, we
can now use the reparameterization trick for the actor update in a straightforward manner since the
result of f A is merely a copy of the action gt.
The replay buffer D stores the transition tuple, [st, gt, rt:t+d, st+d] where rt:t+d = Pt+d
t′=t γt′−trt′.
The high-level policy can be trained through the objective function of the actor and the critic written
as:
Jπ(θ) = Egt∼πh
θ [Vψ ([gt, xt])]
(6)
JV (ψ) = ED

Vψ(sgt
t ) −rt:t+d −γdEgt+d∼πh
θ [Vψ([gt+d, xt+d])]
2
(7)
As for the low-level policy, it is relatively simple to ﬁnd the action sequence that changes the
current topology into the goal topology: we just need to identify the set of substations that requires
changes in the bus assignment and make appropriate reassignments therein. Thus, we take a rule-
based approach for the low-level policy, at = πl
rule(st, gt) where the rule determines the order
of substations to execute bus assignment actions. For example, we could impose a priority on
substations such that the substations with the least room in the capacity make their bus reassignment
ﬁrst because they are the ones requiring the most urgent interventions. In the experiments section,
we compare the results using various rules including a learning-based approach.

topology gt given the current state st = [τt, xt], and the critic layer outputs the afterstate value given
the afterstate sgt
t = [gt, xt].
3.4
IMPLEMENTATION
In order to leverage the interconnection structure of the power grid, we apply graph neural networks
(GNN) (Scarselli et al., 2008). As illustrated in Figure 2, given the power grid with n substations,
we reshape xt in the state st = [τt, xt], given as a ﬂat vector in Grid2Op, into (M, ˜xt), where
M ∈{0, 1}n×n is the adjacency matrix, and ˜xt ∈Rn×k is the node matrix with k features. We
adopted the transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as the GNN block, where the adjacency matrix M is
used for masking out the attention weights of nodes, following the architecture proposed by Parisotto
et al. (2020). The actor and the critic share the lower layers, consisting of GNN blocks and linear
layers. Additionally, we add an entropy of policy to the objective function of the actor and the critic,
following the SAC formulation. Details of the architecture are provided in Appendix A.2.

RELATED WORKS
The topology control of the power grid through line switch has been previously studied in the power
systems literature. Previous works, Fisher et al. (2008) and Khodaei & Shahidehpour (2010), solve
the optimal transmission switching problem by mixed-integer programming. Since then, several
heuristics have been introduced to tackle the computational cost (Fuller et al., 2012; Dehghanian
et al., 2015; Alhazmi et al., 2019). Recently, Marot et al. (2018) explores bus assignment, more
complex than the line switch, and presents an algorithm based on expert knowledge, which shows
the utility of bus assignment. Their algorithm can ﬁnd remedial bus assignment action that can
revert overﬂow with a high probability of success and acceptable computational time. Han (2020)
explores bus and line separation to solve the problem of short circuit current reduction in power
systems through RL. Marot et al. (2020) models the power grid management through line switch
and bus assignment as a RL task and releases an open-source simulation called Grid2Op for power
grid management in multi-step time horizons. Additionally, they held the international power grid
management competition, L2RPN 2019 challenge, where IEEE-14 is chosen for the competition
environment, and Subramanian et al. (2020) present a simple deep RL approach for IEEE-14.
The winner of the L2RPN 2019 challenge (Lan et al., 2019) tackles the problem through pre-
training and guided exploration. They collect massive data sets from the simulator which can restore
particular states, and pre-train an agent to generate a good initial policy. For exploration in the large
action space, they use guided exploration instead of random exploration, where the agent simulates
the top few actions with high action values before performs its action to the environment at every
time step. They also design the agent to act only in hazardous situations, and they train it using
dueling Deep Q-Networks (DQN) (Wang et al., 2016) and prioritized replay buffer (Schaul et al.,
2016).

The afterstate representation has been applied to address the resource allocation problems and
dynamic routing problems. Singh & Bertsekas (1996) formulate the dynamic channel allocation
problem in the cellular network as a dynamic programming problem using the afterstate value
function. More recently, there has been research on utilizing the afterstate representation combined
with ADP in a dynamic vehicle routing problem (Agussurja et al., 2019; Ulmer et al., 2019). Shah
et al. (2020) also apply an afterstate-based deep RL method in a ride-pool matching problem. The
hierarchical framework has long held the promise to tackle complex RL tasks (Dayan & Hinton,
1992; Parr & Russell, 1998; Barto & Mahadevan, 2003), and especially one of the prevailing
approaches, the goal-conditioned hierarchical framework has recently achieved signiﬁcant success
in various tasks, such as simulated and real-world quadrupedal manipulation (Nachum et al., 2018a;
2020) and complex navigation (Levy et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). However, to the best of our
knowledge, none of the works combines the afterstate representation with a hierarchical framework.
GNN has been widely used in deep RL to directly tackle graph-structured problems or to represent
the interaction between entities in a state.
You et al. (2018) formulates goal-directed graph
generation as MDP and solves designing a molecular structure with speciﬁc desired properties
problem through an RL algorithm.
Wang et al. (2018) apply GNN for continuous control by
modeling controllable joints as nodes for a graph, and the physical dependencies between joints
as edges to capture underlying graph structure. Zambaldi et al. (2019) adopt GNN for a navigation
and planning task where complex relational reasoning is required to represent pairwise interactions
between objects in a state, and Jiang et al. (2020) adopt it for learning cooperation in multi-agent
environments by modeling agents as nodes in a graph where they communicate through GNN.

EXPERIMENTS
5.1
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Our experiments are conducted on the 3 power grids, IEEE-5 (smallest), IEEE-14, and L2RPN
WCCI 2020 (largest, used in the challenge), provided by Grid2Op. Details of each grid are provided
in Table 1.
Each grid has a set of scenarios, and each scenario speciﬁes the variations in the
simulation such as the power supplies and demands at each time step. The length of each scenario
is 864 time steps, which corresponds to 3 days at 5 minute time-resolution.
Since Grid2Op is relatively new to the research community, there are few RL methods applied to
the grid topology control. Therefore we implement 3 baselines for performance comparison to
verify the effectiveness of our method: (1) DDQN (Dueling DQN) has similar architecture as the
last winner of the challenge, which learns the action-value function with the primitive action space
(2) SAC is similar to DDQN but utilizes maximum entropy exploration following SAC algorithm.
(3) SMAAC\AS is SMAAC without the afterstate representation, where we use action-value critic
Qπ(s, g). Thus, DDQN and SAC assume the MDP setting with primitive actions, SMAAC\AS
assumes the goal-conditioned semi-MDP setting but without the afterstate representation.
We
additionally compare our approach with the 3rd placed participant in the L2RPN WCCI 2020
grid,1 (4) YZM, the only agent with publicly available code. This agent heuristically selects 596
actions among the primitive actions in prior and trains the agent with the reduced action space using
Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (Mnih et al., 2016). YZM additionally trains a backup agent
1Their algorithm is designed speciﬁcally for L2RPN WCCI 2020 grid and cannot be applied to other grids.

or termination by using the simulation function.2
For a fair comparison, all baselines except for YZM encode the input state through the same GNN
architecture, and the agents get activated only in hazardous situations. The detail of implementation
is provided in Appendix A.3 and the code is provided in https://github.com/sunghoonhong/SMAAC.

RESULTS
Figure 3 shows the total average scaled score of evaluation rollouts on the 10 validation scenario
set during training: the scores are scaled in the range [-100,100], with the return of the no-op agent
scaled and translated to 0, indicating how better the agent manages the power grid than the no-op
agent in terms of safety and power efﬁciency. Each algorithm was trained and evaluated for 3 runs
for averaging the scores.
As shown in Figure 3, all algorithms easily solve the smallest grid (IEEE-5). In the medium (IEEE-
14) and the large (L2RPN WCCI 2020) grids, both DDQN and SAC perform poorly.
DDQN
performs slightly better than the no-op agent in the medium grid and worse than the no-op agent
in the largest grid. Exploring with primitive actions is extremely difﬁcult since most actions can
lead to disastrous termination, and thereby it cannot ﬁnd grids other than the initial one. This yields
the DDQN to be stuck at bad local optima, not much better than the no-op agent. SAC performs
slightly better than DDQN in the larger grids. This is due to the sophisticated optimization scheme
in SAC that is shown to affect a number of other RL benchmark tasks. However, in Grid2Op, the
performance was barely better than the no-op agent due to the same challenge faced by DDQN.
Perhaps surprisingly, the performance of SMAAC\AS is no better than using primitive actions,
although the hierarchical decision encourages deviating from the initial topology.
Without the
afterstate representation, the critic was not able to learn a good action-value function due to the
massive state and action spaces. YZM uniquely leverages the simulation function and can show
good performance from the beginning. However, exploring primitive actions is still hard even with
2The simulation function is a predeﬁned method in Grid2Op, which returns a next state given an action
through an approximate simulation.

The performance on the test scenarios is provided in Table 2. We provide a qualitative analysis of
how each agent behaves differently and how SMAAC remedies the hazardous power grid with a
detailed example in Appendix A.4.
On the contrary, our method learns signiﬁcantly fast and outperforms all the baselines, effectively
combining the beneﬁts of the hierarchical decision model and the afterstate representation. Finally,

Figure 4: Comparison of 4 rules.
In this section, we examine how the low-level policy affects the
overall performance. (1) FIXED gives priority to substations
randomly that are predeﬁned and ﬁxed during training.
We
implement this low-level agent to ﬁnd out whether our high-
level agent can manage the power network on the poor low-
level agent. (2) CAPA gives high priority to substations with
lines under high utilization of their capacity, which applies an
action to substations that require urgent care. (3) DESC imposes
a priority on large substations, i.e. many connected elements. A
change to a large substation can be seen as making a large change
in the overall topology with a single action. (4) OPTI optimizes
execution order by training, making the actor additionally output
Nsub values that represents the priority of substations. All rules
achieve similar performance with overlapped conﬁdence intervals except for FIXED.
As shown in Figure 4, especially, CAPA converges fast compared to OPTI and DESC, hence we
use this low-level agent in Section 5.2. We assume that most of the rules could achieve similar ﬁnal
performances since SMAAC is resilient to suboptimal low-level rules. By generating subgoals that
include a subset of intended topology reconﬁguration, the high-level policy can adapt to suboptimal
low-level rules to form an optimal policy overall. However, as the result of FIXED suggests, a very
poorly designed low-level policy can lead to instability and degrade the performance.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented SMAAC, a deep RL approach demonstrated to be very effective for power
grid management. SMAAC is an actor-critic algorithm that combines the afterstate representation
with a hierarchical decision model. This is very important for power grid management modeled
by Grid2Op, where actions are too primitive for effective exploration and many permutations of
action sequences lead to identical changes in the power grid topology. Besides, naive explorations
with primitive actions are subject to immediate failure due to the unique nature of power grid
management. We empirically demonstrated that the presented method signiﬁcantly outperforms
several baselines in the real-world scale power grids, and ranked ﬁrst in the latest international
competition, L2RPN WCCI 2020 challenge. Our work shows the possibility of an intelligent agent
that automatically operates the power grid for several days without expert help.

APPENDIX
A.1
ENVIRONMENT DETAIL
Grid2Op provides a simulation for power grid operation in real-time over several days at a 5-minute
time-resolution. There are 3 power grids, IEEE-5, IEEE-14, and L2RPN WCCI 2020 (a subgraph
of IEEE-118), where each has different size.
State Space
The state of the power grid consists of 12 features presented in Table 4. We use
5 features provided by the environment and 1 feature deﬁned by us, which we consider enough
to represent the current state of the grid; Active power, rho, topology conﬁguration, time step
overﬂow, maintenance, hazard. The maintenance is a boolean vector representing whether a line
is in maintenance, and the hazard represent is also a boolean vector representing whether electricity
ﬂows of a line is larger than a predeﬁned threshold δh. We use 0.9 for the threshold, and this
threshold is same as the one we used for the hazardous state.
Further details are provided in
grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/observation.html
Action Space
The agent can apply actions on substations and lines to manage the power grid. The
action on a substation, called bus assignment, assigns the elements in the substation to a busbar. The
action on a line, called line switch, disconnects (both ends of line is assigned to neither bus) a line
or reconnects a disconnected line. Let us deﬁne the number of lines in the power grid as Nline, the
number of substations as Nsub, and the number of elements in ith substation as Sub(i). Then at
each time step the agent selects an action at from the action space A where |A| = Nline + 22 ×
Nline + PNsub
i=0 2Sub(i). 3
Rule
There are some rules that make the task more realistic and challenging in Grid2Op. Lines
can be automatically disconnected due to overﬂow of current, i.e. if more current ﬂows than a
line can hold for 3 time steps, a line is automatically disconnected. There is cooldown time for
each component, i.e. the agent cannot apply its action to the same component successively and it
is reactivated after 3 time steps later. There is a stochastic event called maintenance that happens
intermittently. During maintenance, a line is disconnected by force and it cannot be reconnected.
Score
The performance of an agent can be evaluated by a score which consists of power loss
penalty, failure penalty, and redispatching penalty. It is deﬁned as :
Score =
tover
X
t=0
(prodt −loadt) +
tend
X
t=tover
penalty +
tover
X
t=0
redispatcht
(8)
where tover is the time game over occurs, prodt is total amount of power supply by all generators,
loadt is total amount of power demand by loads. prodt−loadt stands for total amount of power loss.
The failure penalty is given by the sum over the large constant penalty for the remaining simulation
time steps upon termination. The redispatching penalty is incurred when the agent do redispatching
action, which controls generators to produce more or less electricity. Since redispatching action
always incurs the additional penalty, we do not consider this action, so the redispatching penalty is
always 0 in our case. Therefore, the goal of the agent is to operate the power grid both safely and
efﬁciently by minimizing the failure penalty and the power loss penalty.
A.2
MODEL ARCHITECTURE
Given the state s = [τ, x], we reshape x into (M, ˜x), where M ∈{0, 1}n×n is the adjacency matrix,
and ˜x ∈Rn×k is the node matrix with k features. The shared layers consisted of Ls GNN blocks
that computes the node embedding of an input graph through transformer layers at their beginning.
Given input nodes matrix ˜x, a linear layer with ReLU activation increases input dimension k to
embedding dimension ks, which maps ˜x ∈Rn×d to H0 ∈Rn×ks. After the linear layer, Ls
3Both ends of the line can be assigned to one of two buses in the substation, so 22 × Nline is the number
of reconnection. Each end of the line, generator, and load in the substation also can be assigned to one of two
buses in the substation, so bus switching actions are PNsub
i=0 2Sub(i)

Table 4: Details of features in the state
transformer layers follow. The input of the transformer block at the lth block is an embedding from
the previous layer Hl−1 and the adjacency matrix A, Hl = Transformer(Hl−1, A).
The actor’s head consists of La transformer blocks and 2 linear layers.
Given the ﬁnal node
embedding HLe from the shared layers, the transformer layers in actor’s head takes it as the input
and outputs node embedding HLa ∈Rn×ka. The ﬁrst linear layer transforms 2D node embedding
HLa to a vector node embedding Rn by reducing the embedding dimension ka to 1, which is then
concatenated with the current topology τ to form the state s and the next linear layers outputs
mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution. We sample continuous values g′ ∈Rn
from the normal distribution followed by tanh non-linearity and the desirable topology g ∈{0, 1}n
is constructed by assigning 1 to values in g′ larger than predeﬁned topology threshold δτ and 0
otherwise. We empirically ﬁnd out that an agent without the threshold has difﬁculty learning in the
large grid. However, an appropriate threshold helps stable learning and fast convergence.
The critic’s head has a similar structure except for linear layers. There are Lc GNN blocks in the
critic that also takes HLe and outputs HLc ∈Rn×kc. After transforming it into a vector node
embedding Rn by a linear layer, g′ is concatenated to HLc, and the following two linear layers take
it as the input and outputs a scalar value. The overall architecture is shown in the Figure 2.
Although the agent observes all substations, we reduce the goal dimension n to ˜n by restricting
controllable substation. As we mentioned in subsection 3.1, we do not consider disconnection or
reconnection. Therefore, the agent only controls substations that have more than 2 elements since
there are only two possible cases, elements on a same bus (connection) or elements on a different
bus (disconnection). For L2RPN WCCI 2020 grid, the agent acts on substations that have more than
5 elements in order for fast convergence. As a result, the goal dimension is reduced from 21 to 16
in IEEE-5, from 57 to 42 in IEEE-14, and from 177 to 79 in L2RPN WCCI 2020.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
For all models, we use 6 state features, active power, rho, topology conﬁguration, time step overﬂow,
maintenance, and hazard, where δh = 0.9. All the agent acts only when there is a rho of a line,
ratio between current ﬂow and thermal limit that is capacity of a line, is larger than the δh = 0.9.
Additionally the last 6 states of a history are stacked to represent the input state, since the difference
between the state at time step t and t + 1 is not signiﬁcantly different in Grid2Op. Since the ﬁrst
decimal place of reward does not change signiﬁcantly ( loadt
prodt varies from 0.85 to 0.99 most of time),
we transform it as ( loadt
prodt ×10−9)×0.1 to use the second decimal place. Adam optimizer (Kingma
& Ba, 2015) is used for training with 5e−5 learning rate and 128 batch size. We perform grid search
to ﬁnd the best hyperparameters for each model.
SMAAC
SMAAC is our proposed model, which learns the afterstate value function on the goal
space, namely topology conﬁguration space.
We use Ls = 6 GNN blocks with embedding
dimension ks = 64/128 for shared layers. For actor’s head, we use La = 3 GNN blocks with
embedding dimension ka = 64/128. For critic’s head, we use Lc = 1 GNN block with embedding
dimension kc = 64/128 followed by linear layers with kc+˜n
4
hidden units. We use δτ = 0/0.1/0.15.
In practice, the reward for the high-level policy in Equation 6 is not discounted, rt:t+d = Pt+d
t′=t rt′
and γ is used instead of γd following Nachum et al. (2018b). For the competition, we use ks = 128,
kc = 128, ka = 128, δτ = 0.35, and τ is used as an extra input feature for the shared layers.
SMAAC\AS
SMAAC\AS is a baseline, which learns the action-value function of desired relative
change in hierarchical framework. The overall architecture is similar to SMAAC, but the critic
takes both desired relative change and topology conﬁguration to learn on state-action pairs. We use
δτ = 0/0.1/0.15.
SAC
SAC is a baseline, which learns the action-value function on the primitive bus assignment
action space. We use Ls = 6 GNN blocks with embedding dimension ks = 64/128 for shared
layers. For actor’s head, we use La = 3 GNN blocks with embedding dimension ka = 64/128. And,
we use softmax to output categorical distribution while utilize relaxed categorical distribution in
training. For critic’s head, we use Lc = 1 GNN block with embedding dimension kc = 32/64/128
followed by concatenation with one-hot encoded action and one linear layer.
DDQN
DDQN is a baseline, which learns the action-value function on the primitive bus
assignment action space. It does not have separate actor but critic outputs |A| action-values. We
use Ls = 6 GNN blocks with embedding dimension ks = 64/128 for embedding layers. Following
it, the critic has Lc = 1 GNN blocks with embedding dimension ks = 64/128. Then, it utilizes the
technique used by dueling DQN, namely we compute action-values through both value network and
advantage network.

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
In this section, we present qualitative analysis based on example behaviors of agents. Figure 5
indirectly shows how each agent behaves in 2 grids. In the medium grid, after our agent reaches
to the certain grid, it keeps staying in that grid. We speculate that the agent ﬁnds the optimal grid
during training where electricity could distribute evenly all the time so no further actions required. It
is reasonable in Grid2Op where a single action can potentially destroy the grid. On the other hand, it
shows different behavior in the large grid. It changes the topology conﬁguration diversely to revert
the hazardous situations since the agent cannot ﬁnd the grid such as the one in the medium grid.
SAC, which shows the best performance among the baselines, only changes a few of the topology
conﬁguration by executing only one or two actions in both grids, since the initial topology is strong
local optima in Grid2Op. DDQN also shows similar behavior, but it shows worse performance than
the SAC, since it changes the initial grid more. Likewise, SMAAC\AS that changes the topology
the most shows the worst performance. It is extremely difﬁcult to ﬁnd the better topology than the
initial one in Grid2Op without the effective exploration. The efﬁcient learning together with the
effective exploration is the key to successful management.
We further examine how SMAAC learned to revert a hazardous state back to the safe state. As
shown in Figure 6, the line 4-5 (between substation 4 and 5) in t is in the hazardous situation. At
time step t + 1, our agent makes bus assignment change in the substation 12 by assigning line 12-13
to yellow busbar. As a result, some amount of electricity that ﬂows in the line 4-5 moves to line 4-3
to meet the load demand in the substation 13 where electricity is supplied only from the line 8-13
due to the action in t + 1. Then the last action at t + 2 that changes the substation 3 further disperses
electricity from the substation 4. In the end, a more balanced distribution is achieved.
A.5
ACTIVATION OF THE AGENT
As we mentioned in subsection 3.1, the agent acts only in hazardous situations, i.e. there is a
line of which usage rate (ratio between current ﬂow and thermal limit) is larger than the threshold
hyperparameter δh. Note that the usage rate larger than 1.0 implies that a line is overﬂowed.
17

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021
Table 5 shows how the ﬁnal performance changes according to δh in the test scenarios. If δh is
too high, e.g. δh = 1.1, the agent may not be able to recover from the hazardous situation, and
show relatively worse performance. On the other hand, the agent with δh = 0.8 faces more diverse
situations, requiring far more samples to reach the performance of the other agents with higher δh.
