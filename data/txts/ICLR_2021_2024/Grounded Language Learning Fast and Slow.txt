ABSTRACT
Recent work has shown that large text-based neural language models acquire a
surprising propensity for one-shot learning. Here, we show that an agent situated
in a simulated 3D world, and endowed with a novel dual-coding external mem-
ory, can exhibit similar one-shot word learning when trained with conventional
RL algorithms. After a single introduction to a novel object via visual perception
and language (“This is a dax”), the agent can manipulate the object as instructed
(“Put the dax on the bed”), combining short-term, within-episode knowledge of
the nonsense word with long-term lexical and motor knowledge. We ﬁnd that, un-
der certain training conditions and with a particular memory writing mechanism,
the agent’s one-shot word-object binding generalizes to novel exemplars within
the same ShapeNet category, and is effective in settings with unfamiliar numbers
of objects. We further show how dual-coding memory can be exploited as a signal
for intrinsic motivation, stimulating the agent to seek names for objects that may
be useful later. Together, the results demonstrate that deep neural networks can ex-
ploit meta-learning, episodic memory and an explicitly multi-modal environment
to account for fast-mapping, a fundamental pillar of human cognitive development
and a potentially transformative capacity for artiﬁcial agents.

INTRODUCTION
Language models that exhibit one- or few-shot learning are of growing interest in machine learn-
ing applications because they can adapt their knowledge to new information (Brown et al., 2020;
Yin, 2020). One-shot language learning in the physical world is also of interest to developmental
psychologists; fast-mapping, the ability to bind a new word to an unfamiliar object after a single
exposure, is a much studied facet of child language learning (Carey & Bartlett, 1978). Our goal is
to enable an embodied learning system to perform fast-mapping, and we take a step towards this
goal by developing an embodied agent situated in a 3D game environment that can learn the names
of entirely unfamiliar objects in a single exposure, and immediately apply this knowledge to carry
out instructions based on those objects. The agent observes the world via active perception of raw
pixels, and learns to respond to linguistic stimuli by executing sequences of motor actions. It is
trained by a combination of conventional RL and predictive (semi-supervised) learning.
We ﬁnd that an agent architecture consisting of standard neural network components is sufﬁcient
to follow language instructions whose meaning is preserved across episodes. However, learning
to fast-map novel names to novel objects in a single episode relies on semi-supervised prediction
mechanisms and a novel form of external memory, inspired by the dual-coding theory of knowl-
edge representation (Paivio, 1969). With these components, an agent can exhibit both slow word
learning and fast-mapping. Moreover, the agent exhibits an emergent propensity to integrate both
fast-mapped and slowly acquired word meanings in a single episode, successfully executing in-
structions such as “put the dax in the box” that depend on both slow-learned (“put”, “box”) and
fast-mapped (“dax”) word meanings.
Via controlled generalization experiments, we ﬁnd that the agent is reasonably robust to a degree of
variation in the number of objects involved in a given fast-mapping task at test time. The agent also
exhibits above-chance success when presented with the name for a particular object in the ShapeNet

taxonomy (Chang et al., 2015) and then instructed (using that name) to interact with a different
exemplar from the same object class, and this propensity can be further enhanced by speciﬁc meta-
training. We ﬁnd that both the number of unique objects observed by the agent during training and
the temporal aspect of its perceptual experience of those objects contribute critically to its ability to
generalize, particularly its ability to execute fast-mapping with entirely novel objects. Finally, we
show that a dual-coding memory schema can provide a more effective basis to derive a signal for
intrinsic motivation than a more conventional (unimodal) memory.

AN ENVIRONMENT FOR FAST WORD LEARNING
We conduct experiments in a 3D room built with the Unity game engine. In a typical episode, the
room contains a pre-speciﬁed number N of everyday 3D rendered objects from a global set G. In
all training and evaluation episodes, the initial positions of the objects and agent are randomized.
The objects include everyday household items such as kitchenware (cup, glass), toys (teddy bear,
football), homeware (cushion, vase), and so on.
Episodes consist of two phases: a discovery phase, followed by an instruction phase (see Figure 1).1
In the discovery phase, the agent must explore the room and ﬁxate on each of the objects in turn.
When it ﬁxates on an object, the environment returns a string with the name of the object (which
is a nonsense word), for example “This is a dax” or “This is a blicket”. Once the environment has
returned the name of each of the objects (or if a time limit of 30s is reached), the positions of all
the objects and the agent are re-randomized and the instruction phase begins. The environment then
emits an instruction, for example “Pick up a dax” or “Pick up a blicket”. To succeed, the agent must
then lift up the speciﬁed object and hold it above 0.25m for 3 consecutive timesteps, at which point
the episode ends, and a new episode begins with a discovery phase and a fresh sample of objects
from the global set G. If the agent ﬁrst lifts up an incorrect object, the episode also ends (so it is not
possible to pick up more than one object in the instruction phase). To provide a signal for the agent
to learn from, it receives a scalar reward of 1.0 if it picks up the correct object in the instruction
phase. In the default training setting, to encourage the necessary information-seeking behaviour, a
smaller shaping reward of 0.1 is provided for visiting each of the objects in the discovery phase.
Given this two-phase episode structure, two distinct learning challenges can be posed to the agent.
In a slow-learning regime, the environment can assign the permanent name (e.g. “cup”, “chair”)
to objects in the environment whenever they are sampled. By contrast, in the fast-mapping regime,
1Rendered images are higher resolution than those passed to the agent.
2

which is the principal focus of this work, the environment assigns a unique nonsense word to each
of the objects in the room at random on a per-episode basis. The only way to consistently solve the
task is to record the connections between words and objects in the discovery phase, and apply this
(episode-speciﬁc) knowledge in the instruction phase to determine which object to pick up.

MEMORY ARCHITECTURES FOR AGENTS WITH VISION AND LANGUAGE
The agents that we consider build on a standard architecture for reinforcement learning in multi-
modal (vision + language) environments (see e.g. (Chaplot et al., 2018; Hermann et al., 2017; Hill
et al., 2020)). The visual input (raw pixels) is processed at every timestep by a convolutional network
with residual connections (a ResNet). The language input is passed through an embedding lookup
layer plus self-attention layer for processing. Finally, a core memory integrates the information
from the two input sources over time. A fully-connected plus softmax layer maps the state of this
core memory to a distribution over 46 actions, which are discretizations of a 9-DoF continuous
agent avatar. A separate layer predicts a value function for computing a baseline for optimization
according to the IMPALA algorithm (Espeholt et al., 2018).
We replicated previous studies by verifying that a baseline architecture with LSTM core memory
(Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) could learn to follow language instructions when trained in the
slow-learning regime. However, the failure of this architecture to reliably learn to perform above-
chance in the fast-learning regime motivated investigation of architectures involving explicit external
memory modules. Given the two observation channels from language and vision, there are various
ways in which observations can be represented and retrieved in external memory.
Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)
In the DNC (Wayne et al., 2018), at each timestep t a
latent vector et = w(ht−1, rt−1, xt), computed from the previous hidden state ht−1 of the agent’s
core memory LSTM, the previous memory read-out rt−1, and the current inputs xt, is written to
a slot-based external memory. In our setting, the input xt is a simple concatenation [vt, lt] of the
output of the vision network and the embedding returned by the language network. Before writing
to memory, the latent vector et is also passed to the core memory LSTM to produce the current state
ht. The agent reads from memory by producing a query vector q(ht) and read strength β(ht), and
computing the cosine similarity between the query and all embeddings currently stored in memory
ei (i < t). The external memory returns only the k most similar entries in the memory (where
k is a hyperparameter), and corresponding scalar similarities. The returned embeddings are then
aggregated into a single vector ˆrt by normalizing the similarities and taking a weighted average of
the embeddings. This reading procedure is performed simultaneously by n independent read heads,
and the results [ˆr1
t, . . . , ˆrn
t ] are concatenated to form the current memory read-out rt. The vectors
et and ht are output to the policy and value networks.
Dual-coding Episodic Memory (DCEM)
We propose an alternative external key-value memory
architecture inspired by the Dual-Coding theory of human memory (Paivio, 1969). The key idea is
to allow different modalities (language and vision) to determine either the keys (and queries) or the
values. In the present work, because of the structure of the tasks we consider, we align the keys and
queries with language and the values with vision. However, for different problems (such as those
requiring language production) the converse alignment could be made, or a single memory system
could implement both alignments.
In our implementation, at each timestep the agent writes the current linguistic observation embed-
dings lt to the keys of the memory and the current visual embedding vt to its values. To read from
the memory, a query q(vt, lt, ht−1) is computed and compared to the keys by cosine similarity. The
k values whose keys are most similar to the query, [mj]j≤k, are returned together with similarities
[sj]j≤k. To aggregate the returned memories into a single vector rt, the similarities are ﬁrst nor-
malized into a distribution {ˆsj} and then applied to weight the memories ˆmj = ˆsjmj. These k
weighted memories are then passed through a self-attention layer and summed elementwise to pro-
duce rt. As before this is repeated for n read heads, and the results concatenated to form the current
memory read-out rt. rt is then concatenated with ht−1 and new inputs xt to compute a latent vector
et = w(ht−1, rt, xt), which is passed to the core memory LSTM to produce the subsequent state
ht, and ﬁnally et and ht are output to the policy and value networks.

Gated Transformer (XL)
We also consider an architecture where the agent’s core memory is a
Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), including the gating mechanism from Parisotto et al. (2019).
The only difference from Parisotto et al. (2019) is that we consider a multi-modal environment,
where the observations xt passed to the core memory are the concatenation of visual and language
embeddings. We use a 4-layer Transformer with a principal embedding size of 256 (8 parallel heads
with query, key and value size of 32 per layer). These parameters are chosen to give a comparable
number of total learnable parameters to the DCEM architecture.
Policy learning
The agent’s policy is trained by minimizing the standard V-trace off-policy actor-
critic loss (Espeholt et al., 2018). Gradients ﬂow through the policy layer and the core LSTM to the
memory’s query network and the embedding ResNet and self-attention language encoder. We also
use a policy entropy loss as in (Mnih et al., 2016; Espeholt et al., 2018) to encourage random-action
exploration. For more details and hyperparameters see Appendix A.4.
Observation reconstruction
In order to provide a stronger representation-shaping signal, we
make use of a reconstruction loss in addition to the standard V-trace setup. The latent vector et
is passed to a ResNet g that is the transpose of the image encoder, and outputs a reconstruction of
the image input dim
t
= g(et). The image reconstruction loss is the cross entropy between the input
and reconstructed images: lim
t
= −xim
t log dim
t
−(1 −xim
t ) log(1 −dim
t ). The language decoder
is a simple LSTM, which also takes the latent vector et as input and produces a sequence of output
vectors that are projected and softmaxed into classiﬁcations over the vocabulary dlang
t
. The loss
is the cross entropy between the classiﬁcation produced and the one-hot vocabulary indices of the
input words: llang

EXPERIMENTS
We compared the different memory architectures with and without semi-supervised reconstruction
loss on a version of the fast-mapping task involving three objects (N = 3) sampled from a global
set of 30 (|G| = 30). As shown in Table 1, only the DCEM and Transformer architectures reliably
solve the task after 1 × 109 timesteps of training.
DCEM vs. TransformerXL
Importantly, the Transformer and DCEM are the two architectures
that can exploit the principle of dual-coding. Since the inputs to the Transformer are the concate-
nation of visual and language codes, this model can recover the dual-coding aspect of the DCEM
by learning self-attention weights Wk and Wq that project the language code to keys and queries,
and weights Wv to project the visual code to values. Learning in the DCEM was marginally more
sample-efﬁcient, but this is perhaps expected given it was designed with fast-mapping tasks in mind.
In light of this, is it really worth pursing memory systems with explicit episodic memories?

Figure 2:

for agents meta-trained with different numbers of total objects.
To show one clear justiﬁcation for external memory architectures, we conducted an additional com-
parison in which the memory windows of both the DCEM and the Transformer agents were limited
to 100 timesteps (from 1024 in the original experiment), approximately the length of an episode if an
agent is well-trained to the optimal policy. With a memory span of 100, the Transformer is forced to
use the XL window-recurrence mechanism to pass information across context windows (Dai et al.,
2019), while any capacity to retain episodic information beyond 100 timesteps in the DCEM must be
managed by by the LSTM controller. In this setting we observed that the DCEM was substantially
more effective (Table 1, left, bottom). While this imposed memory constraint may seem arbitrary,
in real-world tasks working memory will always be at a premium. These results suggest that DCEM
is more ‘working-memory-efﬁcient’ than the Transformer agent. Indeed, by employing a simple
heuristic by which the agent only writes to its external memory when the language observation
changes from one timestep to the next, the DCEM agent with only 20 memory slots could solve the
task with similar efﬁciency to a Transformer agent with a 1024-slot memory. See Appendix A.1 for
these results and details of the selective writing heuristic.
4.1
GENERALIZATION
To explore the generalization capabilities of our agents, we subjected trained agents to various be-
havioural probes, and measured performance across thousands of episodes without updating their
weights. Unless stated otherwise, all experiments in this section involve the DCEM+Recons agent.
Number of objects
We ﬁrst probed the robustness of the agent to fast-mapping episodes with
different numbers of objects. In all conditions, the same objects appear in both the discovery and
instruction phases of the episode, and the objects are sampled from the same global set G (|G| = 30).
As shown in Figures 2(b) and (c) (red curves), with the (default) meta-training setting involving
three objects in each episode, performance on episodes involving ﬁve objects is approximately 70%,
and with eight objects around 50%. This sub-optimal performance suggests that, with this meta-
training regime, the agent does tend to overﬁt, to some degree, to the “three-ness” of its experience.
Figure 2(b) shows, however, that the overﬁtting of the agent can be alleviated by increasing the
number of objects during meta-training. Finally, Figure 2(a) conﬁrms, perhaps unsurprisingly, that
the agent has no problem generalizing to episodes with fewer objects than it was trained on.
Novel objects
To probe the ability of the agents to quickly learn about any arbitrary new object,
we instrumented trials with objects sampled from a global test set of novel objects H : H ∩G =
∅, |H| = 10. As shown in Figure 3, we found that an agent meta-trained on 20 objects (i.e. |G| = 20)
was almost perfectly robust to novel objects. As may be expected, this robustness degraded to some
degree with decreasing |G|, which is symptomatic of the agent specializing (and overﬁtting) to the
particular features and distinctions of the objects in its environment. However, we only observed a
substantial reduction in robustness to new objects when |G| was reduced as low as three – i.e. a meta-
training experience in which all episodes contain the same three objects (the ﬁrst three elements of
G alphabetically, i.e. a boat, a book and a bottle).

Fast category extension
Children aged between three and four can acquire in one shot not only
bindings between new words and speciﬁc unfamiliar objects, but also bindings between new words
and categories (Behrend et al., 2001; Waxman & Booth, 2000; Vlach & Sandhofer, 2012). We
conducted an analogous experiment by exploiting the category structure in ShapeNet (Chang et al.,
2015). In a test trial, in the discovery phase the agent is presented with exemplars from three novel
(held-out) ShapeNet categories (together with nonsense names). In the instruction phase, the agent
must then pick up a different and unseen exemplar from one of these three new categories as in-
structed. As shown in Figure 4, when trained as described previously, the agent achieves around
55% accuracy on test trials, which is above chance (33%) but still a substantial error rate. However,
this performance can be improved by requiring the agent to extend the training object categories
as it learns. In this regime, three ShapeNet exemplars from distinct classes are encountered by the
agent in the discovery phase of training episodes, and the instruction phase involves different exem-
plars from the same three classes. When trained in this way (which share similarities with matching
networks (Vinyals et al., 2016)), performance on extending novel categories increases to 88%.
Role of temporal aspect
Through ablations we found that both novel objects generalization and
category extension relied on the agent reading multiple values from memory for each query. See A.2
for a discussion of these results, which suggest that the temporal aspect of the agent’s experience
(and learning from multiple views of the same object) is an important driver of generalization.
4.2
INTRINSIC MOTIVATION
The default version of the fast-mapping task includes a shaping reward to encourage the agent to
visit all objects in the room. Without this reward, the credit assignment problem of a fast-mapping
episode is too challenging. However, we found that the DCEM agent was able to solve the task
6

without shaping rewards by employing a memory-based algorithm for intrinsic motivation (NGU;
Badia et al. (2020)). NGU computes a ‘surprise’ score for observations by computing its distance
to other observations in the episodic memory, as described in Appendix A.4.3. The surprise score is
applied as a reward signal rNGU which is added to the environment reward to encourage the agent to
seek new experiences. We compared the effect of doing this in the DNC and the DCEM agents. For
DCEM, the NGU computation can be applied to the memory’s keys (language) column, its values
(vision) column, or both. In the former case, the agent seeks novelty in the language space rNGU
lang ,
and in the latter, in the visual space. The ﬁnal reward is r = rext + λlangrNGU
lang + λimrNGU
im
. As
shown in Figure 5, we found that the DCEM agent (with λlang = 10−3 and λim = 3 × 10−5) was
able to solve the fast-mapping tasks without any shaping reward. This was not the case for the DNC
agent, presumably because the required signal for ‘language-novelty’ is not approximated as well
by the surprise score of the merged visual-language codes in the episodic memory.
4.3
INTEGRATING FAST AND SLOW LEARNING
To test whether our agents can integrate new information with existing lexical (and perceptual and
motor) knowledge, we combined a fast-mapping task with a more conventional instruction-following
task. In the discovery phase, the agent must explore to ﬁnd the names of three unfamiliar objects,
but in this case the room also contains a large box and a large bed, both of which are immovable.
The positions of all objects and the agent are then re-randomized as before. In the instruction phase,
the agent is then instructed to put one of the three movable objects (chosen at random) on either the
bed or in the box (again chosen at random). As shown in Figure 6, if the training regime consisted of
conventional lifting and putting tasks, together with a fast-mapping lifting task and a fast-mapping
putting task, the agent learned to execute the evaluation trials with near-perfect accuracy. Notably,
we also found that substantially-above-chance performance could be achieved on the evaluation
trials without needing to train the agent on the evaluation task in any form. If we trained the agent
on conventional lifting and putting tasks, and a fast-mapping task involving lifting only, the agent
could recombine the knowledge acquired during this training to resolve the evaluation trials as a
novel (zero-shot) task with less-than-perfect but substantially-above-chance accuracy.
4.4
RESULTS WITH ANOTHER ENVIRONMENT
To verify that the observed effects hold beyond our speciﬁc Unity environment, we added a new task
to the DeepMind Lab suite (Beattie et al., 2016). Results for this task are given in Appendix A.3.

RELATED WORK
Meta-learning, of the sort observed in our agent, has been applied to train matching networks: image
classiﬁers that can assign the correct label to a novel image, given a small support set of (image,
label) pairs that includes the correct target label (Vinyals et al., 2016). Our work is also inspired by
7

Figure 6: Right: The accuracy of the agent (accuracy ±S.E.) on evaluation trials when exposed to
different training regimes. Left: Schematic of the most impoverished training regime.
Snell et al. (2017), who propose a more efﬁcient way to integrate a small support set of experience
into a coherent space of image ‘concepts’ for improved fast learning, and Santoro et al. (2016), who
show that the successful meta-training of image classiﬁers can beneﬁt substantially from external
memory architectures such as Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2014) or DNC (Graves et al., 2016).
In NLP, meta-learning has been used to train few-shot classiﬁers for various tasks (see Yin (2020)
for a recent survey). Meta-learning has also previously been observed in reinforcement learning
agents trained with conventional policy-gradient algorithms (Duan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019).
In Model-Agnostic Meta Learning (Finn et al., 2017), models are (meta) trained to be easily tunable
(by any gradient algorithm) given a small number of novel data points. When combined with policy-
gradient algorithms, this technique yields fast learning on both 2D navigation and 3D locomotion
tasks. In cognitive tasks where fast learning is not explicitly required, external memories have
proven to help goal-directed agents (Fortunato et al., 2019), and can be particularly powerful when
combined with an observation reconstruction loss (Wayne et al., 2018).
Recent work at the intersection of psychology and machine learning is also relevant in that it shows
how the noisy, ﬁrst-person perspective of a child can support the acquisition of robust visual cat-
egories in artiﬁcial neural networks (Bambach et al., 2018). When deep networks are trained on
data recorded from children’s head cameras, unsupervised or semi-supervised learning objectives
can substantially improve the quality of the resulting representations (Orhan et al., 2020).

CONCLUSION
Our experiments have highlighted various beneﬁts of having an explicitly multi-modal episodic
memory system. First, mechanisms that allow the agent to query its memory in a modality-speciﬁc
way (either within or across modalities) can better allow them to rapidly infer and exploit connec-
tions between perceptual experience and words, and therefore to realize fast-mapping, a notable
aspect of human learning. Second, external (read-write) memories can achieve better performance
for the same number of memory ‘slots’ than Transformer-based memories. This greater ‘memory-
efﬁciency’ may be increasingly important as agents are applied to real-world tasks with very long
episodic horizons. Third, in cases where it is useful to estimate the degree of novelty or “surprise”
in the current state of the environment (for instance to derive a signal for intrinsic motivation), a
more informative signal may be obtained by separately estimating novelty based on each modality
and aggregating the result. Finally, an episodic memory system may ultimately be essential for fast
knowledge consolidation. The potential for memory buffers and ofﬂine learning processes such as
experience replay to support knowledge consolidation is not a new idea (McClelland et al., 1995;
Mnih et al., 2016; Lillicrap et al., 2016; McClelland et al., 2020). For language learning agents,
the need to both rapidly acquire and retain multi-modal knowledge may further motivate explicit
8

external memories. Retaining in memory visual experiences together with aligned (and hopefully
pertinent) language (i.e. a dual-coding schema) may facilitate something akin to ofﬂine ‘supervised’
language learning. We leave this possibility for future investigations, which we will facilitate by
releasing publicly the environments and tasks described in this paper.

APPENDICES
A.1
COMPARING TRANSFORMERXL TO DCEM WHEN MEMORY IS LIMITED
Both the TransformerXL and DCEM/DNC agents have a hyperparameter that determines the effec-
tive size of their explicit working memory. In a vanilla Transformer it determines the size of the
window of timesteps that the network can be applied to for each forward (and backward) pass. To
give models some chance of passing information beyond this hard constraint, TransformerXL ar-
chitecture conditions each forward pass also on representations computed in the previous window,
which establishes a form of recurrence over time from window to window. In our original exper-
iments, this mechanism was not tested, because we set the window size to 1024 timesteps, which
is longer than most episodes of the fast-mapping task, which are typically 80-120 timesteps for a
well-trained agent.
To examine the performance of the TransformerXL in cases where it is required to pass information
across context windows, we reduced the size of the window. For a fair comparison, we similarly
reduced the equivalent parameter (the capacity in rows in the FIFO external memory) for the DCEM
agent. As shown in Figure 7, for cases where the memory window size (or buffer) is reduced to (100)
or below (50, 20) the normal episode length, the DCEM performs better than the TransformerXL
agent. This suggests that the TransformerXL has difﬁculty making the necessary (visual and lin-
guistic) information available to policy head when that information must be passed between context
windows. Surprisingly, the DCEM was able to learn the tasks efﬁciently with a memory size of
50, which suggests that it must exploit its LSTM controller to retain sufﬁcient information when its
external memory begins to overﬂow. Both architectures fail when the memory size is reduced to 20,
but in that case a DCEM agent can in fact learn the optimal policy if a simple heuristic for selective
writing, described below, is employed. This highlights an advantage of explicitly read-write external
memories; information can be managed via the reading or the writing process. It is not immediately
obvious how the same strategy could be applied with a window-based memory architectecture like
TransformerXL.

formerXL for different sizes of memory-buffer (DCEM) or window (TransformerXL).
A.1.1
SELECTIVE WRITING HEURISTIC
One advantage of explicit external (read-write) memories is that the ﬂow of information to the
agent’s policy can be inﬂuenced by the writing process as well as the reading function. To ver-
ify this fact, we implemented a simple non-parametric heuristic writing condition in the DCEM
architecture, whereby observations are written to the external memory when there is a change to the
observation in the language channel. This heuristic aligns with the principle of dual-coding exploited
elsewhere in the paper: while visual observations change continuously every timestep, changes to
observed language are rare events that might signal some important change in the environment.
More formally, our heuristic relies on a window size parameter w that we set to 3 in all cases. For
observation xt = {vt, lt}, a language change indicator It ∈N is set as I0 = 0

Then, the content ct written to memory at t is
ct =
{vt, lt},
if t −It < w
∅,
otherwise,
where, as before, vt, lt are the agent embeddings of the visual and linguistic observations. Thus,
memories are written for w timesteps proceeding a change in the language observation.
A.2
ROLE OF TEMPORAL ASPECT IN GENERALIZATION
In seeking to understand the mechanisms that support the generalization effects reported in the
main paper, we found that the parameter k was an important factor, where the top-k memories are
returned to the agent policy head per memory read. As the agent explores during the discovery phase
of episodes, it writes multiple perspectives of the same object to memory. As shown in Figure 8,
both its robustness to entirely novel objects (left) and its ability to extend categories from novel
exemplars (right), as well as its ability to solve the training task, are enhanced when k > 1; i.e.
when it determines which object to visit in the instruction phase based on memories written from
more than one view of each object.
A.3
VERIFICATION IN DEEPMIND LAB
At a high level, the design of an episode is very similar to the default fast-mapping task in the Unity
environment. The agent must move down a corridor, bumping into (and collecting) three distinct
objects. When an agent collects an object it is immediately presented with the (episode-speciﬁc)
name for that object. After passing three objects, the corridor opens into a room containing two
of the three objects found in the corridor. Upon entering the room, the agent is presented with the
name corresponding to one of the two objects, and must bump into that object in order to receive
a reward of 1. As before, a shaping reward of 0.1 is given as the agent collects each object in the
corridor. Compared with the Unity environment, the DeepMind Lab action space is smaller (8 vs.
46 actions), the objects are larger, and the agent has no substantive way to interact with the objects
(they disappear the moment the agent collides with them). Note also that the agent must choose
between 2 (rather than 3) objects in the instruction phase, so an agent selecting objects at random
would achieve 50% accuracy.
To provide some sense of the robustness and generality of the effects observed thus far, we applied
the various agent architectures directly to this environment with no environment-speciﬁc tuning. As
shown in Table 2, without any further tuning of the agent, we observe a similar pattern of results

performed best, with three and two seeds out of ﬁve (respectively) mastering the training task. As

INTRINSIC MOTIVATION ALGORITHM
The intrinsic reward is based on the similarity (Euclidean distance) between the new embedding e
and the nearest neighbors already present in memory {ei}. The average distance ¯ρ used below is a
lifetime average of all ρi that is updated with every computation.

SHAPENET
ShapeNet contains 3D models of objects with a wide range of complexity and quality. To guarantee
that the models are recognizable and of a high quality, we manually ﬁltered the ShapeNet Sem
dataset, selecting a subset of everyday semantic classes, ensuring that the selected models had a
reasonable number of vertices, and reasonable size and weight dimensions. The selected classes
(number of models in each class) were as follows, with a total of 1,437 models across 31 different
classes:
armoire (31), bag (11), bed (65), book (47), bookcase (13), bottle (26), box (37), bunk bed (9), chair
(150), chest of drawers (133), coffee table (43), computer (6), ﬂoor lamp (68), glass (11), hammer
