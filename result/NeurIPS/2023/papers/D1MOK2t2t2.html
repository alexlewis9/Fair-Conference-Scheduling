Given the completion of two years of BASALT competitions, we offer to the community a formalized benchmark through the BASALT Evaluation and Demonstrations Dataset (BEDD), which serves as a resource for algorithm development and performance assessment. BEDD consists of a collection of 26 million image-action pairs from nearly 14,000 videos of human players completing the BASALT tasks in Minecraft. It also includes over 3,000 dense pairwise human evaluations of human and algorithmic agents. These comparisons serve as a fixed, preliminary leaderboard for evaluating newly-developed algorithms.  To enable this comparison, we present a streamlined codebase for benchmarking new algorithms against the leaderboard. In addition to presenting these datasets, we conduct a detailed analysis of the data from both datasets to guide algorithm development and evaluation. The released code and data are available at https://github.com/minerllabs/basalt-benchmark.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4B Datasets & Benchmarks</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=D1MOK2t2t2</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=D1MOK2t2t2</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4B Datasets & Benchmarks</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B RL</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6D Theory</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6D Theory</div></body></html>
