Specifically, nonlinear or discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous, predictable changes in model performance.We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3 family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities, (2) make, test and confirm two predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on BIG-Bench; and (3) show how to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen seemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep networks.Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent abilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ITw9edRDlD</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=ITw9edRDlD</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div></body></html>
