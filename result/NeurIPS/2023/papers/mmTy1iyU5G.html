In those methods a deep neural network is used as a solution generator which is then trained by gradient-based methods (e.g., policy gradient) to successively obtain better solution distributions.In this work we introduce a novel theoretical framework for analyzing the effectiveness of such methods. We ask whether there exist generative models that (i) are expressive enough to generate approximately optimal solutions; (ii) have a tractable, i.e, polynomial in the size of the input, number of parameters; (iii) their optimization landscape is benign in the sense that it does not contain sub-optimal stationary points. Our main contribution is a positive answer to this question. Our result holds for a broad class of combinatorial problems including Max- and Min-Cut, Max-$k$-CSP, Maximum-Weight-Bipartite-Matching, and the Traveling Salesman Problem. As a byproduct of our analysis we introduce a novel regularization process over vanilla gradient descent and provide theoretical and experimental evidence that it helps address vanishing-gradient issues and escape bad stationary points.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5C Probability/Sampling</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=mmTy1iyU5G</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=mmTy1iyU5G</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5C Probability/Sampling</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4C COT/reasoning</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5C Probability/Sampling</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5C Probability/Sampling</div></body></html>
