This reflects an impaired mapping between linguistic binding of entities and modifiers in the prompt and visual binding of the corresponding elements in the generated image. As one example, a query like ``a pink sunflower and a yellow flamingo'' may incorrectly produce an image of a yellow sunflower and a pink flamingo. To remedy this issue, we propose SynGen, an approach which first syntactically analyses the prompt to identify entities and their modifiers, and then uses a novel loss function that encourages the cross-attention maps to agree with the linguistic binding reflected by the syntax. Specifically, we encourage large overlap between attention maps of entities and their modifiers, and small overlap with other entities and modifier words. The loss is optimized during inference, without retraining or fine-tuning the model. Human evaluation on three datasets, including one new and challenging set, demonstrate significant improvements of SynGen compared with current state of the art methods. This work highlights how making use of sentence structure during inference can efficiently and substantially improve the faithfulness of text-to-image generation.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2B Objects/ Neuroscience/Vision</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=AOKU4nRw1W</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=AOKU4nRw1W</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2B Objects/ Neuroscience/Vision</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div></body></html>
