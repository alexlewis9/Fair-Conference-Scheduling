Past research uncovered that private learners may need to exhibit significantly higher sample complexity than non-private learners as is the case of learning of one-dimensional threshold functions [Bun et al., FOCS 2015, Alon et al., STOC 2019].We explore prediction as an alternative to learning. A predictor answers a stream of classification queries instead of outputting a hypothesis. Earlier work has considered a private prediction model with a single classification query [Dwork and Feldman, COLT 2018]. We observe that when answering a stream of queries, a predictor must modify the hypothesis it uses over time, and in a manner that  cannot rely solely on the training set.We introduce {\em private everlasting prediction} taking into account the privacy of both the training set {\em and} the (adaptively chosen) queries made to the predictor. We then present a generic construction of private everlasting predictors in the PAC model.The sample complexity of the initial training sample in our construction is quadratic (up to polylog factors) in the VC dimension of the concept class. Our construction allows prediction for all concept classes with finite VC dimension, and in particular threshold functions over infinite domains, for which (traditional) private learning is known to be impossible.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2D Privacy</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=y8UAQQHVTX</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=y8UAQQHVTX</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2D Privacy</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2D Privacy</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2D Privacy</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2D Privacy</div></body></html>
