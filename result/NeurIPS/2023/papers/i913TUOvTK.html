Even though recent research has seen great success in reconstructing static images from non-invasive brain recordings, work on recovering continuous visual experiences in the form of videos is limited. In this work, we propose Mind-Video that learns spatiotemporal information from continuous fMRI data of the cerebral cortex progressively through masked brain modeling, multimodal contrastive learning with spatiotemporal attention, and co-training with an augmented Stable Diffusion model that incorporates network temporal inflation. We show that high-quality videos of arbitrary frame rates can be reconstructed with Mind-Video using adversarial guidance. The recovered videos were evaluated with various semantic and pixel-level metrics. We achieved an average accuracy of 85% in semantic classification tasks and 0.19 in structural similarity index (SSIM), outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 45%. We also show that our model is biologically plausible and interpretable, reflecting established physiological processes.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=i913TUOvTK</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=i913TUOvTK</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div></body></html>
