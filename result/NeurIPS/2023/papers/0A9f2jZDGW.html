Yet, our understanding of the effectiveness of task arithmetic and its underlying principles remains limited. We present a comprehensive study of task arithmetic in vision-language models and show that weight disentanglement is the crucial factor that makes it effective. This property arises during pre-training and manifests when distinct directions in weight space govern separate, localized regions in function space associated with the tasks. Notably, we show that fine-tuning models in their tangent space by linearizing them amplifies weight disentanglement. This leads to substantial performance improvements across multiple task arithmetic benchmarks and diverse models. Building on these findings, we provide theoretical and empirical analyses of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of these models and establish a compelling link between task arithmetic and the spatial localization of the NTK eigenfunctions. Overall, our work uncovers novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of task arithmetic and offers a more reliable and effective approach to edit pre-trained models through the NTK linearization.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=0A9f2jZDGW</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=0A9f2jZDGW</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4C COT/reasoning</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4A Optimization</div></body></html>
