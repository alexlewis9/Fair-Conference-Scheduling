Several recent studies, on tasks ranging from group operations to in-context linear regression, have suggested that the answer is yes. Using modular addition as a prototypical problem, we show that algorithm discovery in neural networks is sometimes more complex: small changes to model hyperparameters and initializations can induce discovery of qualitatively different algorithms from a fixed training set, and even learning of multiple different solutions in parallel. In modular addition, we specifically show that models learn a known Clock algorithm, a previously undescribed, less intuitive, but comprehensible procedure we term the Pizza algorithm, and a variety of even more complex procedures. Our results show that even simple learning problems can admit a surprising diversity of solutions, motivating the development of new tools for mechanistically characterizing the behavior of neural networks across the algorithmic phase space.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S5wmbQc1We</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=S5wmbQc1We</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2A Efficient Learning</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4C COT/reasoning</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4C COT/reasoning</div></body></html>
