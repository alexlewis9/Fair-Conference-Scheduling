However, this field is hindered by the lack of a unified benchmark. To fill this gap, we introduce MetaBox, the first benchmark platform expressly tailored for developing and evaluating MetaBBO-RL methods. MetaBox offers a flexible algorithmic template that allows users to effortlessly implement their unique designs within the platform. Moreover, it provides a broad spectrum of over 300 problem instances, collected from synthetic to realistic scenarios, and an extensive library of 19 baseline methods, including both traditional black-box optimizers and recent MetaBBO-RL methods. Besides, MetaBox introduces three standardized performance metrics, enabling a more thorough assessment of the methods. In a bid to illustrate the utility of MetaBox for facilitating rigorous evaluation and in-depth analysis, we carry out a wide-ranging benchmarking study on existing MetaBBO-RL methods. Our MetaBox is open-source and accessible at: https://github.com/GMC-DRL/MetaBox.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B RL</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=j2wasUypqN</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=j2wasUypqN</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B RL</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3C Diffusion Models</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B RL</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B RL</div></body></html>
