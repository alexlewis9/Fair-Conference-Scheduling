Conventional evaluation metrics, and even explanation methods -- which mainly follow the paradigm of feeding the explanatory subgraph and measuring output difference -- always suffer from the notorious out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. In this work, we endeavor to confront the issue by introducing a novel evaluation metric, termed O OD-resistant A dversarial R obustness (OAR). Specifically, we draw inspiration from the notion of adversarial robustness and evaluate post-hoc explanation subgraphs by calculating their robustness under attack. On top of that, an elaborate OOD reweighting block is inserted into the pipeline to confine the evaluation process to the original data distribution. For applications involving large datasets, we further devise a Sim plified version of OAR (SimOAR), which achieves a significant improvement in computational efficiency at the cost of a small amount of performance. Extensive empirical studies validate the effectiveness of our OAR and SimOAR.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5A GNNs/Invariance</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=eD534mPhAg</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=eD534mPhAg</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5A GNNs/Invariance</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5D Vision</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1B Datasets & Benchmarks</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5A GNNs/Invariance</div></body></html>
