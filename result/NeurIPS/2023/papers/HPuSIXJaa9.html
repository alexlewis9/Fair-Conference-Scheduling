Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper, we leverage a mapping between reward functions and optimal policies to show that this constrained reward maximization problem can be optimized exactly with a single stage of policy training, essentially solving a classification problem on the human preference data. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for fitting a reward model, sampling from the LM during fine-tuning, or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds RLHF's ability to control sentiment of generations and improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B RL</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HPuSIXJaa9</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=HPuSIXJaa9</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B RL</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1A RL</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2A Efficient Learning</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1B Datasets & Benchmarks</div></body></html>
