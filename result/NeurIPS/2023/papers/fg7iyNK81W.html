Most machine learning efforts addressing this issue in an unsupervised setting have focused on slot-based methods, which may be limiting due to their discrete nature and difficulty to express uncertainty. Recently, the Complex AutoEncoder was proposed as an alternative that learns continuous and distributed object-centric representations. However, it is only applicable to simple toy data. In this paper, we present Rotating Features, a generalization of complex-valued features to higher dimensions, and a new evaluation procedure for extracting objects from distributed representations. Additionally, we show the applicability of our approach to pre-trained features. Together, these advancements enable us to scale distributed object-centric representations from simple toy to real-world data. We believe this work advances a new paradigm for addressing the binding problem in machine learning and has the potential to inspire further innovation in the field.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2B Objects/ Neuroscience/Vision</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=fg7iyNK81W</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=fg7iyNK81W</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2B Objects/ Neuroscience/Vision</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div></body></html>
