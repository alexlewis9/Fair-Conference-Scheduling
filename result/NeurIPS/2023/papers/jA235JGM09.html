Going beyond recognition of the issue, we investigate why such attacks succeed and how they can be created. We hypothesize two failure modes of safety training: competing objectives and mismatched generalization. Competing objectives arise when a model’s capabilities and safety goals conflict, while mismatched generalization occurs when safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which capabilities exist. We use these failure modes to guide jailbreak design and then evaluate state-of-the-art models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude v1.3, against both existing and newly designed attacks. We find that vulnerabilities persist despite the extensive red-teaming and safety-training efforts behind these models. Notably, new attacks utilizing our failure modes succeed on every prompt in a collection of unsafe requests from the models’ red-teaming evaluation sets and outperform existing ad hoc jailbreaks. Our analysis emphasizes the need for safety-capability parity—that safety mechanisms should be as sophisticated as the underlying model—and argues against the idea that scaling alone can resolve these safety failure modes.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=jA235JGM09</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=jA235JGM09</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A LLMs</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1B Datasets & Benchmarks</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5A GNNs/Invariance</div></body></html>
