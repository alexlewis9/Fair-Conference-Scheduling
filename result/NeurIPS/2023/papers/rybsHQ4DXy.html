However, current video understanding approaches reason over visual features from short video clips that are detached from the underlying physical space and  capture only what is immediately visible. To facilitate human-centric environment understanding, we present an approach that links egocentric video and the environment by learning representations that are predictive of the camera-wearer's (potentially unseen) local surroundings. We train such models using videos from agents in simulated 3D environments where the environment is fully observable, and test them on human-captured real-world videos from unseen environments. On two human-centric video tasks, we show that models equipped with our environment-aware features consistently outperform their counterparts with traditional clip features. Moreover, despite being trained exclusively on simulated videos, our approach successfully handles real-world videos from HouseTours and Ego4D, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Ego4D NLQ challenge.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5D Vision</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rybsHQ4DXy</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=rybsHQ4DXy</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5D Vision</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3A Neuro</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5D Vision</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5D Vision</div></body></html>
