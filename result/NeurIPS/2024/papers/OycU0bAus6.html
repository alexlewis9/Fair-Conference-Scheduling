Representation learning is important in discriminative tasks, which is defined as "learning representations (or features) of the data that make it easier to extract useful information when building classifiers or other predictors" . In this paper, we propose a novel Denoising Model for Representation Learning ( DenoiseRep ) to improve feature discrimination with joint feature extraction and denoising. DenoiseRep views each embedding layer in a backbone as a denoising layer, processing the cascaded embedding layers as if we are recursively denoise features step-by-step. This unifies the frameworks of feature extraction and denoising, where the former progressively embeds features from low-level to high-level, and the latter recursively denoises features step-by-step. After that, DenoiseRep fuses the parameters of feature extraction and denoising layers, and theoretically demonstrates its equivalence before and after the fusion, thus making feature denoising computation-free. DenoiseRep is a label-free algorithm that incrementally improves features but also complementary to the label if available. Experimental results on various discriminative vision tasks, including re-identification (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, MSMT17, CUHK-03, vehicleID), image classification (ImageNet, UB200, Oxford-Pet, Flowers), object detection (COCO), image segmentation (ADE20K) show stability and impressive improvements. We also validate its effectiveness on the CNN (ResNet) and Transformer (ViT, Swin, Vmamda) architectures.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4C: Diffusion-based Models, Mathematics</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=OycU0bAus6</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=OycU0bAus6</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4C: Diffusion-based Models, Mathematics</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 2D: Generative Models</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4C: Diffusion-based Models, Mathematics</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4C: Diffusion-based Models, Mathematics</div></body></html>
