In previous works, the polynomial scaling in $d$ was addressed by amortizing the computation over the optimization process via randomization. Separately, the exponential scaling in $k$ for univariate functions ($d=1$) was addressed with high-order auto-differentiation (AD). In this work, we show how to efficiently perform arbitrary contraction of the derivative tensor of arbitrary order for multivariate functions, by properly constructing the input tangents to univariate high-order AD, which can be used to efficiently randomize any differential operator.  When applied to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), our method provides >1000$\times$ speed-up and >30$\times$ memory reduction over randomization with first-order AD, and we can now solve 1-million-dimensional PDEs in 8 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. This work opens the possibility of using high-order differential operators in large-scale problems.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5D: Machine Learning and Science</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=J2wI2rCG2u</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=J2wI2rCG2u</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5D: Machine Learning and Science</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 1C: Optimization and Learning Theory</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5D: Machine Learning and Science</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 6A: Machine Learning and Science, Safety</div></body></html>
