Unlike approaches that extend or search for rationales, DeAR is featured by 1) adopting a tree-based question decomposition manner to plan the organization of rationales, which mimics the logical planning inherentin human cognition; 2) globally updating the rationales at each reasoning step through natural language feedback. Specifically, the Decompose stage decomposes the question into simpler sub-questions, storing them as new nodes; the Analyze stage generates and self-checks rationales for sub-questions at each node evel; and the Rethink stage updates parent-node rationales based on feedback from their child nodes. By generating and updating the reasoning process from a more global perspective, DeAR constructs more adaptive and accurate logical structures for complex problems, facilitating timely error correction compared to rationale-extension and search-based approaches such as Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) and Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). We conduct extensive experiments on three reasoning benchmarks, including ScienceQA, StrategyQA, and GSM8K, which cover a variety of reasoning tasks, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces logical errors and enhances performance across various LLMs. Furthermore, we validate that DeAR is an efficient method that achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and reasoning time compared to ToT and GoT.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 3B: Natural Language Processing</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=NPKZF1WDjZ</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=NPKZF1WDjZ</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 3B: Natural Language Processing</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 3C: Natural Language Processing</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 3C: Natural Language Processing</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 3B: Natural Language Processing</div></body></html>
