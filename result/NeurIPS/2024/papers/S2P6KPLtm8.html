To address this problem, most existing methods attempt to find proper valid instrumental variables (IVs) for the target causal effect by expert knowledge or by assuming that the causal model is a one-directional MR model. As such, in this paper, we first theoretically investigate the identification of the bi-directional MR from observational data. In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which valid IV sets are correctly identified such that the bi-directional MR model is identifiable, including the causal directions of a pair of phenotypes (i.e., the treatment and outcome).Moreover, based on the identification theory, we develop a cluster fusion-like method to discover valid IV sets and estimate the causal effects of interest.We theoretically demonstrate the correctness of the proposed algorithm.Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method for estimating causal effects in both one-directional and bi-directional MR models.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5B: Graph Neural Networks, Causal Inference</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S2P6KPLtm8</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=S2P6KPLtm8</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5B: Graph Neural Networks, Causal Inference</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5C: Machine Vision</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5B: Graph Neural Networks, Causal Inference</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5B: Graph Neural Networks, Causal Inference</div></body></html>
