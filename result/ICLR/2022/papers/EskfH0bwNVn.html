Influence function is a  technique that estimates the impacts of a training sample on the modelâ€™s predictions. Recent studies on \emph{data resampling} have employed influence functions to identify \emph{harmful} training samples that will degrade model's test performance. They have shown that discarding or downweighting the identified harmful training samples is an effective way to resolve training biases. In this work, we move one step forward and propose an influence-based relabeling framework named RDIA for reusing harmful training samples toward better model performance. To achieve this, we use influence functions to estimate how relabeling a training sample would affect model's test performance and further develop a novel relabeling function R. We theoretically prove that applying R to relabel harmful training samples allows the model to achieve lower test loss than simply discarding them for any classification tasks using cross-entropy loss. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets demonstrate RDIA outperforms the state-of-the-art data resampling methods and improves model's robustness against label noise.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Probablistic Models, Vision</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=EskfH0bwNVn</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=EskfH0bwNVn</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Probablistic Models, Vision</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: AI Applications</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3: Learning from distribution shift</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3: Learning from distribution shift</div></body></html>
