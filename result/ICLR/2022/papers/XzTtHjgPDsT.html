For example, Transformers segment by position, and object-centric architectures decompose images into entities. In all these architectures, interactions between different elements are modeled via pairwise interactions: Transformers make use of self-attention to incorporate information from other positions and object-centric architectures make use of graph neural networks to model interactions among entities.  We consider how to improve on pairwise interactions in terms of global coordination and a coherent, integrated representation that can be used for downstream tasks. In cognitive science, a global workspace architecture has been proposed in which functionally  specialized  components share information through a common, bandwidth-limited communication channel. We explore the use of such a communication channel in the context of deep learning for modeling the structure of complex environments. The proposed method includes a shared workspace through which communication among different specialist modules takes place but due to limits on the communication bandwidth, specialist modules must compete for access. We show that capacity limitations have  a rational basis in that (1) they encourage specialization and compositionality and (2) they facilitate the synchronization of otherwise  independent specialists.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3: Meta-learning and adaptation</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=XzTtHjgPDsT</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=XzTtHjgPDsT</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3: Meta-learning and adaptation</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: Structured learning</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: AI applications</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: AI applications</div></body></html>
