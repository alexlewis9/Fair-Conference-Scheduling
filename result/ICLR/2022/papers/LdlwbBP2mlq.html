Most existing analyses of these methods assume independent and unbiased gradient estimates obtained via with-replacement sampling. In contrast, we study shuffling-based variants: minibatch and local Random Reshuffling, which draw stochastic gradients without replacement and are thus closer to practice. For smooth functions satisfying the Polyak-≈Åojasiewicz condition, we obtain convergence bounds (in the large epoch regime) which show that these shuffling-based variants converge faster than their with-replacement counterparts. Moreover, we prove matching lower bounds showing that our convergence analysis is tight. Finally, we propose an algorithmic modification called synchronized shuffling that leads to convergence rates faster than our lower bounds in near-homogeneous settings.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: Understanding Deep Learning</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LdlwbBP2mlq</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=LdlwbBP2mlq</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: Understanding Deep Learning</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: Learning in the wild,  Reinforcement learning</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Probablistic Models, Vision</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: Understanding Deep Learning</div></body></html>
