Standard adversarial attacks are not effective in real-time streaming situations because the characteristics of the signal will have changed by the time the attack is executed. We introduce predictive adversarial attacks, which achieves real-time performance by forecasting the attack vector that will be the most effective in the future. Under real-time constraints, our method jams the established speech recognition system DeepSpeech 3.9x more than online projected gradient descent as measured through word error rate, and 6.6x more as measured through character error rate. We furthermore demonstrate our approach is practically effective in realistic environments with complex scene geometries.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: AI Applications</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=qj1IZ-6TInc</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=qj1IZ-6TInc</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: AI Applications</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Probablistic Models, Vision</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: AI Applications</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: AI applications</div></body></html>
