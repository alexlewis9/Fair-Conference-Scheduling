Specifically, we tackle the problem of constructing a full static human pose based on sparse and variable user inputs (e.g. locations and/or orientations of a subset of body joints). To solve this problem, we propose a novel neural architecture that combines residual connections with prototype encoding of a partially specified pose to create a new complete pose from the learned latent space. We show that our architecture outperforms a baseline based on Transformer, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, we develop a user interface to integrate our neural model in Unity, a real-time 3D development platform. Furthermore, we introduce two new datasets representing the static human pose modeling problem, based on high-quality human motion capture data, which will be released publicly along with model code.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: AI Applications</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=s03AQxehtd_</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=s03AQxehtd_</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: AI Applications</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: AI Applications</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: AI applications</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: AI applications</div></body></html>
