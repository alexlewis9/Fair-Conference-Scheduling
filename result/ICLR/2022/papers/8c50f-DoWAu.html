The most challenging one often referred to as one-shot many-to-many voice conversion consists in copying target voice from only one reference utterance in the most general case when both source and target speakers do not belong to the training dataset. We present a scalable high-quality solution based on diffusion probabilistic modeling and demonstrate its superior quality compared to state-of-the-art one-shot voice conversion approaches. Moreover, focusing on real-time applications, we investigate general principles which can make diffusion models faster while keeping synthesis quality at a high level. As a result, we develop a novel Stochastic Differential Equations solver suitable for various diffusion model types and generative tasks as shown through empirical studies and justify it by theoretical analysis.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Sequence modeling</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=8c50f-DoWAu</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=8c50f-DoWAu</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Sequence modeling</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Sequence modeling</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Probablistic Models, Vision</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Probablistic Models, Vision</div></body></html>
