However, most classifiers fail to predict label $Y$ from input $X$ when the change in environment is due a (stochastic) input transformation $T^\text{te} \circ X'$ not observed in training, as in training we observe $T^\text{tr} \circ X'$, where $X'$ is a hidden variable. This work argues that when the transformations in train $T^\text{tr}$ and test $T^\text{te}$ are (arbitrary) symmetry transformations induced by a collection of known $m$ equivalence relations, the task of finding a robust OOD classifier can be defined as finding the simplest causal model that defines a causal connection between the target labels and the symmetry transformations that are associated with label changes. We then propose a new learning paradigm, asymmetry learning, that identifies which symmetries the classifier must break in order to correctly predict $Y$ in both train and test. Asymmetry learning performs a causal model search that, under certain identifiability conditions, finds classifiers that perform equally well in-distribution and out-of-distribution. Finally, we show how to learn counterfactually-invariant representations with asymmetry learning in two physics tasks.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3: Learning from distribution shift</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=avgclFZ221l</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=avgclFZ221l</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3: Learning from distribution shift</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3: Learning from distribution shift</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3: Learning from distribution shift</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3: Learning from distribution shift</div></body></html>
