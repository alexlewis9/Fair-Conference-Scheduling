Results regarding separation power are, however, usually geared at specific GNNs architectures, and tools for understanding arbitrary GNN architectures are generally lacking. We provide an elegant way to easily obtain bounds on the separation power of GNNs in terms of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) tests, which have become the yardstick to measure the separation power of GNNs. The crux is to view GNNs as expressions in a procedural tensor language describing the computations in the layers of the GNNs. Then, by a simple analysis of the obtained expressions, in terms of the number of indexes used and the nesting depth of summations, bounds on the separation power in terms of the WL-tests readily follow. We use tensor language to define Higher-Order Message-Passing Neural Networks (or k-MPNNs), a natural extension of MPNNs. Furthermore, the tensor language point of view allows for the derivation of universality results for classes of GNNs in a natural way. Our approach provides a toolbox with which GNN architecture designers can analyze the separation power of their GNNs, without needing to know the intricacies of the WL-tests. We also provide insights in what is needed to boost the separation power of GNNs.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: Understanding Deep Learning</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=wIzUeM3TAU</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=wIzUeM3TAU</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: Understanding Deep Learning</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: Learning in the wild,  Reinforcement learning</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: Structured learning</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2: Structured learning</div></body></html>
