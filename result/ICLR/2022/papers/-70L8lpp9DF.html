However, few studies have reasoned about the privacy leakage resulting from the multiple training runs needed to fine tune the value of the training algorithmâ€™s hyperparameters. In this work, we first illustrate how simply setting hyperparameters based on non-private training runs can leak private information. Motivated by this observation, we then provide privacy guarantees for hyperparameter search procedures within the framework of Renyi Differential Privacy. Our results improve and extend the work of Liu and Talwar (STOC 2019). Our analysis supports our previous observation that tuning hyperparameters does indeed leak private information, but we prove that, under certain assumptions, this leakage is modest, as long as each candidate training run needed to select hyperparameters is itself differentially private.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: Learning in the wild,  Reinforcement learning</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=-70L8lpp9DF</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=-70L8lpp9DF</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1: Learning in the wild,  Reinforcement learning</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Sequence modeling</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Probablistic Models, Vision</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4: Probablistic Models, Vision</div></body></html>
