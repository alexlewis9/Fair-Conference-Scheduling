However, many studies show an attacker could carefully perturb the structure and/or node features in a graph such that a graph classifier misclassifies the perturbed graph. Such vulnerability impedes the deployment of graph classification in security/safety-critical applications. Existing empirical defenses lack formal robustness guarantees and could be broken by adaptive or unknown attacks. Existing provable defenses have the following limitations: 1)  they achieve sub-optimal robustness guarantees for graph structure perturbation, 2) they cannot provide robustness guarantees for arbitrarily node feature perturbations, 3) their robustness guarantees are probabilistic, meaning they could be incorrect with a non-zero probability, and 4) they incur large computation costs. We aim to address those limitations in this work. We propose GNNCert, a certified defense against both graph structure and node feature perturbations for graph classification. Our GNNCert provably predicts the same label for a graph when the number of perturbed edges and the number of nodes with perturbed features are bounded. Our results on 8 benchmark datasets show that GNNCert outperforms three state-of-the-art methods.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=IGzaH538fz</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=IGzaH538fz</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1D</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B</div></body></html>
