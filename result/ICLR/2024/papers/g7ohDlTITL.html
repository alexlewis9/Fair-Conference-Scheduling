Existing methods for generative modeling on manifolds either require expensive simulation, are inherently unable to scale to high dimensions, or use approximations for limiting quantities that result in biased training objectives. Riemannian Flow Matching bypasses these limitations and offers several advantages over previous approaches: it is simulation-free on simple geometries, does not require divergence computation, and computes its target vector field in closed-form. The key ingredient behind RFM is the construction of a relatively simple premetric for defining target vector fields, which encompasses the existing Euclidean case. To extend to general geometries, we rely on the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute premetrics on the fly. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world non-Euclidean datasets, and we demonstrate tractable training on general geometries, including triangular meshes with highly non-trivial curvature and boundaries.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4B</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=g7ohDlTITL</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=g7ohDlTITL</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4B</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3B</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3B</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4D</div></body></html>
