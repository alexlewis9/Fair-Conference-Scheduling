Deep learning approaches, such as transformers, have recently challenged the simulation paradigm with complex network forecasts. However, they often act as data-driven black-box models that neglect the underlying physics and lack uncertainty quantification. We address these limitations with ClimODE, a  spatiotemporal continuous-time process that implements a key principle of advection from statistical mechanics, namely, weather changes due to a spatial movement of quantities over time. ClimODE models precise weather evolution with value-conserving dynamics, learning global weather transport as a neural flow, which also enables estimating the uncertainty in predictions. Our approach outperforms existing data-driven methods in global and regional forecasting with an order of magnitude smaller parameterization, establishing a new state of the art.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1A</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=xuY33XhEGR</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=xuY33XhEGR</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1A</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3C</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1A</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1A</div></body></html>
