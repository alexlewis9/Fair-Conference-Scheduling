Existing approaches typically handle dropout error via imputation, which may introduce spurious relations as the true joint distribution is generally unidentifiable. To tackle this issue, we introduce a causal graphical model to characterize the dropout mechanism, namely, Causal Dropout Model. We provide a simple yet effective theoretical result: interestingly, the conditional independence (CI) relations in the data with dropouts, after deleting the samples with zero values (regardless if technical or not) for the conditioned variables, are asymptotically identical to the CI relations in the original data without dropouts. This particular test-wise deletion procedure, in which we perform CI tests on the samples without zeros for the conditioned variables, can be seamlessly integrated with existing structure learning approaches including constraint-based and greedy score-based methods, thus giving rise to a principled framework for GRNI in the presence of dropouts. We further show that the causal dropout model can be validated from data, and many existing statistical models to handle dropouts fit into our model as specific parametric instances. Empirical evaluation on synthetic, curated, and real-world experimental transcriptomic data comprehensively demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1D</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gFR4QwK53h</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=gFR4QwK53h</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1D</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1D</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 7A</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6C</div></body></html>
