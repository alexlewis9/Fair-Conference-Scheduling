For this, meshes are appealing since they enable 1) fast physics-based rendering with realistic material and lighting, 2) physical simulation, and 3) are memory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing and statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being topologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D representation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin, open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for reconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material and lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation that open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we parametrize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on watertight templates. With this parametrization, we further develop a grid-based and differentiable representation that parametrizes both watertight and non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications:  differentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and generative modelling of non-watertight meshes. We empirically demonstrate that G-Shell achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-watertight mesh reconstruction and generation tasks, while also performing effectively for watertight meshes.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2B</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Ad87VjRqUw</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ad87VjRqUw</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2B</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5A</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6B</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 2B</div></body></html>
