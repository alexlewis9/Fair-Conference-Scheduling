However, the computational demands of classical algorithms for computing TDA are exorbitant, and quickly become impractical for high-order characteristics. Quantum computers offer the potential of achieving significant speedup for certain computational problems. Indeed, TDA has been purported to be one such problem, yet, quantum computing algorithms proposed for the problem, such as the original Quantum TDA (QTDA) formulation by Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi, require fault-tolerance qualifications that are currently unavailable. In this study, we present NISQ-TDA, a fully implemented end-to-end quantum machine learning algorithm needing only a short circuit-depth, that is applicable to high-dimensional classical data, and with provable asymptotic speedup for certain classes of problems. The algorithm neither suffers from the data-loading problem nor does it need to store the input data on the quantum computer explicitly. The algorithm was successfully executed on quantum computing devices, as well as on noisy quantum simulators, applied to small datasets. Preliminary empirical results suggest that the algorithm is robust to noise.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4B</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=dLrhRIMVmB</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=dLrhRIMVmB</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4B</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 7A</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4B</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 7A</div></body></html>
