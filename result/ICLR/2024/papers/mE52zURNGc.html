The solution is agnostic to the underlying feature representation and allows us to dynamically adjust the basin of convergence according to our assumptions about the uncertainty in the current estimates. These properties allow for effective control over the convergence in the alignment process.Despite using self-supervised feature embeddings, our solution achieves compelling accuracy w.r.t. the state-of-the-art direct image alignment methods trained end-to-end with pose supervision, and demonstrates improved robustness to pose initialization.Our analytical solution exposes some inherent limitations of end-to-end learning with the Gauss-Newton loss, and establishes an intriguing connection between direct image alignment and feature-matching approaches.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 7A</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=mE52zURNGc</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=mE52zURNGc</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 7A</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5A</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 8A</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6A</div></body></html>
