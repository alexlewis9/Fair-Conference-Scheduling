Membership inference algorithms approach this problem by using statistical techniques to discern whether a target sample was included in a model's training set. However, existing methods only utilize the unaltered target sample or simple augmentations of the target to compute statistics. Such a sparse sampling of the model's behavior carries little information, leading to poor inference capabilities. In this work, we use adversarial tools to directly optimize for queries that are discriminative and diverse. Our improvements achieve significantly more accurate membership inference than existing methods, especially in offline scenarios and in the low false-positive regime which is critical in legal settings.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 4: Social Aspects of Machine Learning</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=b7SBTEBFnC</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 4: Social Aspects of Machine Learning</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 4: Social Aspects of Machine Learning</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 4: Social Aspects of Machine Learning</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 4: Social Aspects of Machine Learning</div></body></html>
