Domain generalization (DG) aims to close this gap, with existing DG methods mainly focusing on the loss function design. In this paper, we propose to explore an orthogonal direction, i.e., the design of the backbone architecture. It is motivated by an empirical finding that transformer-based models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) outperform CNN-based models employing state-of-the-art (SOTA) DG algorithms on multiple DG datasets. We develop a formal framework to characterize a network's robustness to distribution shifts by studying its architecture's alignment with the correlations in the dataset. This analysis guides us to propose a novel DG model built upon vision transformers, namely \emph{Generalizable Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE)}. Extensive experiments on DomainBed demonstrate that GMoE trained with ERM outperforms SOTA DG baselines by a large margin. Moreover, GMoE is complementary to existing DG methods and its performance is substantially improved when trained with DG algorithms.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 3: Deep Learning and representational learning</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=RecZ9nB9Q4</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 3: Deep Learning and representational learning</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 3: Deep Learning and representational learning</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 3: Deep Learning and representational learning</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3 Track 5: Deep Learning and representational learning & Neuroscience and Cognitive Science</div></body></html>
