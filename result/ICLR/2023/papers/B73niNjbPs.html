This raises limitations in real-world applications like weather prediction where flexible extrapolation at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations is required. We address this problem by introducing a new data-driven approach, DINo, that models a PDE's flow with continuous-time dynamics of spatially continuous functions. This is achieved by embedding spatial observations independently of their discretization via Implicit Neural Representations in a small latent space temporally driven by a learned ODE. This separate and flexible treatment of time and space makes DINo the first data-driven model to combine the following advantages. It extrapolates at arbitrary spatial and temporal locations; it can learn from sparse irregular grids or manifolds; at test time, it generalizes to new grids or resolutions. DINo outperforms alternative neural PDE forecasters in a variety of challenging generalization scenarios on representative PDE systems.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 2: Optimization</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B73niNjbPs</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 2: Optimization</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 6: Deep Learning</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div></body></html>
