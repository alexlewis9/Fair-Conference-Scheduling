Recently, many model-based methods have been designed to address this issue, with learning in the imagination of a world model being one of the most prominent approaches. However, while virtually unlimited interaction with a simulated environment sounds appealing, the world model has to be accurate over extended periods of time. Motivated by the success of Transformers in sequence modeling tasks, we introduce IRIS, a data-efficient agent that learns in a world model composed of a discrete autoencoder and an autoregressive Transformer. With the equivalent of only two hours of gameplay in the Atari 100k benchmark, IRIS achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.046, and outperforms humans on 10 out of 26 games, setting a new state of the art for methods without lookahead search. To foster future research on Transformers and world models for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, we release our code and models at https://github.com/eloialonso/iris.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 4: Reinforcement Learning II</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=vhFu1Acb0xb</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 4: Reinforcement Learning II</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 4: Reinforcement Learning II</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 4: Reinforcement Learning II</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 4: Reinforcement Learning II</div></body></html>
