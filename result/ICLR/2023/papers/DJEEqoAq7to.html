Therefore, compressing DRL models possesses immense potential for training acceleration and model deployment. However, existing methods that generate small models mainly adopt the knowledge distillation-based approach by iteratively training a dense network. As a result, the training process still demands massive computing resources. Indeed, sparse training from scratch in DRL has not been well explored and is particularly challenging due to non-stationarity in bootstrap training. In this work, we propose a novel sparse DRL training framework, “the Rigged Reinforcement Learning Lottery” (RLx2), which builds upon gradient-based topology evolution and is capable of training a sparse DRL model based entirely on a sparse network. Specifically, RLx2 introduces a novel multi-step TD target mechanism with a dynamic-capacity replay buffer to achieve robust value learning and efficient topology exploration in sparse models. It also reaches state-of-the-art sparse training performance in several tasks, showing $7.5\times$-$20\times$ model compression with less than $3\%$ performance degradation and up to $20\times$ and $50\times$ FLOPs reduction for training and inference, respectively.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 4: Reinforcement Learning II</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=DJEEqoAq7to</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 4: Reinforcement Learning II</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 3: Reinforcement Learning I</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 6: Deep Learning and representational learning II</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 3: Reinforcement Learning I</div></body></html>
