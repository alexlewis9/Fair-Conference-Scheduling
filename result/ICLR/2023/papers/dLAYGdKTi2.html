They appear either in learning with multiple criteria where learning has to make a trade-off between multiple performance metrics such as fairness, safety and accuracy; or, in multi-task learning where multiple tasks are optimized jointly, sharing inductive bias between them. This problems are often tackled by the multi-objective optimization framework. However, existing stochastic multi-objective gradient methods and its variants (e.g., MGDA, PCGrad, CAGrad, etc.) all adopt a biased noisy gradient direction, which leads to degraded empirical performance. To this end, we develop a stochastic multi-objective gradient correction (MoCo) method for multi-objective optimization. The unique feature of our method is that it can guarantee convergence without increasing the batch size even in the nonconvex setting. Simulations on multi-task supervised and reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our method relative to the state-of-the-art methods.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 4: Applications & Optimization</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=dLAYGdKTi2</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 4: Applications & Optimization</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 1: Theory</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 2: Optimization</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 2: Optimization</div></body></html>
