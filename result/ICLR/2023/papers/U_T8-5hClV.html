Like neural network layers, these attention mechanisms are often developed by heuristics and experience. To provide a principled framework for constructing attention layers in transformers, we show that the self-attention corresponds to the support vector expansion derived from a support vector regression problem, whose primal formulation has the form of a neural network layer. Using our framework, we derive popular attention layers used in practice and propose two new attentions: 1) the Batch Normalized Attention (Attention-BN) derived from the batch normalization layer and 2)  the Attention with Scaled Head (Attention-SH) derived from using less training data to fit the SVR model. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of the Attention-BN and Attention-SH in reducing head redundancy, increasing the model's accuracy, and improving the model's efficiency in a variety of practical applications including image and time-series classification.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 5: Deep Learning and representational learning & Reinforcement Learning</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=U_T8-5hClV</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 5: Deep Learning and representational learning & Reinforcement Learning</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3 Track 4: General Machine Learning & Unsupervised and Self-supervised learning</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 5: Deep Learning and representational learning & Reinforcement Learning</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 3: Deep Learning and representational learning</div></body></html>
