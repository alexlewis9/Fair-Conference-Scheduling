An ideal solution for such a problem would be integrating both the text and graph structure information with large language models and graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the problem becomes very challenging when graphs are large due to the high computational complexity brought by training large language models and  GNNs together. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective solution to learning on large text-attributed graphs by fusing graph structure and language learning with a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, called GLEM. Instead of simultaneously training large language models and GNNs on big graphs, GLEM proposes to alternatively update the two modules in the E-step and M-step. Such a procedure allows training the two modules separately while simultaneously allowing the two modules to interact and mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments on multiple data sets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 1: Deep Learning and representational learning I</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=q0nmYciuuZN</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 1: Deep Learning and representational learning I</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 2: Optimization</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 3: Deep Learning and representational learning</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 5: Applications- & Deep Learning and representational learning</div></body></html>
