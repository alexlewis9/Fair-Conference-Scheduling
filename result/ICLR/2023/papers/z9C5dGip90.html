Predicting these classes from data remains an essential open challenge in computational physics on which existing time-series classification methods struggle. Here, we propose, phase2vec, an embedding method that learns high-quality, physically-meaningful representations of low-dimensional dynamical systems without supervision. Our embeddings are produced by a convolutional backbone that extracts geometric features from flow data and minimizes a physically-informed vector field reconstruction loss. The trained architecture can not only predict the equations of unseen data, but also produces embeddings that encode meaningful physical properties of input data (e.g. stability of fixed points, conservation of energy, and the incompressibility of flows) more faithfully than standard blackbox classifiers and state-of-the-art time series classification techniques. We additionally apply our embeddings to the analysis of meteorological data, showing we can detect climatically meaningful features. Collectively, our results demonstrate the viability of embedding approaches for the discovery of dynamical features in physical systems.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=z9C5dGip90</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 3 Track 1: Reinforcement Learning</div></body></html>
