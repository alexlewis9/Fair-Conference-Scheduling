We focus on the $\epsilon$-coreset for robust clustering, a small proxy of the dataset that preserves the clustering cost within $\epsilon$-relative error for all center sets. Our main result is an $\epsilon$-coreset of size $O(m + \mathrm{poly}(k \epsilon^{-1}))$ that can be constructed in near-linear time. This significantly improves previous results, which either suffers an exponential dependence on $(m + k)$ [Feldman and Schulman, SODA'12], or has a weaker bi-criteria guarantee [Huang et al., FOCS'18]. Furthermore, we show this dependence in $m$ is nearly-optimal, and the fact that it is isolated from other factors may be crucial for dealing with large number of outliers. We construct our coresets by adapting to the outlier setting a recent framework [Braverman et al., FOCS'22] which was designed for capacity-constrained clustering, overcoming a new challenge that the participating terms in the cost, particularly the excluded $m$ outlier points, are dependent on the center set $C$. We validate our coresets on various datasets, and we observe a superior size-accuracy tradeoff compared with popular baselines including uniform sampling and sensitivity sampling. We also achieve a significant speedup of existing approximation algorithms for robust clustering using our coresets.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 1: Theory</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Nc1ZkRW8Vde</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 1: Theory</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 1: Theory</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 5 Track 1: Unsupervised and Self-supervised learning & Social Aspects of Machine Learning-</div></body></html>
