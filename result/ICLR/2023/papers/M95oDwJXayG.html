We follow the strategy to compute several models using different hyper-parameters, and, to subsequently compute a linear aggregation of the models. While several heuristics exist that follow this strategy, methods are still missing that rely on thorough theories for bounding the target error. In this turn, we propose a method that extends weighted least squares to vector-valued functions, e.g., deep neural networks. We show that the target error of the proposed algorithm is asymptotically not worse than twice the error of the unknown optimal aggregation. We also perform a large scale empirical comparative study on several datasets, including text, images, electroencephalogram, body sensor signals and signals from mobile phones. Our method outperforms deep embedded validation (DEV) and importance weighted validation (IWV) on all datasets, setting a new state-of-the-art performance for solving parameter choice issues in unsupervised domain adaptation with theoretical error guarantees. We further study several competitive heuristics, all outperforming IWV and DEV on at least five datasets. However, our method outperforms each heuristic on at least five of seven datasets.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 3: Deep Learning and representational learning</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=M95oDwJXayG</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 3: Deep Learning and representational learning</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 3: Neuroscience and Cognitive Science & General Machine Learning</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 1: Unsupervised and Self-supervised learning</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 6 Track 6: Deep Learning</div></body></html>
