Those systems have slow-decaying Kolmogorov n-width that hinders standard methods, including reduced order modeling, from producing high-fidelity simulations at low cost. In this work, we construct hypernetwork-based latent dynamical models directly on the parameter space of a compact representation network. We leverage the expressive power of the network and a specially designed consistency-inducing regularization to obtain latent trajectories that are both low-dimensional and smooth. These properties render our surrogate models highly efficient at inference time. We show the efficacy of our framework by learning models that generate accurate multi-step rollout predictions at much faster inference speed compared to competitors, for several challenging examples.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Z4s73sJYQM</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>nan</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 4 Track 5: Machine Learning for Sciences & Probabilistic Methods</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral 1 Track 2: Machine Learning for Sciences</div></body></html>
