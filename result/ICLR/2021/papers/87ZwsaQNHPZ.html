In this paper, we attempt to explore low-precision training from a new perspective as inspired by recent findings in understanding DNN training: we conjecture that DNNs' precision might have a similar effect as the learning rate during DNN training, and advocate dynamic precision along the training trajectory for further boosting the time/energy efficiency of DNN training. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Precision Training (CPT) to cyclically vary the precision between two boundary values which can be identified using a simple precision range test within the first few training epochs. Extensive simulations and ablation studies on five datasets and eleven models demonstrate that CPT's effectiveness is consistent across various models/tasks (including classification and language modeling). Furthermore, through experiments and visualization we show that CPT helps to (1) converge to a wider minima with a lower generalization error and (2) reduce training variance which we believe opens up a new design knob for simultaneously improving the optimization and efficiency of DNN training.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=87ZwsaQNHPZ</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=87ZwsaQNHPZ</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Outstanding Paper Session 2</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 12</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Outstanding Paper Session 2</div></body></html>
