To address this gap, we introduce geometric vector perceptrons, which extend standard dense layers to operate on collections of Euclidean vectors. Graph neural networks equipped with such layers are able to perform both geometric and relational reasoning on efficient representations of macromolecules. We demonstrate our approach on two important problems in learning from protein structure: model quality assessment and computational protein design. Our approach improves over existing classes of architectures on both problems, including state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks. We release our code at https://github.com/drorlab/gvp.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=1YLJDvSx6J4</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=1YLJDvSx6J4</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 7</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 3</div></body></html>
