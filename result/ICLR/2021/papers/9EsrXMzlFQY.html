Recent work has shown its state-of-the-art performance when combined with pre-trained deep denoisers. However, current RED algorithms are inadequate for parallel processing on multicore systems. We address this issue by proposing a new{asynchronous RED (Async-RED) algorithm that enables asynchronous parallel processing of data, making it significantly faster than its serial counterparts for large-scale inverse problems. The computational complexity of Async-RED is further reduced by using a random subset of measurements at every iteration. We present a complete theoretical analysis of the algorithm by establishing its convergence under explicit assumptions on the data-fidelity and the denoiser. We validate Async-RED on image recovery using pre-trained deep denoisers as priors.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 6</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=9EsrXMzlFQY</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=9EsrXMzlFQY</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 6</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 12</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 8</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 6</div></body></html>
