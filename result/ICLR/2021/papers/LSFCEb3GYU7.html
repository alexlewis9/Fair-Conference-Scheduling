Deep neural network algorithms have proven to be a powerful tool for learning directly from high-dimensional data, but currently lack this capacity for data-efficient induction of abstract rules, leading some to argue that symbol-processing mechanisms will be necessary to account for this capacity. In this work, we take a step toward bridging this gap by introducing the Emergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN), a recurrent network augmented with an external memory that enables a form of variable-binding and indirection. This binding mechanism allows symbol-like representations to emerge through the learning process without the need to explicitly incorporate symbol-processing machinery, enabling the ESBN to learn rules in a manner that is abstracted away from the particular entities to which those rules apply. Across a series of tasks, we show that this architecture displays nearly perfect generalization of learned rules to novel entities given only a limited number of training examples, and outperforms a number of other competitive neural network architectures.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LSFCEb3GYU7</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=LSFCEb3GYU7</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 8</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div></body></html>
