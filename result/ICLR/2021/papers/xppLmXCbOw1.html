However, acquiring these skills using only a stream of high-dimensional, unstructured, and unlabeled observations is a tricky challenge for any autonomous agent. Previous methods have used variational autoencoders to encode a scene into a low-dimensional vector that can be used as a goal for an agent to discover new skills. Nevertheless, in compositional/multi-object environments it is difficult to disentangle all the factors of variation into such a fixed-length representation of the whole scene. We propose to use object-centric representations as a modular and structured observation space, which is learned with a compositional generative world model.
We show that the structure in the representations in combination with goal-conditioned attention policies helps the autonomous agent to discover and learn useful skills. These skills can be further combined to address compositional tasks like the manipulation of several different objects.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 10</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=xppLmXCbOw1</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=xppLmXCbOw1</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 10</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 8</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 10</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 11</div></body></html>
