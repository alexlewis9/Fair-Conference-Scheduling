Instead of tackling the problem by training task-specific discriminative classifiers, we frame it as a translation task between augmented natural languages, from which the task-relevant information can be easily extracted. Our approach can match or outperform task-specific models on all tasks, and in particular achieves new state-of-the-art results on joint entity and relation extraction (CoNLL04, ADE, NYT, and ACE2005 datasets), relation classification (FewRel and TACRED), and semantic role labeling (CoNLL-2005 and CoNLL-2012). We accomplish this while using the same architecture and hyperparameters for all tasks, and even when training a single model to solve all tasks at the same time (multi-task learning). Finally, we show that our framework can also significantly improve the performance in a low-resource regime, thanks to better use of label semantics.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 3</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=US-TP-xnXI</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=US-TP-xnXI</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 3</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div></body></html>
