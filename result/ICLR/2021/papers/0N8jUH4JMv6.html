More specifically, we develop a convex analytic framework utilizing semi-infinite duality to obtain equivalent convex optimization problems for several two- and three-layer CNN architectures. We first prove that two-layer CNNs can be globally optimized via an $\ell_2$ norm regularized convex program. We then show that multi-layer circular CNN training problems with a single ReLU layer are equivalent to an $\ell_1$ regularized convex program that encourages sparsity in the spectral domain. We also extend these results to three-layer CNNs with two ReLU layers. Furthermore, we present extensions of our approach to different pooling methods, which elucidates the implicit architectural bias as convex regularizers.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=0N8jUH4JMv6</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=0N8jUH4JMv6</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 8</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 3</div></body></html>
