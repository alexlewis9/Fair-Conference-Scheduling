Regularized IRLapplies strongly convex regularizers to the learner’s policy in order to avoid the expert’s behavior being rationalized by arbitrary constant rewards, also known as degenerate solutions. We propose tractable solutions, and practical methods to obtain them, for regularized IRL. Current methods are restricted to the maximum-entropy IRL framework, limiting them to Shannon-entropy regularizers, as well as proposing solutions that are intractable in practice.  We present theoretical backing for our proposed IRL method’s applicability to both discrete and continuous controls, empirically validating our performance on a variety of tasks.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HgLO8yalfwc</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=HgLO8yalfwc</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 10</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 10</div></body></html>
