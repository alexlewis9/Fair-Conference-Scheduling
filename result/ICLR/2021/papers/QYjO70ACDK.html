However, SW requires many unnecessary projection samples to approximate its value while Max-SW only uses the most important projection, which ignores the information of other useful directions. In order to account for these weaknesses, we propose a novel distance, named Distributional Sliced-Wasserstein distance (DSW), that finds an optimal distribution over projections that can balance between exploring distinctive projecting directions and the informativeness of projections themselves. We show that the DSW is a generalization of Max-SW, and it can be computed efficiently by searching for the optimal push-forward measure over a set of probability measures over the unit sphere satisfying certain regularizing constraints that favor distinct directions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with large-scale datasets to demonstrate the favorable performances of the proposed distances over the previous sliced-based distances in generative modeling applications.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 12</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=QYjO70ACDK</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=QYjO70ACDK</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 12</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 7</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 11</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 12</div></body></html>
