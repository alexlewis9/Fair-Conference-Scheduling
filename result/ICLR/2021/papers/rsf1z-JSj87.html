In this work, we take on the challenging task of learning to synthesise speech from normalised text or phonemes in an end-to-end manner, resulting in models which operate directly on character or phoneme input sequences and produce raw speech audio outputs. Our proposed generator is feed-forward and thus efficient for both training and inference, using a differentiable alignment scheme based on token length prediction. It learns to produce high fidelity audio through a combination of adversarial feedback and prediction losses constraining the generated audio to roughly match the ground truth in terms of its total duration and mel-spectrogram. To allow the model to capture temporal variation in the generated audio, we employ soft dynamic time warping in the spectrogram-based prediction loss. The resulting model achieves a mean opinion score exceeding 4 on a 5 point scale, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art models relying on multi-stage training and additional supervision.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rsf1z-JSj87</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=rsf1z-JSj87</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div></body></html>
