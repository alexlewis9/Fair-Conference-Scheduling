Previous defense methods capture word substitutions in vector space by using either l_2-ball or hyper-rectangle, which results in perturbation sets that are not inclusive enough or unnecessarily large, and thus impedes mimicry of worst cases for robust training. In this paper, we introduce a novel Adversarial Sparse Convex Combination (ASCC) method. We model the word substitution attack space as a convex hull and leverages a regularization term to enforce perturbation towards an actual substitution, thus aligning our modeling better with the discrete textual space. Based on  ASCC method, we further propose ASCC-defense, which leverages ASCC to generate worst-case perturbations and incorporates adversarial training towards robustness. Experiments show that ASCC-defense outperforms the current state-of-the-arts in terms of robustness on two prevailing NLP tasks, i.e., sentiment analysis and natural language inference, concerning several attacks across multiple model architectures. Besides, we also envision a new class of defense towards robustness in NLP, where our robustly trained word vectors can be plugged into a normally trained model and enforce its robustness without applying any other defense techniques.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ks5nebunVn_</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=ks5nebunVn_</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 7</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 7</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 2</div></body></html>
