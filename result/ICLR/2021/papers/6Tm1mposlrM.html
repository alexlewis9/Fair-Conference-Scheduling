Indeed, optimizing only the training loss value, as is commonly done, can easily lead to suboptimal model quality. Motivated by the connection between geometry of the loss landscape and generalization---including a generalization bound that we prove here---we introduce a novel, effective procedure for instead simultaneously minimizing loss value and loss sharpness.  In particular, our procedure, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), seeks parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss; this formulation results in a min-max optimization problem on which gradient descent can be performed efficiently. We present empirical results showing that SAM improves model generalization across a variety of benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-{10, 100}, ImageNet, finetuning tasks) and models, yielding novel state-of-the-art performance for several.  Additionally, we find that SAM natively provides robustness to label noise on par with that provided by state-of-the-art procedures that specifically target learning with noisy labels.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 2</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6Tm1mposlrM</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=6Tm1mposlrM</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 2</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 11</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 12</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 2</div></body></html>
