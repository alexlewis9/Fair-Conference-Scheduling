Inspired by the ability of these systems to express a rich set of outputs while keeping (gradients of) state variables bounded, we propose a novel architecture for recurrent neural networks. Our proposed RNN is based on a time-discretization of a system of second-order ordinary differential equations, modeling networks of controlled nonlinear oscillators. We prove precise bounds on the gradients of the hidden states, leading to the mitigation of the exploding and vanishing gradient problem for this RNN. Experiments show that the proposed RNN is comparable in performance to the state of the art on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of this architecture to provide stable and accurate RNNs for processing complex sequential data.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 8</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=F3s69XzWOia</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=F3s69XzWOia</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 8</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 8</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 10</div></body></html>
