The problem occurs in many applications, including biology, genomics, computer systems and linguistics. A line of research spanning the last decade resulted in algorithms that estimate the support up to $ \pm \varepsilon n$ from a sample of size $O(\log^2(1/\varepsilon) \cdot n/\log n)$, where $n$ is the data set size.  Unfortunately, this bound is known to be tight, limiting further improvements to the complexity of this problem. In this paper we consider estimation algorithms augmented with a machine-learning-based predictor that, given any element, returns an estimation of  its frequency.  We show that if the predictor is correct up to a constant approximation factor, then the sample complexity can be reduced significantly,  to
$$ \ \log (1/\varepsilon) \cdot n^{1-\Theta(1/\log(1/\varepsilon))}. $$
We evaluate the proposed algorithms on a collection of data sets, using the neural-network based estimators from {Hsu et al, ICLR'19} as predictors. Our experiments  demonstrate substantial (up to 3x) improvements in the estimation accuracy compared to the state of the art algorithm.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=tilovEHA3YS</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=tilovEHA3YS</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 12</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 5</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 6</div></body></html>
