With ever increasing data set sizes, a trivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between interacting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are well suited for this problem, but multi-variate models often assume a simple parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we model the multi-variate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive deep learning model, where the data distribution  is represented by a conditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the future, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it improves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data sets with several thousand interacting time-series.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=WiGQBFuVRv</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=WiGQBFuVRv</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 7</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 1</div></body></html>
