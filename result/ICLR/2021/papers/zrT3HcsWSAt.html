Popular imitation learning algorithms, such as generative adversarial imitation learning, assume that (clear) demonstrations are given from optimal expert policies but not the non-optimal ones, and thus often fail to imitate the optimal expert behaviors given the noisy demonstrations. Prior works that address the problem require (1) learning policies through environment interactions in the same fashion as reinforcement learning, and (2) annotating each demonstration with confidence scores or rankings. However, such environment interactions and annotations in real-world settings take impractically long training time and a significant human effort. In this paper, we propose an imitation learning algorithm to address the problem without any environment interactions and annotations associated with the non-optimal demonstrations. The proposed algorithm learns ensemble policies with a generalized behavioral cloning (BC) objective function where we exploit another policy already learned by BC. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can learn behavior policies that are much closer to the optimal policies than ones learned by BC.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=zrT3HcsWSAt</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=zrT3HcsWSAt</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 9</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 10</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 8</div></body></html>
