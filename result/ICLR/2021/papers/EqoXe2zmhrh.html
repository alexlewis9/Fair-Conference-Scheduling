We posit that this last behaviour is too strict, enforcing dissimilar representations even for samples that are semantically-related – for example, visually similar videos or ones that share the same depicted action. In this paper, we propose a novel method that alleviates this by leveraging a generative model to naturally push these related samples together: each sample’s caption must be reconstructed as a weighted combination of a support set of visual representations. This simple idea ensures that representations are not overly-specialized to individual samples, are reusable across the dataset, and results in representations that explicitly encode semantics shared between samples, unlike noise contrastive learning. Our proposed method outperforms others by a large margin on MSR-VTT, VATEX, ActivityNet, and MSVD for video-to-text and text-to-video retrieval.</div><h4>session</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 7</div><h4>pdf_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=EqoXe2zmhrh</div><h4>openreview_url</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=EqoXe2zmhrh</div><h4>Baseline</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 7</div><h4>GreedyCohesive</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 4</div><h4>KMedoids</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 3</div><h4>KMeans</h4><div style='margin-bottom:1em'>Oral Session 7</div></body></html>
