Abstract
Reconstruction of static visual stimuli from non-invasion brain activity fMRI
achieves great success, owning to advanced deep learning models such as CLIP
and Stable Diffusion. However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction
remains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous visual
experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to addressing these
challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level semantics and low-level per-
ception flows, as perceived by the brain in response to video stimuli. To the end, we
propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth
video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video
keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception
reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness.
During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both
keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a
publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity
video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over
state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM
and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics. Our project is available at

Introduction
Decoding visual stimuli from neural activity is crucial and prospective to unraveling the intricate
mechanisms of the human brain. In the context of non-invasive approaches, visual reconstruction
from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), such as fMRI-to-image reconstruction, shows
high fidelity [1, 2, 3, 4], largely benefiting from advanced deep learning models such as CLIP [5, 6]
and Stable Diffusion [7]. This convergence of brain science and deep learning presents a promising
data-driven learning paradigm to explore a comprehensive understanding of the advanced perceptual
and semantic functions of the cerebral cortex. Unfortunately, fMRI-to-video reconstruction still
presents significant hurdles that discourage researchers, since decoding the spatiotemporal perception
of a continuous flow of scenes, motions, and objects is formidably challenging.
At first glance, fMRI measures blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals by snapshotting a
few seconds of brain activity, leading to differential temporal resolutions between fMRI (low) and

videos (high). The previously advisable solution to address such differential granularity is to perform
self-interpolation on fMRI and downsample video frames to pre-align fMRI and videos. Going
further, decoding accurate high-level semantics and low-level perception flows has a more profound
impact on the ability to reconstruct high-fidelity videos from brain activity. Early studies before 2022
struggled with achieving satisfactory reconstruction performance, as they failed to acquire precise
semantics from powerful (pre-trained) diffusion models. The latest research MinD-Video [8] guides
the diffusion model conditioned on visual fMRI features, making an initial attempt to address the
semantic issue. However, it lacks a design of low-level visual detailing, so it significantly diverges
from the brain’s visual system, exhibiting limitations in perceiving continuous low-level visual details.
The brain’s reflection of video stimuli is a crucial factor that influences and enlightens the visual
decoding of fMRI-to-video reconstruction. Notably, the human brain perceives videos discreetly [9,
10] due to the persistence of vision [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and delayed memory [16]. It is impractical to
perceive every video frame, and instead, only keyframes elicit significant responses in the brain’s
visual system. Reconstructing keyframes from fMRI avoids the issue of differential temporal
resolutions between fMRI and videos. Also, the precise semantics and perceptual details in keyframes
ensure the high fidelity and smoothness of reconstructed videos, both within and across successive
fMRI inputs. Accordingly, we argue that utilizing keyframe images as anchors for transitional video
reconstruction aligns with the brain’s cognitive mechanisms and holds greater promise.
However, relying solely on manipulating fMRI-to-image models, e.g., incorporated with spatiotem-
poral conditions for successive image reconstruction, to generate keyframes, easily yields suboptimal
outcomes. Research dating back to as early as 1960 [17] has shown that the fleeting sequence of
images perceived by the retina is hardly discernible during the process of perception. Instead, what
emerges is a phenomenal scene or its intriguing features, which can be regarded as non-detailed,
low-level images. Initially, the retina captures these low-level perceptions, and subsequently, the
higher central nervous system in the brain focuses on and pursues the details, generating high-level
images in the cerebral cortex [18]. This process is reflected in the fMRI signal [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
The video-to-fMRI process naturally incorporates a combination of both low-level and high-level
images. Therefore, the reverse fMRI-to-video reconstruction intuitively benefits from taking into
account both the high-level semantic features and the low-level perceptual features. Specifically, it
is necessary to decode the low-level perception flows, such as motions and dynamic scenes, from
brain activity to complement keyframes, which enhances the reconstruction of high-fidelity frames
and produces smooth videos.
In light of the above discussion, we propose a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework
NeuroClips that introduces two trainable components of Perception Reconstructor and Semantics
Reconstructor for reconstructing low-level perception flows and keyframes, respectively. 1) Percep-
tion Reconstructor introduces Inception Extension and Temporal Upsampling modules to adaptively
align fMRI with video frames, decoding low-level perception flows, i.e., a blurry video. This blurry
video ensures the smoothness and consistency of subsequent video reconstruction. 2) Semantics
Reconstructor adopts a diffusion prior and multiple training strategies to concentrate quantities of
high-level semantics from various modalities into fMRI embeddings. These fMRI embeddings are
mapped to the CLIP image space and decoded to reconstruct high-quality keyframes. 3) During infer-
ence, NeuroClips adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with keyframes and low-level
perception flows for video reconstruction with high fidelity, smoothness, and consistency.
Extensive experiments have validated the superior performance of NeuroClips, which is substantially
ahead of SOTA baselines in pixel-level metrics and video consistency. NeuroClips achieves a 0.219
improvement (128%) in SSIM and a 0.330 improvement (81%) in spatiotemporal metrics and also
performs better overall on most video semantic-level metrics. Meanwhile, using multi-fMRI fusion,
NeuroClips pioneers the exploration of longer video reconstruction up to 6s at 8FPS.

2.1
Visual Reconstruction
After its initial exploration [25], static image reconstruction from fMRI has witnessed remarkable
success in recent years. Due to the lack of information in fMRI adapted to deep learning models,
a path has been gradually explored that aligns fMRI to specific modal representations such as the
common image and text modality [26, 27, 28, 29], and CLIP’s [5] rich representation of space is
2

pretty favored. Then, the aligned representations can then be fed into the diffusion model to complete
the image generation. Along this path, a large body of literature demonstrates that reconstructing
images at both pixel level and semantic level achieves great results [1, 2, 4, 30]. However, the field of
fMRI-to-video reconstruction remains largely unexplored. Early studies [31, 32, 33] attempted to
reconstruct low-level visual content from fMRI, using the embedded fMRI as conditions to guide
GANs or AEs in generating multiple static images. The reconstructed videos contained little to no
clear semantics recognizable by humans. Due to the excellent performance of diffusion models,
MinD-Video [8] reconstructed 3FPS videos from fMRI. Despite this success, the smoothness and
semantic accuracy of these videos remain unsatisfactory, leaving substantial space for improvement.
2.2
Video Diffusion Model
Diffusion models for image generation have gained significant attention in research communities
recently [34, 35, 36]. DALLE·2 [37] improved text-image generation by leveraging the CLIP [5] joint
representation space. Stable Diffusion [7] enhanced generation efficiency by moving the diffusion
process to the latent space of VQVAE [38]. To achieve customized generation with trained diffusion
models, many works focused on adding extra condition control networks, such as ControlNet [39] and
T2I-Adapter [40]. In the realm of video generation, it is typical to extend existing diffusion models
with temporal modeling [41, 42, 43]. Animatediff [44] trained a plug-and-play motion module that
can be seamlessly integrated into any customized image diffusion model to form a video generator.
Stable Video Diffusion [45] fine-tunes pre-trained diffusion models using high-quality video datasets
from multiple views to achieve powerful generation.

Method
The overall framework of NeuroClips is illustrated in Figure 1. NeuroClips consists of three essential
components: 1) Perception Reconstructor (PR) generates the blurry but continuous rough video
from the perceptual level while ensuring consistency between its consecutive frames. 2) Semantics
Reconstructor (SR) reconstructs the high-quality keyframe image from the semantic level. 3)
Inference Process is the fMRI-to-video reconstruction process, which employs a T2V diffusion
model and combines the reconstructions from PR and SR to reconstruct the final exquisite video with
high fidelity, smoothness, and consistency. Furthermore, NeuroClips also pioneers the exploration of
Multi-fMRI Fusion for longer video reconstruction.

3.1
Perception Reconstructor
Perception reconstruction is essential not only for video reconstruction but also for semantics re-
construction. Additionally, smoothness and consistency are crucial metrics of video quality, and
Perception Reconstructor (PR) plays a key role in ensuring these attributes.

We split a video into several clips at two-second intervals (i.e., fMRI time resolution). For each
clip c, we downsample it and retain part frames at fixed intervals, resulting in a set of frames
X = [X1, X2, · · · , XNf ]. Xi is the i-th retained frame image, with a total of Nf retained frames. Yc
is the corresponding fMRI signal of clip c. Here we introduce Inception Extension module to extend
one fMRI to Nf fMRIs, denoted as Yc →Y, Y = [Y1, Y2, · · · , YNf ].
Sequentially applying a simple MLP and Temporal Upsampling module to obtain Y’s embedding
set EY = [eY1, eY2, · · · , eYNf ], which can be fed into the Stable Diffusion [7] VAE decoder to
produce a series of blurry images. We regard this sequence of blurry images as blurry video. We
expect the blurry video to lack semantic content, but to exhibit state-of-the-art perceptual metrics,
such as position, shape, scene, etc. Thus, we consider using frame set X to align Y.
Training Loss. Mapping X to the latent space of Stable Diffusion’s VAE to obtain the perception em-
bedding set EX = [eX1, eX2, · · · , eXNf ]. We adopt mean absolute error (MAE) loss and contrastive
loss to train the PR, the overall loss LP R of PR can be described as:

where τ is a temperature hyper-parameter. The function sim(, ) is used to compute the similarity.
Temporal Upsampling. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI, the direct alignment of fMRI
to VAE’s pixel space is highly susceptible to overfitting noise, and the learning task is too complex to
guarantee the generation of decent blurry images. A common method is aligning to a coarser-grained
pixel space and then upsampling to a fine-grained pixel space. The temporal relationship of the
frames also needs to be considered in the video task to maintain consistency. Therefore, to achieve
consistency between the retained frames, we integrated temporal attention into the upsampling
operation. The fMRI embedding EY has five dimensions, i.e. EY ∈Rb×Nf ×c×h×w, where b
denotes the batch size, c × h × w is the dimension of embedding space. The upsampling operation
merely models spatial relationship, receiving reshaped embedding Espat
Y
∈R(b×Nf )×c×h×w as input.
To model temporal relationship of Nf fMRI, we first reshape EY as Etemp
Y
∈R(b×h×w)×Nf ×c.
Then, we use learnable mapping to compute the query value Q = W QEtemp
Y
and the key value
K = W KEtemp
Y
. Finally, the output of temporal attention layer is E′
Y = Softmax( Q⊤K
√c ) · Etemp
Y
.
We utilize a learnable mixing coefficient η to conduct residual connection:
EY = η · Etemp
Y
+ (1 −η) · E′
Y.

Based on the above design, PR generates the blurry rough video with initial smoothness and great
consistency, laying the foundation for subsequent video reconstruction.
3.2
Semantics Reconstructor
Recent cognitive neuroscience studies [46, 47] argue that ’key-frames’ play a crucial role in how the
human brain recalls and connects relevant memories with unfolding events, and other research [48, 49]
also demonstrates that video key-frames can be used as representative features of the entire video clip.
Building on these conclusions, the core objective of Semantics Reconstructor (SR) is to reconstruct a
high-quality keyframe image that can be used to address the issue of frame rate mismatch between
visual stimuli and fMRI signals, thereby enhancing the fidelity of the final exquisite video. The
existing fMRI-to-image reconstruction studies [1, 2, 4] facilitate our objective, detailed below:
fMRI Low-dimensional Processing. For each clip c, its corresponding fMRI signal is Yc. We use
ridge regression to map Yc to a lower-dimensional Y′
c for easier follow-up:
Y′
c = X(XT X + λI)−1XT Yc,
(3)
where X is design matrix, λ is regularization parameter, and I is identity matrix. Although the human
brain processes information in a highly complex and non-linear way, empirical evidence [1, 26, 2]
4

underscores the effectiveness and sufficiency of linear mapping for achieving desirable reconstruction,
due to nonlinear models will easily overfit to fMRI noise and then lead to poor performance [50].
Alignment of Keyframe Image with fMRI. Randomly choose one frame in the clip c as its keyframe
Xc, and use OpenCLIP ViT-bigG/14 [51] to obtain eXc, the embedding of keyframe image Xc in
CLIP image space. eYc is the fMRI embedding of Y′
c via another MLP. Consequently, we perform
contrastive learning between eXc and eYc to align the keyframe image Xc and the fMRI Yc, resulting
in enhancing the semantics of eYc. It is worth noting that the MLP gets a bidirectional contrastive
loss. Previous research [1] has demonstrated that introducing MixCo [52] data augmentation, an
extension of mixup utilizing the InfoNCE loss, can effectively help model convergence, especially for
scarce fMRI samples. Therefore, the bidirectional loss called BiMixCo LBiMixCo, which combines
MixCo and contrastive loss, needs to be used for training.
Generation of Reconstruction-Embedding. Since the embeddings in the CLIP ViT image space
are more approximate to real images compared to fMRI embeddings, transforming fMRI embedding
eYc into CLIP ViT’s image embedding will significantly benefit the reconstruction quality of the
keyframe. Therefore, we have to generate the reconstruction-embedding ere
Xc for the keyframe image
Xc, essentially, which is the image embedding that will be fed to the subsequent generative model for
reconstruction. Inspired by DALLE·2 [37], diffusion prior is an effective approach to transforming
embedding. So, we map the fMRI embedding eYc to the OpenCLIP ViT-bigG/14 image space to
generate ere
Xc. Here, we use the same prior loss LPrior in DALLE·2 [37] for training.
Reconstruction Enhancement from Text Modality. Original fMRI-to-image reconstruction only
relies on visual modality embedding. For instance, reconstructing images conditional on the image
embeddings generated by diffusion prior. However, text is another critical modality. Incorporating
text with higher semantic density can help improve the semantic content of reconstruction embedding,
resulting in making semantics reconstruction more straightforward and effective. We adopt BLIP-
2 [53] to introduce the text modality, i.e., the caption Tc of the keyframe images Xc. Then, we embed
Tc to obtain the text embedding eTc. Inspired by contrastive learning, we perform contrastive learning
between ere
Xc and eTc to enhance reconstruction-embedding ere
Xc via additional text modality. The
contrastive loss serves as the training loss LReftm of this process, similar to Equation 1, omitted here.
Training Loss. As discussed above, the overall training loss LSR in SR is composite. Therefore, We
set mixing coefficients δ and µ to balance multiple losses:
LSR = LBiMixCo + δLPrior + µLReftm.
(4)
3.3
Inference Process
The inference of NeuroClips is the process of fMRI-to-video reconstruction. We jointly utilize the
blurry rough video, the high-quality keyframe image, and the additional text modality, which are
α, β, and γ guidance, to reconstruct the final exquisite video with high fidelity, smoothness, and
consistency. And we employ a text-to-video diffusion model to help reconstruct video.
Text-to-video Diffusion Model. Pre-training text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models possess a signifi-
cant amount of prior knowledge from the graphics, image, and video domains. However, like other
diffusion models, they face huge challenges in achieving controllable generation. Therefore, directly
using the text corresponding to fMRI to reconstruct videos will result in unsatisfactory outcomes,
as the semantics of embeddings only originate from the text modality. We also need to enhance the
embeddings with semantics from the video and image modalities to produce "composite semantics"
embeddings, which aid in achieving controllable generation for the T2V diffusion model.
α Guidance. We consider the blurry rough-video Vblurry output from PR as α Guidance. Treating
Vblurry as an intermediate noisy video between target video V0 and noise video VT , the originally
required T steps for the complete forward process can now be reduced to ϑT steps. By applying the
latent space translation and reparameterization trick, noise zT can be formalized as:
zT =
p
¯αT /¯αϑT zblurry +
p
1 −¯αT /¯αϑT ϵ,
¯αT =
T
Y
t=1
αt,
¯αϑT =
ϑT
Y
t=1
αt,
(5)
where αt represents the noise schedule parameter at time step t and ϵ ∼N(0, 1) is Gaussian noise.
The reverse process involves iteratively denoising the noise video from T steps back to 0 steps.
5

Adopting a pretrained T2V diffusion model pθ to predict the mean and variance of the denoising
distribution at each step:
zt−1 ∼pθ(zt−1|zt) = N(zt−1; µθ(zt, t), Σθ(zt, t)),
(6)
where t = T, T −1, ..., 1. After translating z0 to pixel space, the reconstructed video V0 is obtained.
β Guidance. α Guidance only directs the video generation of the T2V diffusion model at the percep-
tion level, leading to significant randomness in the semantics of the reconstructed videos. To resolve
this issue, we need to incorporate keyframe images with more supplementary semantics to control the
generation process, thereby enhancing the fidelity of the reconstructed videos. Compared to directly
reconstructing keyframe images from fMRI embeddings, combining perception embeddings will be
more beneficial for maintaining the consistency of structural and semantic information. Therefore,
we select the first frame V1 of blurry Vblurry. Input V1’s embedding and fMRI embedding to SDXL
unCLIP [2] (See Appendix D for more discussion about SDXL unCLIP) in SR to reconstruct the
keyframe image Xkey as β Guidance. We employ ControlNet [54] to add β Guidance to the T2V
diffusion model, in which the keyframes are used as the first-frame to guide video generation.
γ Guidance. The text is the necessary input for the T2V diffusion model. In order to maintain the
consistency of visual semantics, we adopt BLIP-2 [53] to generate the caption for the keyframe image
Xkey, which is used as γ Guidance (prompt) for video reconstruction.
The inference process inputs α, β, γ Guidance into the T2V diffusion model, and the fMRI-to-video
reconstruction can be completed, resulting in the exquisite video with high fidelity and smoothness.
3.4
Multi-fMRI Fusion
While it is important to emphasize that single-frame fMRI generates higher frame rate video, the
more realistic question is how to recover longer video (longer than fMRI temporal resolution).
Previous methods treat single-frame fMRI as a sample, and temporal attention is computed at
the single-frame fMRI level, thus failing to generate coherent videos longer than 2s. With the
help of NeuroClips’ SR, we explored the generation of longer videos for the first time. Current
video generative models are built on diffusion-based image generation models and attention-based
transformer architectures, both of which incur significant computational overhead. As the number
of frames increases, the content scales linearly, highlighting the limitations in generating long and
complex videos efficiently. Therefore, we chose a more straightforward fusion strategy that does
not require additional GPU training. In the inference process, we consider the semantic similarity
of two reconstructed keyframes from two neighboring fMRI samples (here we directly determine
whether they belong to the same class of objects, e.g., both are jellyfish). Specifically, we obtain the
CLIP representations of reconstructed neighboring keyframes and train a shallow MLP based on the
representations to distinguish whether two frames share the same class. If semantically similar, we
replace the keyframe of the latter fMRI with the tail-frame of the former fMRI’s reconstructed video,
which will be taken as the first-frame of the latter fMRI to generate the video. As shown in Figure 2,
with this strategy, we achieved continuous video reconstruction of up to 6s for the first time.
Figure 2: Visualization of Multi-fMRI fusion. With the semantic relevance measure, we can generate video clips
up to 6s long without any additional training.

Experimental Setup
4.1
Dataset and Pre-processing
Dataset. In this study, we performed fMRI-to-video reconstruction experiments using the open-
source fMRI-video dataset (cc2017 dataset1) [31]. For each subject, the training and testing video
clips were presented 2 and 10 times, respectively, and the testing set was averaged across trials.
The dataset consists of a training set containing 18 8-minute video clips and a test set containing 5
8-minute video clips. The MRI (T1 and T2-weighted) and fMRI data (with 2s temporal resolution)
were collected using a 3-T MRI system. Thus there are 8640 training samples and 1200 testing
samples of fMRI-video pairs.
Pre-processing. The fMRI data on the cc2017 were preprocessed using the minimal preprocessing
pipeline [55]. The fMRI volumes underwent artifact removal, motion correction (6 DOF), registration
to standard space (MNI space), and were further transformed onto the cortical surfaces, which were
coregistered onto a cortical surface template [56]. We calculated the voxel-wise correlation between
the fMRI voxel signals of each training movie repetition for each subject. The correlation coefficient
for each voxel underwent Fisher z-transformation, and the average z scores across 18 training movie
segments were tested using the one-sample t-test. The significant voxels (Bonferroni correction, P <
0.05) were considered to be stimulus-activated voxels and used for subsequent analysis A total of
13447, 14828, and 9114 activated voxels were observed in the visual cortex for the three subjects.
Following the previous works [3, 57, 58], we used the BOLD signals with a delay of 4 seconds as the
movie stimulus responses to account for the hemodynamic delay.
4.2
Implementation Details
In this paper, videos from the cc2017 dataset were downsampled from 30FPS to 3FPS to make a fair
comparison with the previous methods, and the blurred video was interpolated to 8FPS to generate the
final 8FPS video during inference. We split semantic reconstruction into two parts: image contrastive
learning and the fine-tuning of the diffusion prior to adapting to the new image distribution space.
In PR, all downsampled frames were utilized, and the inception extension was implemented by a
shallow MLP. Theoretically, our approach can be used in any text-to-video diffusion model, and
we choose the open-source available AnimateDiff [44] as our inference model. ϑ is set to 0.3 in
α Guidance, and the inference is performed with 25 DDIM [35] steps (See Appendix A for more
implementation details). All experiments were conducted using a single A100 GPU.
4.3
Evaluation Metrics
We conduct the quantitative assessments through frame-based and video-based metrics. Frame-based
metrics evaluate each frame individually, providing a snapshot evaluation, whereas video-based
metrics evaluate the quality of the video, emphasizing the consistency and smoothness of the video
frame sequence. Both are used for a comprehensive analysis from a semantic or pixel perspective.
Frame-based Metrics We evaluate frames at the pixel level and semantic level. We use the structural
similarity index measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) as the pixel-level metric
and the N-way top-K accuracy classification test (total 1,000 image classes from ImageNet [59]) as
the semantics-level metric. To conduct the classification test, we essentially compare the ground truth
(GT) classification results with the predicted frame (PF) results using an ImageNet classifier [30, 8].
We consider the trial successful if the GT class is among the top-K probabilities in the PF classification
results (We used top-1), selected from N randomly chosen classes that include the GT class. The
reported success rate is based on the results of 100 repeated tests.
Video-based Metrics We evaluate videos at the semantic level and spatiotemporal(ST)-level. For
semantic-level metrics, a similar classification test (total 400 video classes from the Kinetics-400
dataset [60]) is used above, with a video classifier based on VideoMAE [61]. For spatiotemporal-level
metrics that measure video consistency, we compute CLIP image embeddings on each frame of the
predicted videos and report the average cosine similarity between all pairs of adjacent video frames,
which is the common metric CLIP-pcc in video editing.

Results
In this section, we compare NeuroClips with previous video reconstruction methods on the cc2017
dataset. We provide a visual comparison in Figure 3 and report quantitative metrics in Table 1. We
purposely focus on the comparison with the previous SOTA method on the right side of Figure 3 due
to the lack of obvious semantic information in the premature method. All methods report results
for all test sets except Wen [31], whose results are available for only one segment. Our method
generates videos at 8fps and even higher frame rates. For a fair comparison with previous studies,
we downsampled the 8FPS videos to 3FPS. Unless otherwise noted, the experimental results and
visualizations shown below are all at 3FPS.
As can be seen in Figure 3, earlier methods were unable to produce videos with complete semantics
but guaranteed some of the low-level visual features. Compared to MinD-Video, our NeuroClips
generates single-frame images with higher quality, more precise semantics (e.g., people, turtles, and
airplanes), and smoother movements. At the same time, due to the limited data in the training set,
some objects in the test set videos did not appear in the training set, such as the moon, and perfect
reproduction of the semantics is difficult. However, thanks to our perception reconstructor (aka α
Guidance), NeuroClips basically reproduces the shape and motion trajectory of the moon, although
semantically it is more similar to the aperture, demonstrating the pixel-level reconstruction ability

of the video. In terms of quantitative metrics, NeuroClips significantly outperformed 5 of the 7
metrics, with a 128% improvement in SSIM performance, indicating that the PR complements the
lack of pixel-level control. At the semantic level, our metrics overall outperform previous methods,
demonstrating the better semantic alignment paradigm of NeuroClips. For the ST-level metric, which
evaluates video smoothness, NeuroClips substantially outperforms MinD-Video because we introduce
blurry rough-video (aka α Guidance) for the frozen video generation model, incorporating initial
smoothness for video reconstruction. In contrast, MinD-Video lacks perception control, resulting in a
substantial decrease in smoothness, as can also be seen in Figure 3, where the human deformations
and scene switches are too large within an fMRI frame. In addition, benefiting from our keyframes
for first-frame guidance (aka β Guidance) and blurry videos, we can connect semantically similar
videos to generate longer videos, which may be the reason for the slightly lower video 2-way metrics,
as neighboring reconstructed videos are more similar after multi-fMRI fusion.

Ablations
Figure 4: Visualization of ablation study.
In this section, we discuss the impact of three important
intermediate processes on video reconstruction, including
keyframes, blurry videos, and keyframe captioning. The
quantitative results are in Table 2 and the visualization re-
sults are shown in Figure 4, where all the results of the ab-
lation experiments are from subject 1. Since the keyframe
captioning must be obtained through the keyframe, by
default we eliminate keyframe and keyframe captioning
at the same time. From the quantitative results, it can be
seen that NeuroClips exhibits better pixel-level metrics
without keyframes while showing better semantic-level
metrics without blurry clips. This indicates a trade-off
between semantic and perception reconstruction, which
is similar to the results of a large body of literature on
fMRI-to-image reconstruction [1]. The perception recon-
struction improves the pixel-level performance and the semantic reconstruction improves the semantic
metrics. In addition to this, the best ST-level results for the full model demonstrate the contribution
of each module to video consistency.

For the image captioning method, previous studies [2] have used the GIT [63] model to generate
keyframe captions directly from fMRI embeddings in image space, and we generated it from BLIP-
2 [53]. Here we compare the text generation results of these two approaches as shown in the Figure 4.
We found that GIT’s text generation is slightly homogeneous, filled with a large number of similar
descriptions, such as ’a large body of water’, ’a man is standing’. For the diffusion model, the
influence of text is significant, so GIT’s captions degrade the quality of the semantic reconstruction of
the video, e.g., generating flowers on water from jellyfish keyframes. This shows that keyframe-based
captioning is more flexible compared to representation-based captioning. Finally, we remove the
keyframes and keyframe captions and use only blurred videos to guide the reconstruction, with the
text input replaced with the generic description ’a smooth video’. With this approach, we find that
the model generates the video completely blindly, with poor semantic control, demonstrating the
strong semantic support that keyframes bring to the NeuroClips generation capability. More ablation
analysis can be found in Appendix C.4.

Interpretation Results
To explore the neural interpretability of the model, we visualized voxel-level weights on a brain flat
map, where we can see comprehensive structural attention throughout the whole region, as shown in
Figure 5. It can be seen that the visual cortex occupies an important position regardless of the task. In
addition, for semantic-level reconstruction, the weight distribution of voxels is more spread out over
the higher visual cortex, indicating the semantic level of the video. For perceptual reconstruction, the
weight distribution of voxels is more concentrated on the lower visual cortex, corresponding to the
low-level perception of the human brain. See Appendix C.5 for more subjects’ interpretation results.

weight averaged and normalized to between 0 and 1 and we set the colorbar to 0.25-0.75 for a clear comparison.

Conclusion
In this paper, we present NeuroClips, a novel framework for fMRI-to-video reconstruction. we
implement pixel-level and semantic-level visual learning of fMRI through two paths: perception
reconstruction and semantic reconstruction. With the learned components, we can configure them
into the latest video diffusion models to generate higher quality, higher frame rate, and longer videos
without additional training. NeuroClips recovers videos with more accurate semantic-level precision
and degree of pixel-level matching, establishing a new state-of-the-art in this domain. In addition to
this, we visualized the neuroscience interpretability of NeuroClips with reliable biological principles.

Limitations
Although NeuroClips has achieved high-fidelity, smooth, and consistent multi-fMRI to video recon-
struction, there are still slight flaws. Specifically, our framework is slightly bulky and it relies on
extending keyframes to the reconstructed video. A model that can reconstruct videos from the CLIP
latent space will avoid this intermediate process. Unfortunately, there is no such available model
now. In addition, our method does not reconstruct cross-scene fMRI well, i.e., fMRI recorded during
video clip switching. Even if such fMRI scans are in a tiny minority, this will be a direction for
future research. Moreover, additional subjects and fMRI recordings should be considered in order to
reflect real-world visual experiences sufficiently. However, The alleviation of these limitations will
require joint advances in multiple areas and significant further effort will be required. This is because
improvements in these areas need to be supported by common developments including machine
learning, computer vision, brain science, and biomedicine.

More Implementation Details
Training Details. For Semantic Reconstructor, We first train the fMRI-to-keyframe alignment for 30
epochs with a batch size of 240 and then tune the Diffusion Prior for 150 epochs with a batch size of
64. For Perceptual Reconstructor, we train it for 150 epochs and the batch size is set to 40. We use
the AdamW [64] for optimization, with a learning rate set to 3e-4, to which the OneCircle learning
rate schedule [65] was set. Mixing coefficients δ and µ are set to 30 and 1.
Inference Process. In the phase of inference, we use AnimateDiff v3 [44] with Stable Diffusion v1.5
based motion module. The scene model is selected as RealisticVisionV60, and keyframe control is
implemented by RGB condition with SparseCtrl [66]. For the video diffusion model, the text prompt
is set to the keyframe captioning + ’,8k uhd, dslr, soft lighting, high quality, film grain, Fujifilm
XT3’ and the negative prompt is fixed to ’semi-realistic, cgi, 3d, render, sketch, cartoon, drawing,
anime, text, close up, cropped, out of frame, worst quality, low quality, jpeg artifacts, ugly, duplicate,
morbid, mutilated, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, mutation,
deformed, blurry, dehydrated, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra limbs, cloned face, disfigured,
gross proportions, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, extra arms, extra legs, fused fingers,
too many fingers, long neck’.
Visualization Software. We use the Connectome Workbench from Human Connectome Project
(HCP), and flatmap templates were selected as ’Q1-Q6_R440.L.flat.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii’ and Q1-
Q6_R440.R.flat.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii’. Additionally, the cortical parcellation was manually delineated
by neuroimaging specialists and neurologists, and aligned with the public templates in FreeSurfer
software with verification. We normalized the voxel weights, scaling them to between 0 and 1. Finally,
to show a better comparison, the Colorbar was chosen to be 0.25-0.75.

More Details about Perception Reconstructor
We elaborate on the architecture of our Temporal Upsampling in Sec 3.1 here. As illustrated in
Figure 6, the Temporal Upsampling module consists of Spatial Layer, Temporal Attention, Learnable
Residual Connection, and Upsampling.
The input embedding EY of Temporal Upsampling has five di-
mensions, i.e. EY ∈Rb×Nf ×c×h×w (To express concisely, we
have drawn only its Nf, h, and w in Figure 6.) Before feeding EY
into the spatial layer, we reshape it to Espat
Y
∈R(b×Nf )×c×h×w.
First, we conduct modeling in spatial level, using 3D convolu-
tion and spatial attention, formalized as E
′
Y = Spatial(Espat
Y
).
Note that the spatial layer maintains consistent input and output
dimensions so that the dimensions of E
′
Y are exactly the same as
those of Espat
Y
. Then, applying the learnable residual connection:
EY ←η1 ·Espat
Y
+(1−η1)E
′
Y. Subsequently, we reshape EY as
Etemp
Y
∈R(b×h×w)×Nf ×c and input Etemp
Y
to the temporal layer
E
′′
Y = Temporal(Etemp
Y
), which is achieved using Temporal
Attention as mentioned in main text. Similarly, we apply the learn-
able residual connection again: EY ←η2 · Etemp
Y
+ (1 −η2)E
′′
Y.
Finally, we conduct upsampling to the result EY, formalized as
EY ←Upsampling(EY) ∈Rb×Nf ×c′×h′×w′.
We repeat employing the above module in different (c, h, w) until
EY is upsampled to the target dimensions.

Here we elaborate on the three loss functions in Equation 4.

BiMixCo Loss. BiMixCo aligns the keyframe Xc and its corresponding fMRI signal Yc using bidi-
rectional contrastive loss and MixCo data augmentation. The MixCo needs to mix two independent
fMRI signals. For each Yc, we random sample another fMRI Ymc, which is the keyframe of the clip
index by mc. Then, we mix Yc and Ymc using a linear combination:
Y∗
c = mix(Yc, Ymc) = λc · Yc + (1 −λc)Ymc,

Then, we adapt the ridge regression to map Y∗

Prior Loss. We use the Diffusion Prior to transform fMRI embedding eYc into the reconstructed
OpenCLIP embedding of keyframe ere
Xc. Similar to DALLE·2, Diffusion Prior predicts the target
embeddings with mean-squared error (MSE) as the supervised objective:
LPrior = EeXc,eYc,ϵ∼N(0,1)||ϵ(eYc) −eXc||.
(9)
Reftm Loss. In addition to image representation-level alignment, the assistance of text can aid in
generating semantically more compatible images. Considering the inconsistency in the number and
dimension of image and text tokens, the previous approaches mostly align the 257 tokens of the
image with the CLS token of the text after globally averaging the pooling projection. In this paper,
we ignore the CLS token and only map fMRI to 256 tokens of images, so the projection layer of
the alignment needs to be adjusted. We develop the Reftm to achieve the alignment between the
reconstruction-embedding ere
Xc and its corresponding text embedding eTc (the text Tc is generated
by BLIP2 captioning according to the GT keyframe). To align the dimension of reconstruction-
embedding ere
Xc and that of text embedding eTc, we add an adjusted projector P(·). The adjusted
projector directly maps 256 tokens of ere
Xc to the dimension of text embedding. We fine-tuned the
projector for 20 epochs on the MSCOCO dataset, which consists of 73k images and 5 texts in each
image. And in the training phase of NeuroClips, the projector was frozen. Table 3 displays the effect
of fine-tuning.

More Experimental Results
C.1
Visualizing Reconstructed Keyframe and Text
We display the reconstructed keyframes and their corresponding text in Figure 7. It can be observed
that the reconstructed keyframes and ground truth exhibit an extremely high semantic similarity.
These results demonstrate the ability of our Semantic Reconstructor to reconstruct semantic-accuracy
keyframes and corresponding text descriptions. This reconstructed keyframe contains not only the
correct object categories but also detailed information such as object position, color, scene structure,
etc., which is crucial for reconstructing high-fidelity videos.
Figure 7: The reconstructed keyframe and its corresponding text. Best viewed with zoom in.
C.2
Visualizing More Successful Reconstructions
We visualized more successfully reconstructed videos in Figure 8. As it can be seen, our NeuroClips is
capable of successfully reconstructing videos with correct semantics, covering various categories such
as portraits, objects, animals, and natural scenes, demonstrating the effectiveness of our Semantic
Reconstructor. By conducting detailed comparisons with the ground truth visual stimulus, we find
that the structural information and motions in the videos could also be reconstructed, such as the size
of the main objects, their positions within the scene and the direction in which a person walks. This
demonstrates the critical addition of blurred video to motion and structural information.
We further show videos that are successfully reconstructed by all three subjects in Figure 9, which
demonstrated generalization of the model. What’s more, we find that these videos often consist
of simple backgrounds featuring portraits, animals, or objects, as well as some natural scenes. By
comparing the reconstruction results of the three subjects, we discover an interesting phenomenon:
the perceived size of objects in simple scenes varies between individuals. For example, the sizes of the
jellyfish and airplane reconstructed from different subjects’ fMRI show significant differences. These
results also suggest, to some extent, the differences in the human visual system among individuals.
C.3
Visualizing Incorrect Reconstructions
Incorrect results often provide more insights. Therefore, we present some of the incorrect reconstruc-
tion results generated by NeuroClips in Figure 10. Most incorrect reconstruction clips arise from
semantic errors, leading to confusion between semantically similar items, such as fish and turtle, man
and woman, and cat and dog. This type of error may arise from two main reasons. On the one hand,
the semantic accuracy of the keyframes we reconstructed may be insufficient. We attempt to use
17

fMRI embedding to retrieve from a pool of keyframe image representations. When the size of the
retrieval pool is set to 300, the retrieval accuracy on the test set is approximately 0.22, indicating that
there is still significant improvement room for visual semantics encapsulated by the fMRI embedding.
On the other hand, the test set may encounter out-of-distribution issues relative to the training set,
where semantic categories present in the test set are not seen in the training set, making semantic
reconstruction challenging to generalize on the test set.

video generated by fMRI. Best viewed with zoom in.

C.4
More Ablation Results
Figure 11: Visualization of ablation study.
The first frame of the blurry video provides structural
information for the reconstruction of the keyframes
and motion information for the generation of the
video. Here, we perform the ablation visualization
of the blurry video to observe its role in perception
reconstruction. Although the building can still be
generated with the blurry video removed as shown in
Figure 11, the shape difference from the original im-
age is too large, indicating the structural information
provided by the blur video. In addition, with the ad-
dition of the blurred video guidance, the camera view
is progressively upward, similar to the original image,
but with the removal of the blurred video, the cam-
era view is encircled, suggesting that the perception
reconstruction provides motion guidance.
C.5
More Interpretation Results
Figure 12: Additional visualization of voxel-wise weights. Best viewed with zoom in.
In Section 7, we visualized voxel-level weights on a brain flat map for subject 1. Here we provide
detailed visualization results for all three subjects from the cc2017 dataset, as shown in Figure
12. As can be seen from the Figure, the three subjects learned similar weights in the Perception
Reconstructor, which echoes the subjects’ comparable SSIM metrics in Table 1 and demonstrates the
existence of commonality in low-level vision in humans. However, the weights learned by subject 3
in the Semantic Reconstructor are different from the other subjects, which also leads to its image
retrieval accuracy being at a lower value, as shown in Table 4. This may indicate that there were
differences in the understanding of the video between subjects.
20

C.6
Results of Retrieval Metrics
We further evaluate the performance of our Semantic Reconstructor using Top-1 keyframe retrieval
accuracy and Top-1 fMRI retrieval accuracy. For keyframe retrieval, each test fMRI Yc is first
converted to an fMRI embedding eYc, and we compute the cosine similarity to its respective CLIP
keyframe embedding eXc and 299 other randomly selected CLIP keyframe embedding in the test
set. For each test sample, success is determined if the cosine similarity is greatest between the fMRI
embedding and its respective CLIP keyframe embedding (aka top-1 retrieval performance, random
chance is 1/300). The test set contains 1,200 fMRI-keyframe pairs, and we randomly divide it into 4
parts (thus each part contains 300 test pairs) for retrieval evaluation. We report the average retrieval
accuracy among 4 parts. The same procedure is used for fMRI retrieval, except fMRI and keyframe
are flipped. Table 4 displays the retrieval performance.
Table 4: The top-1 retrieval accuracy for each subject.
Subject

subject 1
23.1%
20.7%
subject 2
26.3%
19.8%
subject 3
17.3%
15.9%
Unlike the latest techniques for fMRI image reconstruction (where retrieval accuracy can reach more
than 90%), NeuroClips’ retrieval accuracy on the cc2017 dataset averages around 22%, which is at
the lower end of the scale. Leaving aside the difference between fMRI in image stimuli and video
stimuli, we found that the cc2017 test set had a large number of categories of objects that did not
appear in the training set. This is likely to be the main reason for the low retrieval accuracy and is
also the reason why most of the previous studies have focused on low-level visual reconstruction. In
the future, a large-scale fMRI-video dataset more compatible with deep learning is worth looking
forward to.
D
Is NeuroClips Credible?
A big difference in NeuroClips’ video generation inference is that we freeze the weights of the video
diffusion model, while MinD-Video fine-tunes it. This raises the question of whether our generation
relies exclusively on the knowledge base that the video diffusion model has been trained on, and is
not consistent with the distribution of video training data related to fMRI.
Firstly, since our keyframes are control conditions as first frames, the content of our video generation
is closely related to the keyframes, both semantically and structurally. So in NeuroClips, the
video diffusion model will not rely entirely on its own semantic knowledge to generate videos,
but on the keyframes. Secondly, for keyframe generation, keyframes are generated by SDXL
unCLIP. The normal version of SDXL unCLIP generates images from a larger dimensional text
representation space, which was fine-tuned for 6 epochs by Scotti et al. [2] on MSCOCO with image
representations. The fine-tuned version of SDXL unCLIP provides a 256×1664 large dimensional
CLIP representation space, which has a strong correspondence with the pixel space of the image,
as shown in Figure 13. The SDXL unCLIP we use is this fine-tuned version. The videos captured
from the cc2017 dataset used in this paper are from Videoblocks (https://www.videoblocks.com) and
YouTube (https://www.youtube.com). These videos are not part of the COCO dataset, but SDXL
unCLIP can still restore the original images as shown in Figure 13, demonstrating the equivalence of
its representation space and pixel space. Since NeuroClips trained Semantic Reconstructor to align
fMRI to this representation space, this also shows that our keyframe reconstruction is closely related
to fMRI training.

Broader Impacts
Our research is dedicated to exploring the possibilities of neural decoding using deep learning
techniques, which have a positive impact on the field of neuroscience. With the expansion of model
scales and the improvement of corresponding hardware devices, this research will also make positive
contributions to the field of brain-computer interfaces. However, this research also highlights the
importance of personal privacy and security. Governments and research institutions should take
appropriate measures to protect the privacy data collected and prevent any potential misuse. In our
research, we use publicly available and de-identified datasets, so the study strictly adheres to relevant
ethical requirements.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist
1. Claims
Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our abstract and introduction clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.
• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.
2. Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We create a separate "Limitations" section in our Appendix to discuss the
limitations of our works.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.
• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when the image
resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might
not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to
handle technical jargon.
• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.
• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.
• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs
Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?
23

Answer: [NA]
Justification: The novelty of our work is focused on the application level and does not
involve theoretical results.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.
• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.
• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. Experimental Result Reproducibility
Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide detailed experimental details in the paper and appendix to ensure
the reproducibility of our work. In addition, we will make the code and weight files public
if the paper is accepted.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.
• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.
• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.
(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.
(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).
(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
24

5. Open access to data and code
Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We use publicly available datasets and provide anonymous links to our project.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).
• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).
• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide the key experimental setup in the paper and provide the complete
experimental setup in our Appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment Statistical Significance
Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We report the average and standard deviation of multiple runs to make the
experimental results statistically significant.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.
25

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).
• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.
• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.
• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).
• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. Experiments Compute Resources
Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We provide sufficient information on the computer resources.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).
9. Code Of Ethics
Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our research conducted in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of
Ethics in every respect.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.
• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. Broader Impacts
Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We discuss the potential societal impacts of our work in the Appendix.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
26

• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.
• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. Safeguards
Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work poses no such risks.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.
• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.
12. Licenses for existing assets
Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: The creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the
paper, are properly credited. And the license and terms of use are explicitly included in our
code repository.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.
• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
27

• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.
• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.
• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
13. New Assets
Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our anonymized URL includes these new codes, new results, and related
documentation.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human
Subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: Our work does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects.
Guidelines:
• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
28

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.
• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.
• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
